OPTIMAL CONTROL OF LARGE SPACE STRUCTURES VIA 
GENERALIZED INVERSE MATRIX jt

'"^'^ Independent Modal Space Control (IMSC) is a control scheme 
that decouples the space structure into n independent second-order 
subsystenns according to n controlled rrodes and controls each 
mode independently. It is well-known that the IMSC eliminates 
control and observation spillover caused when the conventional 
coupled modal control scheme is employed. The independent 
control of each mode requires that the number of actuators be 
equal to the number of modelled modes, which is very high for a 
faithful miodeling of large space structures. A control scheme is 
proposed that allows one to use a reduced number of actuators 
to control all modeled modes suboptimally. In particular, the method 
of generalized inverse matrices is employed to implement the 
actuators such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system 
are as closed as possible to those specified by the optimal IMSC. 
Computer simulation of the proposed control scheme on a simply 
supported beam is given. Author

A control-augmented structural synthesis methodology is 
presented in which the structural member sizes and active control 
system feedback gains are treated simultaneously as independent 
design variables. Multiple static and harmonic dynamic loading 
conditions are considered. Constraints are imposed on static 
displacements, natural frequencies, and the magnitudes of the 
steady-state dynamic displacements and actuator forces to ensure 
acceptable system behavior. Side constraints imposed on the 
design variables protect against the generation of unrealizable 
designs. Example problems are presented that demonstrate the 
method and underscore the importance of integrating the structural 
and active control system design process. Author

Concern based on historical precedent led to early investment 
of resources to identify Space Station viewing requirements in 
order that they could be transferred to module window designs, 
cupolas, indirect viewing methods (e.g., closed circuit television), 
and implemented in cost models tracking overall station 
configuration weight and cost. Previous space history and earth 
based analogs were used to identify needs and requirements 
relevant to long term missions. Author

Interest in materials processing in space began to evolve in 
the tate 1950's through low gravity simulation and some 
experiments on Apollo flights. Encouraged by the early results 
and considerations of the likely behavior of liquids and solidification 
process in low-gravity gave the recognition that this environment 
might be useful for a variety of unique processes. This generated 
a number of experimental ideas and gave rise to the design and 
development of facilities that will perform the experiments in space 
vehicles. These include the evolution of apparatus leading to the 
development of facilities for processing of materials on Skylab 
and now for the Space Transportation System (STS). The U.S. 
module on Space Station (SS) is going to expand this unique 
laboratory environment with practically no constraint on materials 
processing activity. This will need technology advancement for 
the hardware that will be required in this era. This presentation 
discusses the current concept for the experimental facility which 
will be housed in the U.S. Laboratory module on the Space Station 
and will allow the growth of single crystals of polymeric and organic 
materials using the state-of-the-art growth techniques. Author

The design and operational capabilities of the Industrial Space 
Facility (iSF), a man-tended space platform that is to be placed 
on the Space Station, are described. The ISF is composed of two 
types of modules; facility modules and auxiliary modules. The facility 
is to operate in a circular orbit inclined 28.5 deg at orbital altitudes 
ranging from 160-220 nm and is to provide about 10 kW of power 
and cooling and telemetry capabilities. The ISF is to be used 
primarily for research and manufacturing of materials, and its 
modular design will permit easy growth to meet additional service 
and power demands. The initial deployment sequence and the 
servicing mission to resupply the ISF are discussed. Diagrams of 
the ISF and its modules are provided. I.F.

Project Pathfinder is a proposed U.S. Space Research and 
Technology program intended to enable bold new missions of 
space exploration. Pathfinder continues the advancement of 
technological capabilities and extends the foundation established 
under the Civil Space Technology Initiative, CSTI. By filling critical 
technological gaps, CSTI enhances access to Earth orbit and 
supports effective operations and science missions therein. 
Pathfinder, with a longer-term horizon, looks to a future that builds 
on Shuttle and Space Station and addresses technologies that 
support a range of exploration missions including: a return to the 
Moon to build an outpost; piloted missions to Mars; and continued 
scientific exploration of Earth and the other planets. The program's 
objective is to develop, within reasonable time frames, those

Results of three of the most significant studies completed as 
part of Work Package 1 of the U.S. Space Station are reported. 
In particular, water reclamation techniques have been developed 
using multifiltration methods and reverse osmosis with both 
longitudinal hollow fibers and spiral wound sheet structures. In 
the course of another study, methods of on-orbit pressurized 
module repair have been tested using the Neutral Buoyancy Test 
Facility at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). The discussion

An account is given of the design features and design 
methodology used in response to requirements for an SSTO vehicle 
for the servicing of the NASA Space Station. The SSTO spacecraft 
conforms to a 165-kt minimum landing speed, the use of L0X/LH2 
propellants, and payload sizes of 20,000 lbs to LEO and 40,000 
lbs to earth. By comparison with the Space Shuttle (including 
external tank and solid rocket boosters), which weighs 4.5 million 
lbs and is 184 ft long, the SSTO craft would weigh 4.68 million 



lbs and be 252 ft in length; the comparable weight of the much 
larger craft would be due primarily to the use of advanced structural 
and component technologies. O.C.

The 'design-to-performance' method of controller design for a 
satellite of the level of complexity represented by the NASA Space 
Station is used to arrive at both on-orbit plant characteristics and 
a digital system for the control of this plant. Attention is given to 
the core technologies enabling the implementation of this method, 
as well as to their development status; actual sensor data obtained 
as a result of simple on-orbit tests are invoked. The use of 
sampled-data theory requires a minimum of sensors and 
actuators. O.C.

Plans for space science activities on the International Space 
Station are reviewed from a NASA perspective. The present Station 
reference configuration is based on a dual-keel core unit (one 
habitation module and three laboratory modules supplied by NASA, 
ESA, and Japan) and provides for five attached systems (with up 
to four payloads each to be exposed to space) and several 
free-flying platforms (both polar orbiters and coorbiters). Particular 
attention is given to the space science aspects of the primary 
Station objectives defined by NASA (servicing and repair, platforms, 
pressurized modules, and attached payloads). Also discussed are 
the work of the Task Force on Scientific Uses of Space Station, 
the need for operational flexibility, the value of a continuous manned 
presence for experimental science, and the skills needed from 
the Station crew. T.K.

p. 149-155. 

The current availability of ground-based and space microgravity 
facilities for research in fluid science is surveyed, and the 
implications of the findings for Space Station planning are 
considered. Consideration is given to fluid-science facilities, flight 
opportunities, time between flights, time allotted per experiment, 
experiments per flight, fields investigated, parameters measured, 
postflight data collection procedures, and the quality of the 
microgravity environment. Statistical data based on the author's 
experience are presented in extensive tables and graphs, and it 
is concluded that, under current conditions, the time required to 
acquire 100 data points in a typical experiment is 5 months on 
the ground but over 12.5 years in space. Recommendations include 
expansion and extended availability of different kinds of space 
microgravity facilities, support for commercial microgravity R&D in 
space, and greater international information exchange and 
cooperation. T.K.

The operational environment of the Space Station will differ 
considerably from the previous short term missions such as the 
Spacelabs. Limited crew availability combined with the near 
continuous operation of Space Station facilities will require a high 
degree of facility automation. This paper will discuss current efforts 
to develop automated flight hardware for advanced protein crystal 
growth on the Space Station. Particular areas discussed will be 
the automated monitoring of key growth parameters for vapor 
diffusion growth and proposed mechanisms for control of these 
parameters. A history of protein crystal growth efforts will be 
presented in addition to the rationale and need for improved protein 
crystals for X-ray diffraction. The facility will be capable of 
simultaneously processing several hundred protein samples at 
various temperatures, pH's, concentrations etc., and provide 
allowances for real time variance of growth parameters. Author

In French. 

The on-board instrumentation and orbital parameters of the 
SPOT 1 earth observing satellite are discussed. Total earth 
coverage is achieved by SPOT in a circular sun-synchronous orbit 
at 822 km altitude with an orbital inclination of 98.7 deg. SPOT 
makes 14 -f- 5/26 revolutions per day, and completes its cycle of 
earth coverage each 26 days. The high-resolution (20-10 m) optical 
instruments on-board SPOT can produce 1/100,000 topographic 
maps. The ability to obtain views of a single region many times 
during the 26-day cycle allows the study of rapidly changing 
phenomena. The series of 6000 CCD detectors can simultaneously 
image a 60-km field at 10-m resolution. R.R.

The aerothermodynamic (AID) characteristics of proposed

illustrated with extensive diagrams, graphs, and tables of numerical 
data. Vehicles considered are a Mach 5 transport aircraft, the 
winged airbreathing first stage and winged second stage of an

properties at different altitudes are summarized; a brief ATD

and typical hypersonic flow phenomena are described. It is argued 
that the wind-tunnel facilities presently available in the FRG are

The basic objective of the Space Station (SS) Mission Planning 
System (MPS) Development Study was to define a baseline Space 
Station mission plan and the associated hardware and software 
requirements for the system. A detailed definition of the Spacelab 
(SL) payload mission planning process and SL Mission Integration 
Planning System (MIPS) software was derived. A baseline concept 
was developed for performing SS manned base payload mission 
planning, and it was consistent with current Space Station 
design/operations concepts and philosophies. The SS MPS 
software requirements were defined. Also, requirements for new 
software include candidate programs for the application of artificial 
intelligence techniques to capture and make more effective use 
of mission planning expertise. A SS MPS Software Development 
Plan was developed which phases efforts for the development 
software to implement the SS mission planning concept. B.G.

The process and existing software used for Spacelab payload 
mission planning were studied. A complete baseline definition of 
the Spacelab payload mission planning process was established, 
along with a definition of existing software capabilities for potential 
extrapolation to the Space Station. This information was used as 
a basis for defining system requirements to support Space Station 
mission planning. The Space Station mission planning concept 
was reviewed for the purpose of identifying areas where artificial 
intelligence concepts might offer substantially improved capability. 
Three specific artificial intelligence concepts were to be investigated 
for applicability: natural language interfaces; expert systems; and 
automatic programming. The advantages and disadvantages of 
interfacing an artificial intelligence language with existing FORTRAN 
programs or of converting totally to a new programming language 
were identified. B.G.

A software development plan is presented for the definition, 
design, and implementation of the Space Station (SS) Payload 
Mission Planning System (MPS). This plan is an evolving document 
and must be updated periodically as the SS design and operations 
concepts as well as the SS MPS concept evolve. The major 
segments of this plan are as follows: an overview of the SS MPS 
and a description of its required capabilities including the computer 
programs identified as configurable items with an explanation of 
the place and function of each within the system; an overview of 
the project plan and a detailed description of each development 
project activity breaking each into lower level tasks where 
applicable; identification of the resources required and

This study effort has shown that the development of a space 
robotic servicing system is totally feasible. More importantly, many 
of the key elements of such a system are currently available as 
the result of previous and ongoing technical efforts. In many cases, 
decisions remain to be made concerning tradeoffs between options 
available to satisfy system technology requirements. The primary 
recommendation resulting from this study is for the development 
of a flight test bed system that could be used to establish a 
performance database to assist some of the necessary technical 
decisions described in the study package. A properly design flight 
test bed system would prove tremendously useful in terms of 
rapidly evaluating technology in a realistic setting and would be a 
great benefit in the development of the operational system.

The Space Platform Interferometer (SPI), a 20-m two-mirror 
Michelson interferometer, which can reach magnitude 14 at UV 
and visible wavelengths, is described. The SPt is attached to a 
platform serviced from the space station. In addition to its ability 
to produce unique science in the UV, SPI is intended to demonstrate 
the feasibility of larger projects in the field. Dynamical behavior of 
the structure in the gravity gradient environment and fringe 
stabilization at low photon rate are studied by picking up an adjacent 
bin (in the near IR) on the same object and using it to track the 
white light fringe in a separate differential interferometer. The same 
subsystem also corrects for tilt. Active control of critical parameters 
ensures optical rigidity. Performances are evaluated in low orbit.

volumes. Ten alternative schematic interior designs were proposed. 
Preliminary conclusions include: (1) in-service interior modifications 
may be necessary and should be planned for; (2) design complexity 
will be increased if the module cluster is reduced from five to 
three; (3) the increased crew circulation attendant upon 
enhancement of space station activity may produce human traffic 
bottlenecks and should be planned for; (4) a single- or two-person 
quiet area may be desirable to provide crew members with needed 
solitude during waking hours; and (5) the decision to choose a 
two-shift or three-shift daily cycle will have a significant impact on 
the design configuration and operational efficiency of the human 
habitat. J.P.B.

FACILE is a computer program that aids in the design of interior 
layouts for complex facilities like the Space Station. The program 
supports three kinds of functions: design, evaluation, and 
simulation. The design features of FACILE include a 
direct-manipulation style of user interface for defining and 
manipulating the functional compartments of the facility. The 
evaluation features include the capability of quantitatively 
comparing any candidate layout against five crew-interface criteria: 
crew movement, sequential dependencies, shared support 
equipment, noise interference, and privacy requirements. The 
simulation features include the capability of simulating the activities 
of any number of crew members within the candidate layout. 
Statistics such as crew movement distances, compartment usage 
rates, and queuing times waiting for compartments are available 
from the simulations. Author

control of these subsystems into an effective system which 
revitalizes the air in all habitable areas needs to be evaluated. 
From such an evaluation, the size of subsystems, size and location

The design of NASA's space station has begun. During the 
design cycle, and after activation of the space station, the 
reoccurring need will exist to access not only designs, but also 
deeper knowledge about the designs, which is only hinted in the 
design definition. Areas benefiting from this knowledge include 
training, fault management, and onboard automation. NASA's 
Artificial Intelligence Office at Johnson Space Center and The 
MITRE Corporation have conceptualized an approach for capture 
and storage of design knowledge. Author

Some of the fundamental issues and tradeoffs for distributed 
execution systems for the Ada language are examined. Steps that 
need to be taken to deal with heterogeneity of addressing program 
objects, of processing resources, and of the individual processor 
environment are considered. The ways in which program elements 
can be assigned are examined in the context of four issues: implied 
remote object access, object visibility and recursive execution, task 
termination problems, and distributed types. CD.

The lessons learned from the Solar Mesosphere Explorer have 
been the key to the development of a low-cost model for spacecraft 
operations. Principles of project management, integrated design, 
lifecyle continuity, and human factors management have been 
developed that will help guide the development of the next 
generation of space missions. This model has been applied to 
several NASA projects, including Space Station studies and the 
Mars Observer mission. Using this approach has lowered costs 
and has given scientists the capability of interactively controlling

their instruments from their home laboratories. In follow-on studies, 
generic operations system tools have been developed as part of

The region above the earth from about 90 km to 150 km is a 
major part of the upper or outer atmosphere. It is relatively 
unexplored, being too high for balloons or aircraft and too low for 
persistent orbiting spacecraft. However, the concept of a tethered 
subsatellite, deployed downward from an orbiting, more massive 
craft such as the Space Shuttle, opens the possibility of a research 
capability that could provide global mapping of this region. The 
need for research in this thick spherical shell above the earth 
falls into two major categories: (1) scientific data for understanding 
and modeling the global atmosphere and thereby determining its 
role in the earth system, and (2) engineering data for the design 
of future aerospace vehicles that will operate there. This paper 
presents an overview and synthesis of the currently perceived 
research needs and the state-of-the-art of the proposed tethered 
research capability. Author

An efficient multilevel deisgn optimization technique is 
presented. The proposed method is based on the concept of 
providing linearized information between the system level and 
subsystem level optimization tasks. The advantages of the method 
are that it does not require optimum sensitivities, nonlinear equality 
constraints are not needed, and the method is relatively easy to 
use. The disadvantage is that the coupling between subsystems 
is not dealt with in a precise mathematical manner. Author

This paper introduces a new measurement system optimization 
technique which can be implemented on-line in time-varying, 
continous-time systems. A case in which several measurement 
subsystems are available, each one of which may serve to drive 
a state estimation algorithm, is considered. However, due to 
practical implementation constraints, only one of these sybsystems 
can actually be used at a time. An algorithm is needed, by which 
the optimal measurement subsystem to be used at a certain time 
interval is selected at each measurement configuration epoch. The 
approach taken to solve this problem is based on using the square 
root continuous-time V-lambda filter as the underlying state 
estimation algorithm. This algorithm continously provides its user 
with the special factors of the estimation error covariance matrix, 
which are, in turn, used in this work as the basis for an on-line 
decision procedure by which the optimal measurement strategy is 
derived- A numerical example is presented, which demonstrates 
the performance of the new algorithm. Author

consistent friendly and flexible interactive user interface. TAE also 
supplies the interface between the user and the various application 
programs in a particular computer system. It appears to be an 
effective user interface for infrequent as well as for expert users.

Programming of the space station is to be done in the Ada 
programming language. A breadboard of selected parts of the 
work package for Marshall Space Flight Center is to be built, and 
programming this small part will be a good testing ground for 
Ada. One coding of the upper levels of the design brings out 
several problems with top-down design when it is to be carried 
out strictly within the language. Ada is evaluated on the basis of 
this experience, and the points raised are compared with other 
experience as related in the literature. Rapid prototyping is another 
approach to the initial programming; several different types of 
prototypes are discussed, and compared with the art of 
specification. Some solutions are proposed and a number of 
recommendations presented. Author

The role of verification and validation (V and V) in software 
has been to support and strengthen the software lifecycle and to 
ensure that the resultant code meets the standards of the 
requirements document. Knowledge based systems (KBS) V and 
V should serve the same role, but the KBS lifecycle is ill-defined. 
Here, the rationale of the simple form of the KBS lifecycle is 
explained. Special KBS development requirements are 
accommodated where possible by modifications to the traditional 
software lifecycle. Research areas are suggested for those aspects 
which present new or unusual difficulties for V and V. Author

It has become clear from measurements of the acceleration 
environment in the Spacelab that the residual gravity levels on 
board a spacecraft in low Earth orbit can be significant and should 
be of concern to experimenters who wish to take advantage of 
the low gravity conditions on future Spacelab missions and on 
board the Space Station. The basic goals are to better understand 
the low gravity tolerance of three classes of materials science 
experiments: crystal growth from a melt, a vapor, and a solution. 
The results of the research will provide guidance toward the 
determination of the sensitivity of the low gravity environment, the 
design of the laboratory facilites, and the timelining of materials 
science experiments. To data, analyses of the effects of 
microgravity environment were, with a few exceptions, restricted 
to order of magnitude estimates. Preliminary results obtained from 
numerical models of the effects of residual steady and time 
dependent acceleration are reported on: heat, mass, and 
momentum transport during the growth of a dilute alloy by the 
Bridgman-Stockbarger technique, and the response of a simple 
fluid physics experiment involving buoyant convection in a square 
cavity. B.G.

The space station must unite the properties and behavior of 
individual and place, using proportions from both to make whole 
the understanding of ourselves at this moment in evolution. 
Harmonious proportions in any environment are similar to the 
acceptance and enjoyment of the harmony of many well-tuned 
musical instruments. A well-tuned or well-ordered environment 
tends to have invisible proportions. They produce order but do 
not intrude on the perception and cognitive mapping of the 
environment. Systems of proportion are not ends in themselves 
but are a means to select a series of spaces which relate one to 
another in dimensionally specific terms. These internal relationships 
create a whole when the forms are harmonious. This harmonic 
relationship is of intrinsic value for individuals to be physically and 
psychologically in balance with their universe. Author

which bend in the middle to allow the cell to collapse. The strut 
tubes were fabricated with unidirectional preimpregnated graphite 
tape. Hinge fittings, tube end fittings, and truss nodes were

For application in the European Columbus project, the ERM 
(Extendable and Retractable Mast) has been selected as the most 
universal concept. Both the Resource Module and the Polar 
Platform require large solar generators of different sizes up to 18 
kW. The modular design of the ERM can easily be adapted to 
different deployment lengths. Though the reliable array type has 
been chosen as the baseline, the ERM is also able to deploy 
rigid panel arrays. In addition the ERM will be used to position 
reflector antennas away from the module. The design is based 
on the telescopic principle using circular shaped graphite/epoxy 
tube sections for high stiffness and good thermal stability. The 
telescope is driven by a spindle/nut system, allowing the extension 
of the mast section by section. Author

Recent progress in the area of structural dynamics of large 
space structures is reviewed. Topics include system identification, 
large angle slewing of flexible structures, definition of scaling 
limitations in structural models, and recent results on a 
tension-stabilized antenna concept known as the hoop-column. 
Increasingly complex laboratory experiments guide most of the 
activities leading to realistic technological developments. 
Theoretical progress in system identification based on system 
realization theory resulting in unification of several methods is 
reviewed. Experimental results from implementation of a theoretical 
large-angle slewing control approach are shown. Status and results 
of the development of a research computer program for analysis 
of the transient dynamics of large angle motion of flexible structures 
are presented. Correlation of results from analysis and vibration 
tests of the hoop-column antenna concept are summarized.

The paper presents a general three-dimensional truss system 
(COPPATRUSS) that appears uniquely capable of satisfying the 
requirements for very large foundation structures in space. The 
currently patented system obtains perhaps the highest structural 
efficiency (strength /mass and stiffness/ mass) possible in a general 
space truss. In addition it offers great architectural variety, 
modularity, fabrication economy, low package volume for launch, 
and rapid, principally automated, assembly in space. An example 
of an application to the Solar Power Satellite is discussed.

An accordian type of deploynnent mechanism is under 
development for the deployment of solar arrays of the Indian 
Remote Sensing Satellite. A mathematical model for studying the 
effect of flexibility of Closed Control Loops (CCLs) on the 
deployment dynamics of such arrays has been formulated using 
Lagrange's method. The mathematical model involving dynamically 
coupled nonlinear simultaneous equations has been solved 
numerically after decoupling the second order terms using matrix 
transformation. This model has been used to choose a suitable 
spring in the CCLs to obtain a near synchronous deployment of 
the yoke and panels. Further, the effects due to variation of 
coefficient of friction, temperature and medium in which the arrays 
are deployed have been incorporated in the model. Author

Inflatable, chemically rigidized space structures are applicable 
to a wide range of functions. A 2.8-m offset antenna reflector, for 
operation at 3.63 GHz, has been subjected to mechanical and 
electrical tests, to serve as a precursor for larger structures, such 
as those discussed for land mobile applications. Surface accuracies 
of 0.6 mm rms were achieved. Both folding and curing processes 
were found to have a negligible impact on the reflector's quality. 
The electrical performance has been shown to be predictable on

This paper presents the result of recent research and 
development of the tension truss antenna. The tension truss 
antenna is the deployable, mesh-surfaced space antenna, whose 
geodesic-truss-like reflector surface is realized by a pre-tensioned 
cable structure. A 3-m-diameter engineering model has been built 
for the purpose of identifying the technical problem area and testing 
the surface shape control algorithm. The principal feature of the 



tension truss antenna is that the surface shape is uniquely 
determined by the lengths and arrangement of truss cable 
composing the reflector surface, and is independent of the cable 
tension. An algorithm of surface shape control has been established 
taking advantage of this intrinsic nature of the concept. Any local 
deviation of the reflector surface can be adjusted by changing the 
length of said local cables and it does not influence the other 
part of the reflector. This algorithm has been tested using the 
model and the result has shown its effectiveness. In view of these 
results, the tension truss antenna has the potential for a variety 
of space antenna missions. Author

The present paper describes a newly invented two-dimensionally 
deployable truss structure named SHDF, which has no articulated 
members. The most significant feature of SHDF truss is the very 
small number of the mechanisms to be actuated and locked at 
the deployment. A globally flat functional model actuated by tiny 
electromagnetic motors was designed and fabricated. The model 
demonstrated its practicality and virtually synchronized smooth 
motion in deploy/fold tests. Subsequently, the model was reformed 
into a globally parabolic configuration and combined with a 
one-dimensionalty deployable truss named SHSF, which is also 
newly invented. Further deploy/fold tests similarly demonstrated 
the practicality of parabolic SHDF truss structure and the 
compatibility of SHDF with SHSF. Author

An efficient sensitivity analysis method is proposed for 
calculating basic functional variations depending on variations in 
mass and stiffness. The method, which is based on the use of 
adjoint variables and adjoint systems of equations, makes it 
possible to define domains in a structure where redesign should 
be most effective. To calculate the dynamic behavior of large 
unrestrained structures, use is made of the modal analysis method; 
the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of free vibrations are 
determined by the perturbation method and a subspace iteration 
technique taking into account the properties of sparse matrices. 
The problem of rational material distribution in large space 
structures is also discussed, and some numerical examples are 
presented. V.L

Two reduced-order models of a large flexible spacecraft are 
proposed. The first one is expressed in terms of the modes of 
static deformation of the spacecraft and the normal modes of 
vibration of the spacecraft. The reduced-order model can express 
the dynamical behavior of the spacecraft accurately in a low 
frequency region with proper choice of the modes of static 
deformation of the spacecraft. The second one is suited for a 
class of spacecraft composed of the main body with subbodies. 
The reduced-order model Is expressed in terms of two sets of 
the normal modes of vibration, the normal modes of the whole 
spacecraft and the normal modes of the subbodies. The reduced 
order model can easily cope with the change of the structures of 
the subbodies. These reduced order models are illustrated through 
application to a simple spacecraft model. Author

A linear dc motor (LDCM) inertial actuator is being developed 
for use on the Mast Flight System. Both tip mounted and 
intermediate station mast actuators will employ this concept. 
Excitation, damping and structural control will be accomplished 
using these actuators. Performance goals have been established 
for the LDCM which will insure that the Mast Flight System will 
meet its objective as a test bed for development and verification 
of controls/ structures interaction (CSI). The design goals involve 
force output, frequency response, waveform distortion, dynamic 
range, drift compensation and packaging. The present paper 
discusses the design and development of the LDCM. In particular, 
command and compensation strategy trades, sensor resolution 
requirements and motor commutation techniques are considered. 
Also development of a compound pendulum test bed which 
emulates low frequency dynamics of the Mast Flight System is 
reviewed, and test results are presented on excursion performance 
and baseline damping algorithm performance. Author

APPLICATION OF PERTURBATION TECHNIQUES TO

In this paper, a matrix perturbation technique is developed for 
flexible bodies (substructures) that undergo large reference 
translational and rotational displacements. Although the governing 
dynamic equations of motion of such systems are highly nonlinear 
because of the large angular rotations and the resulting nonliner 
inertia coupling between the reference motion and the elastic 
deformation, a generalized linear eigenvalue problem that defines 
the deformation mode shapes of the body with respect to the 
selected body reference is identified. This eigenvalue problem is 
solved only once and the variations in the body stiffness and 
inertia properties due to a change in selected design parameters 
are evaluated by using perturbation analysis techniques. The main 
advantage of using the proposed technique is to avoid a new 
finite element discretization when some design parameters are 
changed. This, in turn, substantially reduces the computational 
time, especially when large scale flexible bodies with complex 
geometry are considered. A numerical example is presented in 
order to demonstrate the use of the perturbation techniques 
developed in this paper in the design of flexible multibody 
systems. Author

The equations of motion of rigid multibody systems, such as 
space structures whose bases are free, are derived using the 
equations of motion of Kane et al. (1983). The equations of motion 
wtiich set the position of the center mass of one body as 
generalized coordinates are first obtained. A technique for deriving 
the equations of motion which set the position of the center of 
mass of the system as generalized coordinates is then proposed 
in which the orbital motion and the attitude motion are treated 
separately. The method is shown to be applicable not only for 
the tree configuration system, but also for the loop configuration 
system with cutting loops, using Lagrange's multipliers as 
constrained forces. R.R.

DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS APPROACH TO THE

This paper presents a distributed parameter estimation scheme 
and investigates its computational merit for three idealized 
examples of the identification of large flexible structures. The 
method retains the distributed nature of the structure throughout 
the development of the algorithm and a finite-element 
approximation is used only to implement the algorithm. This 
approach eliminates many problems associated with the model 
truncation used in other methods of identification. The identification 
problem is formulated in Hilbert spaces and an optimal control 
technique is used to minimize a weighted least squares of error 
between the actual and the model data. A variational approach is 
used to solve the problem. A costate equation, gradients of 
parameter variations and conditions for optimal estimates are 
obtained. Computer simulation studies are conducted using flexible 
beam models as examples. Numerical results show a close match 
between the estimated and true values of the parameters.

The problem of improving the structure and increasing the 
efficiency of globally distributed information/control systems is 
examined with particular reference to the automatic control systems 
of flight vehicles. The problem of the synthesis of the flexible 
structure of complex systems is formulated as a nonlinear 
mathematical programming problem. An optimization-simulation 
approach to the solution of such problems is proposed which 
involves the development of procedures using optimization and 
simulation or computational models for the synthesis of the optimal 
version of the structure. V.L.

A PARAMETER ROBUST LOG DESIGN SYNTHESIS WITH 

APPLICATIONS TO CONTROL OF FLEXIBLE STRUCTURES

An asymptotic LOG design synthesis technique is described 
which explicitly includes a class of structured plant uncertainties 
by viewing plant parameter variations as an internal feedback loop. 
A direct structural relationship between this class of parameter 
uncertainties and the weighting matrices in the design of the LQG 
compensator is exploited by an asymptotic procedure in which 
either the regulator or the filter become insensitive to parameter 
variations. This asymptotic approach represents a generalization 
of the LQG/LTR technique. Controllers designed by this new LQG 



method and LQG/LTR are compared by application to a 
mass-spring-damper system which approximates the dynamics of 
flexible structures. For both colocated and noncolocated sensors 
and actuators configurations, the LQG/LTR design is extremely 
sensitive to parameter variations whereas the new LQG design 
allows considerably improved parameter robustness. Author

ROBUST STABILIZATION UNDER MODE TRUNCATION AND 

PARAMETER VARIATIONS 

RAMA K. YEDAVALLI (Toledo, University, OH) IN: 1987 American 
Control Conference, 6th, Minneapolis, MN, June 10-12, 1987,

(Contract F33615-86-K-3611) 

This paper addresses the issue of stability robustness under 
mode truncation and parameter variations with emphasis on Large 
Space Structures (LSS) models. The recent development of 
elemental (structured) upper bounds on the perturbation of an 
asymptotically stable linear system to maintain stability is extended 
to the problem of LSS control in which both mode truncation 
(model reduction) as well as parameter variations (uncertainty in 
modal frequencies, dampings, and mode shape slopes at 
actuator/ sensor locations) are considered as perturbations acting 
on the control design model. A simple algorithm is proposed to 
design a robust controller, with vibration suppression as the control 
objective, for robust stability and acceptable nominal performance 
under mode truncation and parameter errors. The algorithm is 
such that it clearly delineates the trade off between the control 
effort needed for acceptable regulation and the number of modes 
one needs to control for robust stability. Author

The idea of actively damping vibrations in flexible structure 
systems has received much attention in recent years. Such systems 
present a particular problem in that there is no fixed frame of 
reference for actuation; actuators must then be mounted on the 
structure itself. Currently at Ohio State a laboratory facility is being 
developed to study control of flexible structures; one specific 
configuration is a six foot free-free beam which is suspended from 
the ceiling. Such a beam can be controlled by applying torques 
about the bending axis or by applying transverse forces. Due to 
the size constraints of such a laboratory-scale experiment, a small 
structure with small actuators and sensing devices is utilized. 
Transverse actuators (developed in-house) were chosen for the 
experiment, and sensing is accomplished via several sets of strain 
gauges and accelerometers mounted on the structure. This paper 
discusses issues involved with the modeling of this structure, and 
presents a brief summary of the various control approaches.

Modern modal control methods for flexible structures, based 
on a truncated model of the structure's dynamics, have control 
and observation spillover which can reduce the stability margin of 
the controlled structure. Here, a standard model formulation of a 
distributed-parameter system is presented along with conventional 
control methods. The spillover phenomenon is defined, and the 
advantages and disadvantages of sensor output filtering are 
examined. A new design for a modern modal control system with 
an output filter augmented into the observer is developed. A 
comparison between the different control methods is made using 
a numerical example. CD.

A theory for active control of elastic wave propagation in 
structures is developed. Attention is focused on active modification 
of the scattering behavior of discrete locations in a structural 
network. The wave mode input/output relation at a structural 
junction containing control actuators can be altered in two ways. 
First, the closed loop reflection and transmission coefficients can 
be specified, and the necessary feedback to achieve these 
coefficients determined. Second, an optimal wave controller can 
be formulated which maximizes the average power dissipation at 
a junction. If the open loop structure is stable, then the optimal 
control guarantees stability, since energy is actively dissipated at 
the junction. Sample controllers are derived and simulated for a 
free-free beam to demonstrate the techniques and indicate the 
achievable performance. Author

A homotopy algorithm for solving the optimal projection

in large flexible space structures, is presented. The existence and 
the number of solutions are investigated. It is shown that the 
number of stabilizing solutions to the OPEs can be determined 
and that all solutions can be computed via a homotopic continuation 
from a simple problem. For an important special case, where the 
number of inputs or outputs to the system is less than or equal 
to the dimension of the compensator, there is only one solution 
to the OPE, guaranteeing that globally optimum reduced order 
controller can be computed. CD.

This paper presents an automated procedure useful in the study 
of large constrained flexible structures, undergoing large specified 
motions. The structure is looked upon as a 'partially open tree' 
system, containing closed loops in some of the branches. The 
governing equations are developed using Kane's equations as 
formulated by Huston et al. The accommodation of the constraint 
equations is based on the use of orthogonal complement arrays. 
The flexibility and oscillations of the bodies is modeled using finite 
segment modeling, structure analysis, and scaling techniques. The 
procedures developed are expected to be useful in applications 
including robotics, space structures, and biosystems. Author

The procedure proposed by Baruch (1985) for designing

respect to inversion (Wilkinson, 1965) of the basic matrix A; its 
usefulness is demonstrated in a numerical example involving a

design dimensions may be further reduced, in the interest of weight 
savings, without compromising the safety margins of structural 
integrity. The transient vibrations in six axes simulated with the 
apparatus correspond to forces acting on the spacecraft during 
launch and flight; the system is sufficiently ample to allow testing 
of major subcomponents of large structures. O.C.

An area of concern for the design of large space structures is 
the amount of structural damping which will be present. The joints 
used to assemble a large, light weight structure like the Space 
Station will provide some damping; however, an accepted 
methodology for predicting joint damping is yet to be established. 
This paper documents a research effort at Utah State University 
to better understand joint damping in large space structures. A 
miniature tetrahedral truss was constructed which used pinned 
joints. A large tip mass was attached to the truss to lower the 
natural frequency to a range associated with the space station. 
Considerable ground testing has been conducted to characterize 
the damping of the truss in a 1-g environment in different 
orientations and in a vacuum. These experiments show that gravity 
can dramatically influence the damping produced. Author

Continuum modeling of large space structures is extended to

sensitivity equations for structures involving eigenfrequencies, 
modal masses, modal stiffnesses, and modal damping are 
presented. Matrix equations relating changes in element parameters

for the entire dynamical system are rearranged as a system of 
algebraic equations with unknowns of stiffness losses at selected

demonstrated on a simply-supported Euler-Bernouilli beam with 
simulated construction defects. The method is next extended to 
large space structures modelled as equivalent continua with

Research toward the eventual construction of large space

damage. The focus of this work is detection and location of damage 
in large truss structures. A method has been developed which 
incorporates system identification techniques using dynamic 
response measurements with a damage location algorithm to 
pinpoint deleted members of a truss. Various damage cases are 
examined in simulations with two truss structures: a planar truss 
and a three dimensional orthogonal tetrahedral truss similar to 
that proposed for the Space Station, The simulation results show 
that damage can be located by using the response of a large 
truss structure. However, damage in certain members is difficult 
or impossible to locate with limited available data. Author

An analysis technique and associated computer programs have 
been developed that predict the probability of no penetration of a

This technique accounts for the spacecraft's geometry, orientation, 
varying wall configuration and the varying density of the meteoroid 
and debris environment. Results are presented for a configuration 
similar to the proposed Space Station. These results show that 
the Space Station will require shields to obtain adequate safety 
levels. This shielding will be primarily designed by the debris threat. 
The results are sensitive to the environment definition and wall

To inhibit damage and limit the probability of penetration of 
the Space Station pressure wall by micrometeoroids and orbital 
debris, a shield placed away from the wall is used to form a 
double wall. To determine shield effectiveness and assess impact 
damage, existing test data were reviewed and additional testing 
was performed for Space Station double wall designs. Empirical 
spallation and penetration functions derived from the data show 
that shield thickness and impact angle affect the damage to the 
wall. Thick shields reduce wall damage for low angle impacts but 
increase damage for oblique impacts. Multilayer insulation between 
the shield and wall reduces impact damage to the wall. A 
relationship between impact velocity and spall damage to the wall 
is demonstrated. Preliminary test results on Li-AI shield material 
indicate possible improved effectiveness over Al shields. CD.

This paper presents the development and properties of

properties of the tubes were determined analytically and verified 
by tests. These properties were shown to be suitable for space 
structures that require high stiffness, low weight and thermal 
expansion, and dimensional stability during operational life. A 
special feature of the tubes is the ability to tune the tube for 
thermal expansion after fabrication by a chemical milling process. 
The tubes are also resistant to atomic oxygen and handling 
damage. The toughness of the tubes was demonstrated by impact 
testing. Cyclic thermal testing showed no adverse effects on the 
expansion and stiffness behavior of the tubes. The paper also 
includes a discussion of a joining method that uses aluminum end 
fittings and an efficient scarf joint configuration. Additional studies 
considered various adhesives and fitting materials. Joint allowables 
were higher for titanium and B4C particulate magnesium fittings. 
The effect of different adhesives under static loading conditions 
favored the high-strength adhesives. Author

The Space Station Reference Configuration is assembled in 
19 assembly flights of several large structure elements of varied 
size and shape that contribute to its overall asymmetrical nature. 
The elements include thousands of square feet of solar arrays 
and thermal radiators, several hundred feet of truss structure, and 
several hundred thousand pounds of large-diameter 
cylindrical-shaped pressure modules housing scientific experiments 
and astronaut habitation areas. This paper quantitatively describes 
these physical characteristics of the fully assembled Space Station 
configuration. Several flight control design considerations are 
discussed relating to control system sizing, flight-path attitude 
orientation, payload pointing accommodation, and potential 
configuration modifications. CD.

Space Station components are susceptible to hypervelocity 
impact damage from orbital debris and meteoroids. An especially 
vulnerable and critical space station component is the module 
pressure wall. Even with shielding, sufficiently large impacting 
particles can create penetrations ranging from pinholes to large 
jagged holes. This paper describes pressure wall damage repair 
patches along with procedures and tools for performing the repair. 
One patch incorporates an aluminum foil protected from the jagged 
hole edge with a Kevlar or foam pad. An adhesive holds the 
patch in place. Another patch uses a stiff plate held away from 
the damaged area by a low durrometer rubber ring which also 
seals the plate edge. An adhesive will also secure this patch in 
place. Procedures were developed to prepare the punctured wall 
surface and apply the patch under weightless and unpressurized 
conditions. The procedures were tested in a laboratory and in the 
MSEC Neutral Buoyancy Simulator with models of the patches 
and tools. Author

03 STRUCTURAL CONCEPTS 



This paper presents a recursive method to accomplish pole 
placement for control of large-order vibrating systems. The pole 
placement is based on matrix perturbation theory, where the 
controls are considered as a first-order perturbation on the 
uncontrolled system. The difference between the open-loop poles 
and the desired closed-loop poles is divided into regions small 
enough to maintain validity of the perturbation assumption. Control 
gains are then calculated in each region, resulting in a stepwise 
design. The method presented here is also applicable to any linear, 
time-invariant system. Author

moduli, the effectiveness of impact dampers for space applications, 
adaptive damping for spacecraft by temperature control, the

A modal coupling technique of a large system with complex 
storage moduli is presented in this paper. The natural modes of 
vibration of each substructure are calculated by fixing the interface 
degrees of freedom of that substructure. The motion of each 
substructure is then written with reference to the constraint modes 
and fixed constraint complex modes. A global transformation is 
then used to incorporate the common boundary degrees of freedom 
of two or more substructures leaving the fixed constraint 



generalized dynamic coordinates of each substructure intact. The 
technique is verified with a planar truss structure having 40 degrees 
of freedom. Author

Future Large Space Structures (LSSs) will require some means 
of vibration damping in order to meet system performance goals. 
The necessary vibration suppression may be achieved through a 
passive or active means or through a compined passive/active 
control approach. The Representative System Article (RSA), 
developed under the Air Force/Martin Marietta Passive and Active 
Control of Space Structures program, was designed as a generic 
LSS for analytic study of passive and active control approaches. 
A laboratory model of the RSA, referred to as the Dynamic Test 
Article (DTA), is being fabricated to demonstrate the design 
methods and performance of passive damping treatments and 
mechanisms. This paper presents the analytic and experimental 
test results for three DTA components on which modal surveys 
have been conducted. The results demonstrate that passive 
damping can be successfully designed and predicted in LSS-type 
structures using the modal strain energy method and viscoelastic 
materials. Author

The use of constitutive equations which involve generalized or 
fractional derivatives for the description and prediction of the time 
dependent behavior of materials of interest for damping applications 
is described. Such relationships, which have origins in observed 
tendencies towards power law behavior rather than exponential 
response, are shown to be effective descriptors of the dynamic 
behavior of real materials. Such models are shown to have a 
sound theoretical basis and to satisfy essential thermodynamic 
relationships. When used in structural analysis they lead to causal, 
analytic results. Examples of the use of such relationships to predict 
vibratory and creep responses are given. The models and 
associated techniques are suggested as being highly appropriate 
for use in predicting the transient motion of large space 
structures. Author

Structural tailoring provides an attractive method to optimize 
the performance of actively controlled space structures. However, 
the simultaneous optimization of control gains and structural 
properties often becomes prohibitively expensive for large systems 
and physical insight is often lost in the resulting control law. This 
paper presents a method for optimization of the closed loop 
structural system using only structural tailoring. Optimal Linear 
Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control theory is used with weighting 
matrices chosen based on physical considerations. The LOR 
control law depends only on two scalar gains and the structural 



properties. Hence, the closed loop-performance can be expressed 
in terms of the structural parameters. Results are given for a 
beam and a truss-beam to show the simplicity of the method and 
the importance of structural tailoring to increase dynamic 
performance and to reduce the control effort. Author

not superimpose nonlinear rigid body kinematics with linear 
structural mode shapes, an approach that has recently been shown 
to be grossly inaccurate under certain conditions. Instead, the 
finite element method is extended to treat large 
motions/deformations. The formulation is oriented toward joint 
dominated structures and places the generalized coordinates at 
the joints. For the planar spin-up of a flexible beam, results are 
compared with those derived from a commercially available 
computer program. The two programs predict nearly identical 
results. Author

The Rayleigh-Ritz method is a technique for approximating the 
eigensolution associated with a distributed structure. The method 
amounts to approximating the solution of a differential eigenvalue 
problem that has no known closed-form solution by a finite series 
of admissible function, thus replacing the differential eigenvalue 
problem by an algebraic eigenvalue problem. The finite element 
method can be regarded as a Rayleigh-Ritz method, at least for 
structures. The main difference between the finite element method 
and the classical Rayleigh-Ritz method lies in the nature of the

admissible functions. An important question in both the classical 
Rayleigh-Ritz method and the finite element method is the speed 
of convergence. It is demonstrated in this paper that convergence 
of the classical Rayleigh-Ritz method can be vastly improved by 
introducing a new class of admissible functions, called 
quasi-comparison functions. Factors affecting the convergence of 
the finite element method are also discussed. Author

Active vibration suppression of a large flexible space structure 
has been studied extensively in recent years. The studies include 
reduced-order modeling of structures with associated controller 
design. The main objectives of active control design are minimizing 
hardware and real-time computation while achieving efficient and 
robust control of the structure. Structure modeling and various 
control techniques are briefly discussed in this paper. Control 
designs based on state variable feedback are compared with an 
energy dissipation-based design. The effect of nonlinearities is 
considered by allowing saturation of the actuator control. The 
control design is experimentally implemented and compared with 
the numerical simulation. Critical issues related to experimental 
implementation are discussed. The energy dissipation control 
design is shown to be superior to others in tight of the 
above-mentioned objectives. Author

The vibration control of truss structures has attracted increasing 
attention due to their possible use in space applications such as 
Space Station structures. Since the members of truss structures 
are subjected to axial force, a concept of vibration control by the 
use of axial force actuators is expected to give a new feature on 
vibration control of truss structures compared with the conventional 
external force control. The effectiveness of the concept is 



demonstrated through the numerical simulation of simple 
two-dimensional truss beam, the model experiment of beam 
structure, and the corresponding simulation of experimental beam 
model. Author

Pulse propagations in large space structures caused by repeated 
pulse excitations are studied analytically (by using the Z-transforms) 
and numerically. It is found that resonance regimes can be 
generated not only by periodical, but also by non-periodical 
repeated pulses; the conditions for such regimes are derived. 
Special attention is paid to the dispersion of propagating pulses 
due to structural irregularities, to damping of pulses due to 
appropriate combination of elastic and viscous properties of joints 
between structural members, and to the protection of certain areas 
of Large Space Structures (LSS) from impacts provided by a pulse 
trapping effect. Author

The subject of this study is the structural implementation of a 
large parabolic space antenna in the form of a wire mesh. Being 
an underconstrained structural system, a wire mesh is inherently 
shapeless, with any particular geometirc configuration being a 
function of the applied load. This feature entails ultimate ease of 
control; geometric reconfiguration of the system can be purely 
kinematic (i.e., it does not have to involve elastic deformations). 
This work is an initial assessment of the kinematic reconfiguration 
of a thermally distorted wire mesh reflector, and of the efficiency 
of resulting reflector surfaces. Typical thermal patterns are applied, 
and the resulting changes in member lengths are calculated to 
serve as inputs to the procedure. The developed technique for 
optical kinematic reconfiguration employs mean-square distortion.

The primary goal of parametric studies performed was to evaluate 
the efficiency of reconfiguration in relation to the mesh fineness. 
The results look promising and confirm the viability of the concept 
of statically controlled geometry in underconstrained structural 
systems. Author

The multiple boundary condition test (MBCT) approach is a 
ground test method to test a class of large flexible structures 
which cannot be ground tested by state-of-the-art test methods 
due to the adverse terrestrial environment. The ultimate objective 
of a ground test is considered to be the validation and update of 
a mathematical model of the structure. The research to date has 
indicated the MBCT does work on numerical simulations and on 
experimental laboratory hardware. To date only the eigenvalue 
has been used in the model correlation/update by inclusion of 
the information in the nonlinear terms resulting from the difference 
between the analytical and measured eigenvectors. This paper 
presents the results of utilizing additional information, namely the 
difference in the analytical and the test eigenvectors, in the 
validation and update of the mathematical model. Author

An identification procedure to improve the mass weighted 
orthogonality of measured mode shapes is introduced. The 
procedure takes into account the degree of mode isolation present 
during measurement. This is accomplished by establishing a set 
of new mode shapes, from the measured vectors, that satisfy 
cross-orthogonatity constraints and are a minimum deviation from 
the measured data. A significant feature is that each measured 
mode, from which improved modes are identified, can be 
established using different excitation locations and force levels. 
This allows the procedure to improve the isolation of modes 
measured with multishaker, sine dwell testing techniques. Author

Methods to generalize modal response analysis for the case 
of linear time-varying mechanical systems are developed and 
compared with regard to accuracy, reliability, and ease of 
implementation. Previous attempts to use modal methods for these 
systems have failed to include various terms due to time-variation 
In the eigenvectors; these terms are in fact negligible only under 
the very restrictive assumption that the system configuration varies 
quasi-statically. The methods developed here preserve all 
time-varying characteristics of the modal transformation, and 
therefore represent completely general approaches to the analysis 
of linear time-varying mechanical systems. Author

A graphical tool is developed and validated for the verification 
and updating of large structure finite element models (FEM) for 
better correlation with modal test data. The elaborated Linear 
Quadratic Optimization (LQO) theory consists of a linearization 
and solution of the conventional matrix optimization problem which 
respects the connectivity of the structure and the symmetry of 
the stiffness matrix. The LQO theory is validated through a 
numerical and experimental sensitivity analysis. The results 
demonstrate the ability of the LQO algorithm to identify the regions 
of the structure and update the stiffness coefficients associated 
with the inappropriately modeled load paths. Author

This paper presents a distributed parameter estimation scheme 
for flexible structures and investigates its computational merit for 
three generic problems. The distributed nature of the structure is 
retained throughout the development of the algorithm and a 
finite-element approximation is used only to implement the 
algorithm. This approach eliminates many problems associated 
with model truncation used in other methods of identification. The 
identification problem is formulated in infinite-dimensional spaces 
and an optimal control technique Is used to minimize weighted 
least squares of error between the actual and the model data. 
Computer simulation studies are conducted using flexible beam 
models as examples. Numerical results show a close match 
between the estimated and true values of the parameters.

ANALYSIS OF OBLIQUE HYPERVELOCITY IMPACT

This paper describes the results of an experimental investigation 
of phenomena associated with the oblique hypervelocity impact 
of spherical projectiles on multisheet aluminum structures. A model 
that can be employed in the design of meteoroid and space debris 
protection systems for space structures is developed. The model 
consists of equations that relate crater and perforation damage of 
a multisheet structure to parameters such as projectile size, impact 
velocity, and trajectory obliquity. The equations are obtained 
through a regression analysis of oblique hypervelocity impact test 
data. This data shows that the response of a multisheet structure 
to oblique impact is significantly different from its response to 
normal hypervelocity impact. It was found that obliquely incident 
projectiles produce ricochet debris that can severely damage panels 
or instrumentation located on the exterior of a space structure.

Obliquity effects of high-speed impact must, therefore, be

The linearization method presented for calculating the transient 
responses of nonlinear systems due to initial disturbances is an 
extension of the 'describing function' approach, in which the 
system's steady-state response is calculated by representing such 
nonlinear elements as space structure joints with impedances that 
are functions of response amplitude. It is shown that, for the 
transient case, the steady-state impedances can be averaged over 
the range of responses in order to furnish equivalent values of 
stiffness and damping; these, for a given set of initial displacements, 
may be treated as constant during calculations of system 
response. O.C.

(AIAA PAPER 88-2411) 

The accuracy of component mode synthesis is investigated 
experimentally for substructures coupled by nonideal joints. The 
work is based upon a segmented experimental beam for which 
free-intertace frequency response matrices are measured for each 
segment. These measurements are used directly in component 
mode synthesis to predict the behavior of the assembled structure; 
the segments are then physically joined, and the resulting frequency 
response of the superstructure is compared to the prediction. 
Rotational freeplay is then introduced into the connecting joint, 
and the new superstructure frequency response is compared to 
the original linear component mode synthesis prediction. The level 
of accuracy to be expected in component mode synthesis is 
discussed in terms of the degree of nonlinearity in the joints, 
mode number, and mode shapes. Author

This paper examines the performance of the recursive least 
squares (RLS) algorithm and a derivative, the recursive lattice 
least squares (RLLS) algorithm in matching a linear model to a 
simple nonlinear model. The response of a single degree of 
freedom mass-spring-dashpot system to continuous forcing is 
simulated, and estimates for the modal parameters are obtained. 
Nonlinearity is introduced by allowing the restoring spring to slide 
without friction in a gap of specified width. Such a nonlinearity is 
of interest since it is a simple model of the effect of loose joints 
in a deployable spacecraft structure. The RLS algorithm is found 
to be the most reliable. Author

The advantages and disadvantages of various techniques of 
model order reduction for large space structure applications are 
discussed. Condensation methods such as the Guyan (1965) 
reduction basically reduce the order of the original large 
dimensional linear model by discarding some of the modal 
deflections called 'slave' degrees-of-freedom and retaining the 
remaining 'master' degrees-of-freedom. Other techniques 
considered include aggregation methods, the cost decomposition 
method, the balanced state-space representation, and optimal 
projection methods. An approach for generating optimal reduced 
order models for large-scale systems based on an appropriate 
performance index is presented. R.R.

The analysis code BUMPER executes a numerical solution to 
the problem of calculating the probability of no penetration (PNP) 
of a spacecraft subject to man-made orbital debris or meteoroid 
impact. The codes were developed on a DEC VAX 11/780 
computer that uses the Virtual Memory System (VMS) operating 
system, which is written in FORTRAN 77 with no VAX extensions. 
To help illustrate the steps involved, a single sample analysis is 
performed. The example used is the space station reference 
configuration. The finite element model (FEM) of this configuration 
is relatively complex but demonstrates many BUMPER features. 
The computer tools and guidelines are described for constructing 
a FEM for the space station under consideration. The methods 
used to analyze the sensitivity of PNP to variations in design, are 
described. Ways are suggested for developing contour plots of 
the sensitivity study data. Additional BUMPER analysis examples 
are provided, including FEMs, command inputs, and data outputs. 
The mathematical theory used as the basis for the code is 
described, and illustrates the data flow within the analysis. B.G.

The appropriateness of the selection of four issues (advanced 
materials development, analysis/design methods, tests of large 
flexible structures, and structural concepts) was evaluated. A 
cross-check of the issues and their relationship to the technology 
drivers is presented. Although all of the issues addressed numerous 
drivers, the advanced materials development issue impacts six 
out of the seven drivers and is considered to be the most crucial. 
The advanced materials technology development and the advanced 
design/analysis methods development were determined to be 
enabling technologies with the testing issues and development of 
structural concepts considered to be of great importance, although 
not enabling technologies. In addition, and of more general interest 
and criticality, the need for a Government/ Industry commitment 
which does not now exist, was established. This commitment would 
call for the establishment of the required infrastructure to facilitate 
the development of the capabilities highlighted through the

System identification of the space station dynamic model will 
require flight data from a finite number of judiciously placed sensors 



on it. The placement of structural dynamics sensors on the space 
station is a particularly challenging problem because the station 
will not be deployed in a single mission. Given that the build-up 
sequence and the final configuration for the space station are 
currently undetermined, a procedure for sensor placement was 
developed using the assembly flights 1 to 7 of the rephased dual 
keel space station as an example. The procedure presented 
approaches the problem of placing the sensors from an 
engineering, as opposed to a mathematical, point of view. In 
addition to locating a finite number of sensors, the procedure 
addresses the issues of unobserved structural modes, dominant 
structural modes, and the trade-offs involved in sensor placement 
for space station. This procedure for sensor placement will be 
applied to revised, and potentially more detailed, finite element 
models of the space station configuration and assembly 
sequence. Author

The composite materials proposed for use in the Advanced 
Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) Program contains a 
new, high modulus graphite fiber as the reinforcement. A study 
was conducted to measure certain mechanical properties of the 
new fiber-reinforced material as well as of a composite-faced 
aluminum honeycomb sandwich structure. Properties were 
measured at -157, 22, and 121 C. Complete characterization of 
this material was not intended. Longitudinal tensile, picture-frame 
shear, short-beam shear, and flexural tests were performed on 
specimens of the composite face-sheet materials. Unidirectional, 
cross-plied, and quasi-isotropic fiber composite ply layup designs 
were fabricated and tested. These designs had been studied by 
using NASA's Integrated Composite Analyzer (ICAN) computer 
program. Flexural tests were conducted on {a-/- 60/0 deg) sub s 
composite-faced sandwich structure material. Resistance strain 
gages were used to measure strains in the tensile, picture-frame, 
and sandwich flexural tests. The sandwich flexural strength was 
limited by the core strength at -1 57 and 22 C. The adhesive bond 
strength was the limiting factor at 121 C. Adhesive mechanical 
properties are reflected in sandwich structure flexural properties 
when the span-to-depth ratio is great enough to allow a significant 
shear effect on the load-deflection behavior of the sandwich beam. 
Most measured properties agreed satisfactorily with the properties 
predicted by ICAN. Author

Two matrix correction methods are evaluated using a simple 
beam and a simple plate structure. Experimental data are obtained 
for the plate with an impact test and simulated in case of the 
beam. The structures were modelled with MSC/NASTRAN. To 
facilitate the comparison the Guyan reduction method was applied 
to calculate the natural frequencies and normal modes, and the 
position of the excitation points used in the tests coincide with 
the ASET. Both updating methods were programmed in DMAP. 
The results of the finite element calculation are obtained from the 
(old) problem tape and the experimental date are brought into the 
DMAP by bulk data cards. It is concluded that within 
MSC/NASTRAN the DMAP programming is a convenient facility 
to use for matrix correction methods. To guarantee the physical 
relevance of the updated matrices, the update methods have to 
be used with correlation methods. ESA

Several items were found to be of immense value in the design 
and development of the Assembly Concept for Construction of 
Erectable Space Structures (ACCESS) hardware. The early 
availability of mock-up and engineering test hardware helped to 
develop the concept and prove the feasibility of the experiment. 
The extensive neutral buoyancy testing was invaluable in 
developing the procedures and timelines, proving that the hardware 
functioned as intended, and effectively trained the astronauts. The 
early involvement of the crew systems/astronaut personnel was 
extremely beneficial in shaping the design to meet the EVA 
compatibility requirements. Also, the early definition of coupled 
loads and on-orbit dynamic responses can not be overemphasized 
due to the relative uncertainty in the magnitude of these loads 
and their impact on the design. Author

The Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Payload Management and 
Operations Directorate is responsible for the processing of Space 
Shuttle payloads. The KSC responsibilities begin prior to hardware 
arrival at the launch site and extend until the experiments are 
returned to the investigators after the flight. The KSC involvement 
with the integration and checkout of payloads begins with 
participation in experiment. Mission Peculiar Equipment (MPE), and 
integrated payload design reviews. This involvement also includes 
participation in assembly and testing of flight hardware at the 
appropriate design center, university, or private corporation. Once 
the hardware arrives at the launch site, KSC personnel install the 
experiments and MPE onto a carrier in the Operations and 
Checkout (O & C) building. Following integration, the payload is 
functionally tested and then installed into the orbiter. After the 
mission, the payload is removed from the orbiter, deintegrated in 



the O & C building, and the experiments are turned over to the 
mission manager. One of the many payloads process at KSC 
consisted of two space construction experiments: the Experimental 
Assembly of Structures in Extravehicular Activity (EASE) and the 
Assembly Concept for Construction of Erectable Space Structures

All basic EVA space construction tasks included in the 
experiment were accomplished on-orbit successfully, and the 
construction task time shows good correlation with neutral 
buoyancy data. However, the flight assembly times were slightly 
longer than the best times obtained in the water tank. This result 
was attributed by the EVA astronauts to the new, tighter tolerance 
truss hardware used on-orbit as opposed to the well-worn training 
hardware used in the neutral buoyancy and was, thus, not a space 
related phenomenon. The baseline experiment demonstrated that 
erectable structure can be assembled effectively by astronauts in 
EVA. The success of ACCESS confirmed the feasibility of EVA 
space assembly of erectable trusses and played a role in the 
decision to baseline the Space Station as a 5 meter erectable 
structure. Author

Summary of major research findings in three topical areas: 1) 
traveling wave concepts in the dynamics and control of Large 
Space Structures, 2) passive damping in Large Space Structures 
Applications, and 3) active control of rigid and flexible Manipulator 
Arms. The traveling wave concepts for characterizing the dynamics 
of flexible structures have introduced an alternative to modal 
synthesis and established a basis for the development of new 
controls algorithms. Passive damping studies identified various 
types of damping mechanisms including thermoelastic, and 
electromagnetic, and quantified their relative contributions. The 
active control studies generated a number of algorithms and control

On-orbit manufacture of lightweight, high-strength, 
advanced-composite structures using the pultrusion process is 
proposed. This process is adaptable to a zero-gravity environment 
by using preimpregnated graphite-fiber reinforcement systems. The 
reinforcement material is preimpregnated with a high-performance 
thermoplastic resin at a ground station, is coiled on spools for 
compact storage, and is transported into Earth orbit. A pultrusion 
machine is installed in the Shuttle cargo bay from which very 
long lengths of the desired structure is fabricated on-orbit. Potential 
structural profiles include rods, angles, channels, hat sections, 
tubes, honeycomb-cored panels, and T, H, and I beams. A potential 
pultrudable thermoplastic/graphite composite material is presented 
as a model for determining the effect on Earth-to-orbit package 
density of an on-orbit manufacture, the package density is increased 
by 132 percent, and payload volume requirement is decreased by 
56.3 percent. The fabrication method has the potential for on-orbit 
manufacture of structural members for space platforms, large space 
antennas, and long tethers. Author

A method for simultaneous structural and control design of 
large flexible space structures (LFSS) to reduce vibration gerierated 
by disturbances is presented. Desired natural frequencies and 
damping ratios for the closed loop system are achieved by using 
a combination of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) synthesis and 
numerical optimization techniques. The state and control weighing 
matrices (Q and R) are expressed in terms of structural parameters 
such as mass and stiffness. The design parameters are selected 
by numerical optimization so as to minimize the weight of the 
structure and to achieve the desired closed-loop eigenvalues. An 
illustrative example of the design of a two bar truss is presented.

A technique to provide modal vibration damping in high 
performance space structures was developed which uses less than 
one once of incompressible fluid. Up to 50 percent damping can 
be achieved which can reduce the settling times of the lowest 
structural mode by as much as 50 to 1. This concept allows the 
designers to reduce the weight of the structure while improving 
its dynamic performance. Damping by this technique is purely 
viscous and has been shown by test to be linear over 5 orders of 
input magnitude. Amplitudes as low as 0.2 microinch were 
demonstrated. Damping in the system is independent of stiffness 
and relatively insensitive to temperature. Author

(a) two-dimensional cable-suspended rigid bars on a flexible center

Future exploration and enterprise in low-Earth orbit will most 
likely require space stations for support. In addition, promotion of 
the Strategic Defense Initiative is mandating research and 
development into technologies for building structures to serve 
military objectives in space. However, an assessment of the state 
of the art for space construction technology has revealed that the 
field is immature, with little conceptual and experimental research 
completed. The U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research 
Laboratory (USA-CERL) has collected information on existing 
technologies for possible application in designing large space 
structures (LSS) for military support. This work is part of an effort 
to ensure mission-responsiveness in anticipation of a role in space 
construction. Military structures will require design criteria much 
different from those of experimental space stations. Proposed 
conceptual criteria for both types of structures are compared and 
differences are noted. Much R and D is needed before any of 
these structures can be developed in space. To serve as 
background for future studies, a literature critique is included in 
this report. GRA

In a previous report, transfer matrices and joint coupling 
matrices are used to compute natural frequencies of vibration of 
a five-bay planar lattice structure. In this report, the problem of 
detecting damage in the five-bay planar lattice structure is 
considered. Seven different states of damage are assumed. Each 
damage state corresponds to a disconnected or partially 
disconnected joint in the lattice. Transfer matrices and joint coupling 
matrices are used to compute natural frequencies associated with 
each damage state. The natural frequencies computed for each 
damage state are significantly different from the natural frequencies 
of the undamaged lattice; for example, the frequencies of the first 
flexible mode of the damaged lattice are 26 to 83 percent lower 
than the frequency of the first flexible node of the undamaged 



lattice. The results presented here demonstrate that measurement 
of natural frequencies is a potentially useful method for detecting 
damage in lattice structures, at least, for the types of damage 
considered here. However, it is also shown here that measurement 
of natural frequencies alone is not sufficient, in general, to 
determine the location of damage within the lattice structure. Thus, 
measurement of natural frequencies should be regarded as only 
a part of a complete nondestructive evaluation method. After the 
results obtained here are presented, some suggestions for NDE 
methods which may be capable of providing more quantitative 
measures of structural integrity. GRA

Wave propagation characteristics of large space structures

propagation characteristics of an aluminum 22-bay planar lattice 
structure are determined experimentally. Two ultrasonic 
piezoceramic longitudinal transducers are mounted at various 
locations on the structure. Wave measurements are obtained by 
injecting an impulsive load via the transmitting transducer and 
recording the response via the receiving transducer. The waves 
injected into the structure are longitudinal waves, transverse to 
the surface, although a complex stress distribution which may be 
described by directivity functions is actually realized. The impulsive 
loading signal has a broad frequency spectrum containing 
frequencies greater than 0.5MHz. GRA

A mathematical model is developed to predict the dynamics 
of the proposed orbiting Spacecraft Control Laboratory Experiment

are derived using a Newton-Euler formulation. The model includes 
the effects of gravity, flexibility, and orbital dynamics. The control 
is assumed to be provided to the system through the Shuttle's 
three torquers, and through six actuators located by pairs at two 
points on the mast and at the mass center of the reflector. The 
modal shape functions are derived using the fourth order beam 
equation. The generic mode equations are derived to account for

the effects of the control forces on the modal shape and 
frequencies. The equations are linearized about a nominal 
equilibrium position. The linear regulator theory is used to derive 
control laws for both the linear model of the rigidized SCOLE as 
well as that of the actual SCOLE including the first four flexible 
modes. The control strategy previously derived for the linear model 
of the rigidized SCOLE is applied to the nonlinear model of the 
same configuration of the system and preliminary single axis 
slewing maneuvers conducted. The results obtained confirm the 
applicability of the intuitive and appealing two-stage control strategy 
which would slew the SCOLE system, as if rigid to its desired 
position and then concentrate on damping out the residual flexible 
motions. Author

in structure and to model reduction. The second type is the 
sensitivity of the optimum design of the control system to changes 
in the structure. This sensitivity is of interest in assessing the 
need for integrated structure/control design. Three direct rate 
feedback control techniques are studied for a laboratory structure 
which has characteristics of LSS and then compared to standard 
linear quadratic control. The baseline design of each control system 
is obtained first and then sensitivity analysis conducted.

The procedures and results of a study of a conceptual system 
for measuring the debris environment on the space station is 
discussed. The study was conducted in two phases: the first 
consisted of experiments aimed at evaluating location of impact 
through panel response data collected from acoustic emission 
sensors; the second analyzed the available statistical description 
of the environment to determine the probability of the measurement 
system producing useful data, and analyzed the results of the 
previous tests to evaluate the accuracy of location and the feasibility 
of extracting impactor characteristics from the panel response. 
The conclusions were that for one panel the system would not be 
exposed to any event, but that the entire Logistics Module would 
provide a modest amount of data. The use of sensors with higher 
sensitivity than those used in the tests could be advantageous. 
The impact location could be found with sufficient accuracy from 
panel response data. The waveforms of the response were shown 
to contain information on the impact characteristics, but the data 
set did not span a sufficient range of the variables necessary to 
evaluate the feasibility of extracting the information. Author

A comparative study of the simulation algorithms for dynamics 
of large space structures modeled as a collection of rigid 
multibodies connected by hinges is described. Two algorithms have 
been independently developed at two research institutes. One 
method is based upon the well-known Euler Newton formulation 
and the unified matrix approach. The unified matrix approach solves 
the dynamical equation for the derivatives of the non-holonomic 
velocities and the internal torques and forces simultaneously, hence 
permitting us to deal with an arbitrary large space structure (LSS) 
configuration. The other method provides for an efficient and fast 
algorithm based on Kane's method with modification in the inertia 
dyadic and other quantities. Both methods have been applied to 
two typical examples: the first is a satellite with four-link manipulator 
as a model of a chain structure, and the second is a satellite with 
a closed loop deployment mechanism. The results coincide 
satisfactorily and the validity of the two methods has been proven 
perfectly. The numerical values given in this report will be useful 
as a reference in other simulations. Author

This document considers the problem of control of a beam 
which is moving in the x-y plane. It extends from x=0 to x=L. 
The left end at x=0 is clamped to an actuator which moves the 
beam along the v-axis. The control input is the force u(t) in y 
direction. While moving, the beam may vibrate. Let z(t) denote 
the displacement of the left from y=0, and w(t,x), the displacement 
of the beam from the line y=z(t) at position x and time t. Suppose 
a position sensor is placed on the beam and the sensing output 
is v(t, sub 0)=z(t) + w(t,xO), where less than x sub less than

03 STRUCTURAL CONCEPTS 



L is the sensor location. We are interested in the case when the 
flexure w{t,x) of the beam is significant. The problem is to synthesize 
a feedback control law which moves the beam from one position 
to another in a stable manner. It is welt known that when the 
sensor and the actuator are colocated a simple lead compensator 
suffices to produce a stable design. This result holds even when 
the beam dynamics are considered as a system with infinite 
zero-damping modes, and can be shown using root locus argument. 
This stabilization method may break down, however, when there 
is a positional gap between the sensor and actuator. In this case 
the classical compensation techniques are no longer effective. 
Time-domain optimization approaches based on state-space 
models have been applied to this problem. This article presents a 
case study of noncolocated beam control problem using 
frequency-domain optimization method proposed by Professor 
Kwakerna. GRA

An Extendable and Retractable Mast (ERM) for space 
applications such as deployment and retraction of high power 
rollable, foldable, or rigid solar arrays, large unfurtable antennas, 
and scientific payloads, was developed. The coverage of a large 
field of application requires a strong and stiff light-weight mast 
with good pointing accuracy allowing the adaptation of heavy tip 
masses as well as the fixation of line-loads to intermediate 
attachment points along the mast at the same time. The ERM 
payload capability is 40 kg on tip, plus 10 kg/m line load, plus 
100N eccentric load. Deployed length is 40 m. The ERM is designed 
as a spindle-driven telescopic mast in carbon-fiber reinforced 
plastics (CFRP) technology. A 40 m solar array mast and a 20 m 
antenna mast were considered. The feasibility of a 60 m mast is 
also shown. Manufacturing and test of a breadboard model 
hardware, and the detailed design of an engineering model mast 
are described. ESA

Future exploration and enterprise in low-Earth orbit will most 
likely require space stations for support. In addition, promotion of 
the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) is mandating research and 
development (R and D) into technologies for building structures 
to serve military objectives in space. However, an assessment of 
the state of the art for space construction technology has revealed 
that the field is immature, with little conceptual and experimental 
research completed. The U.S. Army Construction Engineering 
Research Laboratory (USA-CERL) has collected information on 
existing technologies for possible application in designing large 
space structures (LSS) for military support. This work is part of 
an effort by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to ensure 
mission-responsiveness in anticipation of a role in space 
construction. USA-CERL is USAGE'S designated lead laboratory 
for this program. Military structures will require design criteria much 
different from those of experimental space stations. Proposed 
conceptual criteria for both types structures are compared and 
differences are noted. Much R and D is needed before any of 
these structures can be deployed in space. GRA

A fin-stiffened strut concept which possesses high bending 
stiffness and low packaged volume has been identified for use on 
large space structures. The concept incorporates three curved 
fins which deploy from a core tube to increase the effective 
cross-sectional moment of inertia, the buckling load, and the 
vibration frequency of the strut. A strut design incorporating welded 
fin connections provides an upper bound of the strut buckling 
load. A strut design which allows the individual fins and core to 
move independently in the strut axial direction provides a lower 
bound of the strut buckling load which is approximately 20 to 25 
percent of the upper bound. A practical strut design, incorporating 
hinge assemblies which constrain the fins to move together but 
independently of the core tube in the strut axial direction, provides 
a buckling load which is 75 to 80 percent of the upper bound. 
Euler's equation can be used to accurately predict buckling loads 
for the bounding designs. Flat plate finite element models of all 
designs give results that agree to within 10 percent of the 
experimental values. Equivalent beam models of the strut give 
results which are slightly less accurate. Author

The Mast Material Test Program (MAMATEP) at NASA Lewis 
is discussed. Objectives include verifying the need for, and 
evaluating the performance of, various protection techniques for 
the Solar Array Assembly mast of the Space Station Photovoltaic 
Power Module. Mast material samples were evaluated in terms of 
mass and bending modulus, measured before and after 
environmental exposure. Test environments included atomic 
oxygen exposure (RF plasma asher). thermal cycling, and 
mechanical flexing. Protective coatings included CV-1144 silicon, 
a Ni/Au/lnSn eutectic, and an open weave, Al braid. Results 
indicate that unprotected samples degrade in an atomic oxygen 
environment at a steady rate. Open weave, Al braid offers little 
protection for the fiberglass-epoxy sample in an asher environment. 
Ni/Au/lnSn eutectic offers excellent protection in an asher 
environment prior to thermal cycling and mechanical flexing. Long 
duration asher results from unprotected samples indicate that, even 
though the fiberglass-epoxy degrades, a protection technique may 
not be necessary to ensure structural integrity. However, a 
protection technique may be desirable to limit or contain the amount 
of debris generated by the degradation of the fiberglass-epoxy.

An integrated thermal energy storage (TES) system, developed 
as a part of an organic Rankine cycle solar dynamic power system 
is described, and the results of the performance verification tests 
of this TES system are presented. The integrated system consists 
of potassium heat-pipe elements that incorporate TES canisters 
within the vapor space, along with an organic fluid heater tube 
used as the condenser region of the heat pipe. The heat pipe 
assembly was operated through the range of design conditions 
from the nominal design input of 4.8 kW to a maximum of 5.7 
kW. The performance verification tests show that the system meets 
the functional requirements of absorbing the solar energy reflected 
by the concentrator, transporting the energy to the organic Rankine 
heater, providing thermal storage for the eclipse phase, and 
allowing uniform discharge from the thermal storage to the 
heater. I.S.

Multicomponent fluoride salt mixtures were characterized for

solar dynamic space power systems with operating temperatures 
in the range of 973 to 1400 K. The melting points and eutectic 
composition for many systems with published phase diagrams were 
verified, and several new eutectic compositions were identified. 
Additionally, the heats of fusion of several binary and ternary 
eutectics and congruently melting intermediate compounds were 
measured by differential scanning calorimetry. The extent of 
corrosion of various metals by fluoride melts was estimated from 
thermodynamic considerations, and equilibrium conditions inside a 
containment vessel were calculated as functions of the initial 
moisture content of the salt and free volume above the molten 
salt Preliminary experimental data on the corrosion of commercial, 
high-temperature alloys in LiF-19.5CaF2 and NaF-27CaF2-36MgF2

Five concepts for heat rejection devices for space power

moving-belt radiators, (3) Curie-point radiators, (4) rotating bubble 
membrane radiators, and (5) pump-loop and heat-pipe radiators. 
The concepts were compared for specific weight, stowable radiator 
area, launch capability, system integration, maneuverability, nuclear 
shielding, and survivability from natural and hostile threats. It is 
concluded that no one radiator system may best meet all 
requirements of all power systems; for each space power system 
a radiator system must be selected, which best satisfies the 
particularly weighted set of application criteria that apply to the 
mission, launch capability, power system, and platform components. 
It is noted that the present emphasis on specific weight may be 
misplaced. Geometric factors and deployability represent equally

The capillary power limit encountered in long heat pipes for 
high-power, high-temperature heat rejection by radiation to space 
may be exceeded by incorporating external electromagnetic force 
pumps for enhanced liquid return. The hydrodynamic performance 



of capillary pumped heat pipes Is compared with externally pumped 
heat pipes. Practical problems incurred with pump utilization are 
discussed. It is concluded that heat pipe radiator performance 
could be enhanced through external pumping under certain 
conditions, but, in general, power throughput requirements could 
be more readily achieved by other design changes. Pump 
implementation problems, including the required additional mass 
of the pumps, increased required radiator surface area for pump 
attachment, pump control requirements and pump power supply, 
are also discussed and evaluated. Author

Bode plots of singular values vs. frequency were used to design 
several types of controllers for the Space Station common module 
Thermal Control System. Several controllers were designed, 
including a classical lead control loop with a multivariable 
disturbuance input, and a multivariable output feedback controller. 
Singular value information was used to impose a hierarchical 
structure on the controller even though this structure was not 
natural to the plant; this permitted the design of local controllers 
with specified compensator structures; no undesirable additional 
dynamics in the form of observers or Kalman filters was needed. 
In addition, a method using singular values based on plant 
parameter variations was used to avoid gain scheduling. B.J.

A computer code to model the steady-state performance of a 
monogroove heat pipe for the NASA Space Station is presented, 
including the effects on heat pipe performance of a screen in the 
evaporator section which deals with transient surges in the heat 
input. Errors in a previous code have been corrected, and the 
new code adds additional loss terms in order to model several 
different working fluids. Good agreement with existing performance 
curves is obtained. From a preliminary evaluation of several of 
the radiator design parameters it is found that an optimum fin 
width could be achieved but that structural considerations limit 
the thickness of the fin to a value above optimum. R.R.

This paper studies the radiation characteristics of offset radial 
rib reflector antennas. Consideration is given to the mathematical 
description of the reflector surface, phase error characterization, 
and the features of the radiation patterns. It is shown that the 
copolar pattern of an offset radial rib reflector is closely related to 
that of an axisymmetric radial rib reflector with a slighly scaled 
focal length. The qualitative effects of varying the diameter, the 
number of ribs, or the focal length on the pattern of a radial rib 
reflector are described. I.S.

The Interactive Thermal Design System (ITDS) is a new 
computer program developed specifically to support design and 
analysis of advanced spacecraft Active Thermal Control 
Subsystems (ATCSs). The program was developed for NASA/JSC 
during 1985 and 1986 to provide design and analytical support 
needed for projects such as the Space Station and space platforms. 
ITDS uses modern computing techniques, VAX computing 
machinery, and commercial database and graphics software to 
greatly improve the productivity of design and analytical efforts. 
The program uses interactive menus to control technical and 
supporting functions combined with graphical system representation 
to streamline the design and analysis process. The ITDS library 
of single and two-phase ATCS routines accommodates design 
and analysis of single components or integrated systems. 
Supporting utilities provide units conversion, easily selected and 
accessed fluid property data for twenty ATCS fluids, and help 
data to assist the user with program functions. This paper describes 
the development of ITDS, the features it offers and examples of 
how it may be employed. Author

Future large spacecraft such as the Space Station will have 
high power dissipations and long heat transport distances. The 
combination of these two requirements dictate the need for a 
new heat transport technology. NASA-JSC has developed the 
concept of a two phase thermal bus in which the working fluid is 
evaporated at the heat collection site and is condensed at the 
heat rejection site. This provides a nearly isothermal system at 
lower pumping powers than current single phase systems. Boeing 
has developed a two-phase thermal bus testbed using ammonia 
working fluid. This testbed uses a Sundstrand rotary fluid 
management device (RFMD) to provide fluid pumping and 
liquid-vapor phase management. Overall heat transport capacity 
is 25 kW. This internally funded testbed is being used for thermal 
bus heat exchanger characterization and critical component life 
tests in an ammonia environment. Currently, the testbed has been 
assembled, proof-pressure tested, leak tested, and checked out. 
Heat exchanger performance tests are undenway. Author

Past space suits and the current Shuttle suit, which are 
constructed primarily from fabric, use the Integrated Thermal and 
Micrometeoroid Garment, which insulates the astronaut from his 
environment. The new generation of hard suits affords designers 
the opportunity to incorporate thermal control into the suit structure. 
Environmental influence on the suit temperature and heat flux 
can then be minimized with a high reflectance coating. Candidate 
coatings have been identified and ranked on the basis of 
thermophysical properties; wear, corrosion and atomic oxygen 
degradation resistance; and coating process and cost. Laboratory 
determination of properties, thermal cycling and wear resistance 
tests are underway to identify the optimum coating. A computer 
model is being developed to evaluate various environmental 
configurations. Preliminary results are presented here. Author

The feasibility of two-phase heat transport systems for use on 
Space Station was demonstrated by testing the Thermal Bus 
Technology Demonstrator (TBTD) as part of the Integrated 
Two-Phase System Test in NASA-JSC's Thermal Test Bed. Under 
contract to NASA-JSC, Grumman is currently developing the 
successor to the TBTD. the Prototype Thermal Bus System (TBS). 
The TBS design, which uses ammonia as the working fluid, is 
intended to achieve a higher fidelity level than the TBTD by 
incorporating both improvements based on TBTD testing and 
realistic design margins, and by addressing Space Station issues 
such as redundancy and maintenance. The TBS is currently being 
fabricated, with testing scheduled for late 1987/early 1988. This 
paper describes the TBS design which features fully redundant 
plumbing loops, five evaporators designed to represent different 
heat acquisition interfaces, 1 4 condensers which mate with either

Consideration has been given to utilizing the external area of 
the Space Station common modules or resource nodes to provide 
heat rejection. A program was undertaken to define the best body 
mounted radiator design, to define and build a full size test article 
and to conduct testing to verify performance. Trade studies were 
conducted and a preferred design selected. The selected design 
employed high performance grooved heat pipes of an off-the-shelf 
design. Twenty panels, each about 1.2 m wide by 5.6 m long are 
installed on each module rejecting a total of about 12 kW. The 
radiators are interfaced with the module thermal control loop by 
use of a refrigerant 21 loop with an on-orbit operable disconnect 
at each panel. A one-panel test article has been designed and is 
currently being fabricated. Testing is scheduled to be conducted

This paper presents the results of performance tests of several 
dual-slot heat pipe test articles. The dual-slot configuration has a 
very high thermal transport capability and has been identified as 
a very promising candidate for the radiator system for the NASA 
Space Station solar dynamic power modules. Two six-foot long 
aluminum heat pipes were built and tested with ammonia and 
acetone. A 20-ft long heat pipe was also built and tested with 
ammonia. The test results have been compared with performance 
predictions. A thermal transport capacity of 2000 W at an adverse 
tilt of 1 in. and a 1000 W capacity at an adverse tilt of 2 in. were 
achieved on the 20-ft long heat pipe. These values are in close 
agreement with the predicted performance limits. Author

optimum thickness, the effects of surface roughness along with 
foil hardness and foil thermal conductivity were evaluated. Results 
indicate that for a given foil thickness, an optimum surface

The Space Station Active Thermal Control System (ATCS) has 
been modeled using modified SINDA/SINFLO programs to solve 
two-phase Thermo-fluid problems. The modifications include 
changes in several subroutines to incorporate implicit solution which 
allows larger time step as compared to that for explicit solutions. 
Larger time step saves computer time but involves larger 
computational error. Several runs were made using various time 
steps for the ATCS model. It has been found that for a reasonable 
approach, three times larger time step as compared to that used 
in explicit method is a good value which will reduce the computer 
time by approximately 50 percent and still maintain the accuracy 
of the output data to within 90 percent of the explicit values.

A conceptual space platform consists of a payload, a power 
conditioning unit (PCU), and two radiators: the main radiator and 
a secondary radiator. A computer program was written to determine 
the required size of the two radiators and the temperatures of the 
PCU and payload for a given platform power level. An iterative 
approach is necessary because the required size of the main 
radiator depends on the size of the secondary radiator and vice 
versa. Also, the temperatures of the payload and PCU depend on 
the size of the radiators. The program user can subdivide the two 
radiators into any number of nodes to increase the accuracy of 
the radiant heat transfer solution. The use of more nodes also 
allows better prediction of the nonlinear temperature drop that 
occurs across the radiators as the working fluid deposits the 
platform's waste heat in the radiator. View factor expressions are 
automatically calculated for different choices of the number of 
nodes. The user can also select different separation distances 
between the various platform structures. A model is included to 
couple the radiant and conduction heat transfer that occurs 
between the payload and its meteoroid shell and between the 
PCU and its shell. DOE

Concepts for a moveable thermal joint are discussed with 
respect to the applicability in a dedicated deployable or steerable 
heat pipe radiator system to handle the waste heat of the NiH 
batteries of the Polar Platform. Possible candidates for near-term 
deployable radiator development are: the flexible heat pipe; the 
low-melting-point alloy filled, grease filled, or low pressure helium 
gas filled (finned) heat exchanger; the braided conductor (having 
high mass and retraction torque); and the clamped contact. The 
flexible heat pipe is less attractive for steerable radiator 
applications. The braided conductor and the clamped contact are 
inadequate. The nonsolid material filled heat exchanger is the 
preferable joint if steerability is required. ESA

Reflective mirror segments have been developed to form the 
basis of the light-condensing units for solar condensers for space 
stations. One type (A), a carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) 
skin surrounding an aluminum honeycomb structure, aims for a 
high degree of precision in the mirror surface. A second type (B) 
is constructed from a surface skin alone and is extremely light in 
weight. For both, the surface roughness was 0.03. Reflectivity 
was 85.5 percent for Type A and 89.5 percent for Type B. In 



terms of condensivity, light traveling parallel to the mirror axis fell 
within a 3 by 3 mm area on a position detection sensor located 
1,600 mm from the mirror surface for Type A, with most of the 
light falling within 1 mm from the center, while for Type B the 
light was concentrated within a 10 by 10 mm area. At this distance, 
the spreading of light waves due to spherical aberration is expected 
to be slightly under 2 mm for an ideal spherical surface, so that 
Type A shows a very good degree of precision. J.P.B.

The feasibility of fabricating and processing moderate 
temperature range vapor chamber type heat pipes in a low mass 
honeycomb panel configuration for highly efficient radiator fins for 
potential use on the space station was investigated. A variety of 
honeycomb panel facesheet and core-ribbon wick concepts were 
evaluated within constraints dictated by existing manufacturing 
technology and equipment. Concepts evaluated include type of 
material, material and panel thickness, wick type and 
manufacturability, liquid and vapor communication among 
honeycomb cells, and liquid flow return from condenser to 
evaporator facesheet areas. A thin-wall all-welded stainless steel 
design with methanol as the working fluid was the initial prototype 
unit. It was found that an aluminum panel could not be fabricated 
in the same manner as a stainless steel panel due to diffusion 
bonding and resistance welding considerations. Therefore, a formed 
and welded design was developed. The prototype consists of ten 
panels welded together into a large panel 122 by 24 by 0.15 in., 
with a heat rejection capability of 1000 watts and a fin efficiency

space-based platform as a function of the maximum-allowed 
operating temperature of the electrical equipment within the 
platform payload. Two computer programs were used in conjunction 
to perform these calculations. The first program was used to 
determine the mass of the platform reactor, shield, and power 
conversion system. The second program was used to determine 
the mass of the main and secondary radiators of the platform. 
The main radiator removes the waste heat associated with the 
power conversion system and the secondary radiator removes 
the waste heat associated with the platform payload. These 
calculations were performed for both Brayton and Rankine cycle 
platforms with two different types of payload cooling systems: a 
pumped-loop system (a heat exchanger with a liquid coolant) and 
a refngerator system. The results indicate that increases in the 
maximum-allowed payload temperature offer significant platform 
mass savings for both the Brayton and Rankine cycle platforms 
with either the pumped-loop or refrigerator payload cooling systems. 
Therefore, with respect to platform mass, the development of high 
temperature electrical equipment would be advantageous. DOE

A link between the ASKA finite element program and the 
Dynamic and Control Analysis Package (DCAP) was developed. 
An interface software package called Interface DCAP (IFDCAP) 
was generated to transfer numerical data, describing the structural 
behavior of flexible bodies, between ASKA and DCAP. Ten test 
cases were defined in order to demonstrate the functioning of the 
interface program. Methodologies and links for data transfer 
between the System Improved Numerical Differencing Analyzer 
(SINDA) and ASKA were established. A temperature interpolation 
technique based on the prescribed average technique was 
developed. Using the finite element model of the structure with its 
conduction matrix, the thermal model temperatures are interpolated 
to obtain temperatures in all nodes of the structural model. A 
software package called SINAS to transfer SINDA nodal 
temperatures to the ASKA model nodes was written. Four test 
cases to demonstrate the functional performance of the interface 
package SINAS were defined. ESA

Regenerable C02/motsture removal techniques that reduce the 



expendables and logistics requirements are needed to sustain 
people undertaking EVAs for the Space Station. Here, the 
development of electrochemically regenerable C02 absorption 
(ERCA) technology to replace the nonregenerable LiOH absorber 
for the advanced Portable Life Support System (PLSS) is reported. 
During EVA the ERCA uses a mechanism involving gas absorption 
into a liquid absorbent for the removal and storage of the 
metabolically produced C02 and moisture. Following the EVA, the 
expended absorbent is regenerated onboard the Space Station 
by an electrochemical C02 concentrator. The ERCA concept has 
the ability to effectively satisfy the high metabolic C02 and moisture 
removal requirements of PLSS applications. This paper defines 
the ERCA concept and its advantages for the PLSS application, 
reviews breadboard test data, and presents physical characteristics

weak-base-anion exchange resin packed in a meta(-foam-matrix 
heat exchanger. This system simultaneously removes C02 and 
water vapor, with the resulting exothermic heat of reaction rejected 
to the heat exchanger. The system has no moving parts, resulting 
in a highly reliable simple configuration. Regeneration may be 
accomplished via internal heating and vacuum. Author

The benefits and penalties associated with the generation of 
high pressure gases using the SPE water electrolysis subsystem 
are presented. The Space Station has a number of requirements 
for oxygen and hydrogen generation at very high pressures 
(between 1000 and 6000 psia) including emergency pressurization 
and repressurization of habitability and laboratory modules, 
recharge of the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) oxygen tanks, 
and propulsion capability for Station reboost and attitude control. 
The traditional trade study parameters of weight, volume, power, 
and heat rejection are considered. The ramifications of the use of 
a high pressure, solid polymer electrolyte-based system are 
discussed with respect to Space Station safety and maintenance.

The possibility of microbial contamination and spread in 
spacecraft water systems during long-duration missions calls for 
initial system disinfection, initial water supply disinfection, and 
maintenance of disinfection throughout the water distribution 
system. Attention must also be given to episodic system disinfection 
capabilities and the isolation of the water supply from any 
back-contamination or cross-contamination. Especially severe

Throughout the history of manned space flight the supply of 
potable water to the astronauts has presented unique problems. 
Of particular concern has been the microbiological quality of the 
potable water. This has required the development of both preflight 
water system servicing procedures to disinfect the systems and 
inflight disinfectant addition and monitoring devices to ensure 
continuing microbiological control. The disinfectants successfully 
used to date have been aqueous chlorine or iodine. Because of 
special system limitations the use of iodine has been the most 
successful for inflight use and promises to be the agent most 
likely to be used in the future. Future spacecraft potable, hygiene, 
and experiment water systems will utilize recycled water. This will 
present special problems for water quality control. NASA is currently 
conducting research and development to solve these problems.

This study was done to quantify the sensitivity of bacteha to 
iodine under controlled laboratory conditions. When exposed to 1 
mg/1 12 for 1 min, bacteria isolated from the Shuttle were more 
resistant than a P. aeruginosa isolated from a povidine-iodine 
solution. Cultures grown in rich media were more sensitive than 
those grown in low nutrient solutions. The P. aeruginosa and a P. 
cepacia isolated from the Shuttle were resuspended in PBW after 
exposure to iodine, lodinated cells recovered better than 
uniodinated controls. Pseudomonads in biofilms developed on 
coupons of stainless steet were more resistant to iodine than 
cells suspended in buffered water. Although resistant bacteria may 
colonize spacecraft water systems, multiple treatment barriers 
should provide adequate control of these contaminants. Author

TOXICOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF WATER RECYCLE AND 

DISINFECTION

Two sources of toxic chemicals are readily recognized in 
recycling wastewater for potable purposes: those introduced by 
the prior use of the water and those introduced during treatment 
and distribution of the water. Historically, the focus in water 
treatment has been directed towards the former source and with 
little attention being paid to the latter. In a system with a source 
that is made up of primarily domestic types of waste, the production 
of by-products with treatment chemicals and the leaching of 
materials from surfaces that contact potable water are important 
sources of toxic chemicals. The most instructive example involves 
by-products generated during disinfection. A system such as that 
contemplated for the Space Station may well magnify these 
problems unless the treatment is designed to prevent chemicals 
from these sources from accumulating in the water system. The 
present paper focuses on the genesis of these problems and the 
toxicological hazards that result. Author

The effects of microbial fouling on treatment bed (TB) 
performance are being studied. Fouling of activated carbon (AC) 
and ion exchange resins (lEX) by live and devitalized bacteria can 
cause decreased capacity for selected sorbates with AC and lEX 
TB. More data are needed on organic species removal in the 
trace region of solute sorption isotherms. TB colonization was 
prevented by nonclassical chemical disinfectant compositions 
(quaternary ammonium resins) applied in suitable configurations. 
Recently, the protection of carbon beds via direct disinfectant 
impregnation has shown promise. Effects (of impregnation) upon 
bed sorption/removal characteristics are to be studied with 
representative contaminants. The potential need to remove solutes 
added or produced during water disinfection and/or TB 
microbiological control must be investigated. Author

This paper describes the continued development of a

technologies when operated side by side on feed solutions of 
synthetic wash water are presented. The effects of soap type and 
operating temperature on membrane-module performance were 
determined. A preliminary ranking of these modules indicated that 
several of the reverse-osmosis and ultrafiltration technologies are 
excellent candidates for use in the subsystem. At this time, a 
hybrid system configuration consisting of a first-stage ultrafiltration 
module followed by a second-stage reverse-osmosis module 
appears to be the most appropriate for use in the subsystem.

As the result of the human metabolism in the Space Station, 
carbon dioxide is discharged into the cabin atmosphere. It is 
indispensable to remove the carbon dioxide and keep it below 
the allowable level for life support in a closed environment. The 
regenerative carbon dioxide removal system is necessary for the 
Space Station to decrease the life-cycle cost. The Solid Amine 
Water Desorbed (SAWD) system is considered as a competitive 
option among several candidate systems. In the SAWD process, 
the carbon dioxide gas is adsorbed by the ion-exchange-type solid 
amine, which is bedded in the canisters, and desorbed by heating 
the solid amine with the direct steam flow. The adsorption and 
desorption stage of the canisters are proceeded alternatively by 
the automatic control. For the application in the Space Station, 
the SAWD system shall embody less resources as well as high 
performance and reliability. Author

Catalytic techniques for processing waste products onboard 
space vehicles were evaluated. The goal of the study was the 
conversion of waste to carbon, wash water, oxygen and nitrogen. 
However, the ultimate goal is conversion to plant nutrients and 
other materials useful in closure of an ecological life support system 
for extended planetary missions. The resulting process studied 
involves hydrolysis at 250 C and 600 psia to break down and 
compact cellulose material, distillation at 100 C to remove water, 
coking at 450 C and atmospheric pressure, and catalytic oxidation 
at 450 to 600 C and atmospheric pressure. Tests were conducted 
with a model waste to characterize the hydrolysis and coking 
processes. An oxidizer reactor was sized based on automotive 
catalytic conversion experience. Products obtained from the 
hydrolysis and coking steps included a solid residue, gases, water 
condensate streams, and a volatile coker oil. Based on the data 
obtained, sufficient component sizing was performed to make a 
preliminary comparison of the catalytic technique with oxidation 
for processing waste for a six-man spacecraft. Wet oxidation seems 
to be the preferred technique from the standpoint of both 
component simplicity and power consumption. Author

The European Controlled Ecological Life Support System 
(CELSS) activities started in the late 1970's with system analysis 
and feasibility studies of Biological Life Support Systems (BLSS). 
The initiation for CELSS came from the industry side in Europe, 
but since then planning and hardware feasibility analyses have 
been initiated also from customer/agency side. Despite this, it is 
still too early to state that a CELSS program as a concerted 
effort has been agreed upon in Europe. However, the general 
CELSS objectives were accepted as planning and possible 
development goals for the European effort for manned space 
activities, and as experimental planning topics in the life sciences 
community for the next decades. It is expected that ecological life 
support systems can be tested and implemented on a space station 
towards the end of this century or early in the next. For the 



European activities a possible scenario can be projected based 
on ongoing life support system development activities and the 
present life sciences goals. Author

Development of Controlled Ecological Life Support System 
(CELSS) technology is inevitable for future long duration stays of 
human beings in space, for lunar base construction and for manned 
Mars flight programs. CELSS functions can be divided into 2 
categories, Environmental Control and Material Recycling. 
Temperature, humidity, total atmospheric pressure and partial 
pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide, necessary for all living 
things, are to be controlled by the environment control function. 
This function can be performed by technologies already developed 
and used as the Environment Control Life Support System (ECLSS) 
of Space Shuttle and Space Station. As for material recycling, 
matured technologies have not yet been established for fully 
satisfying the specific metabolic requirements of each living thing 
including human beings. Therefore, research activities for 
establishing CELSS technology should be focused on material 
recycling technologies using biological systems such as plants 
and animals and physico-chemical systems, for example, a gas 
recycling system, a water purifying and recycling system and a 
waste management system. Japanese research activities were 
conducted and will be continued accordingly. Author

Parametric data for six waste management subsystems 
considered for use on the Space Station are compared, i.e.: (1) 
dry incineration; (2) wet oxidation; (3) supercritical water oxidation; 
(4) vapor compression distillation; (5) thermoelectric integrated

ammonia removal. The parameters selected for comparison are 
on-orbit weight and volume, resupply and return to Earth logistics, 
power consumption, and heat rejection. Trades studies are 
performed on subsystem parameters derived from the most recent 
literature. The Boeing Engineering Trade Study (BETS), an 
environmental control and life support system (ECLSS) trade study 
computer program developed by Boeing Aerospace Company, is 
used to properly size the subsystems under study. The six waste 
treatment subsystems modeled in this program are sized to process 
the wastes for a 90-day Space Station mission with an 8-person 
crew, and an emergency supply period of 28 days. The resulting 
subsystem parameters are compared not only on an individual 
subsystem level but also as part of an integrated ECLSS.

The Space Station Safe Haven Food System must sustain 8 
crew members under emergency conditions for 45 days. Emergency 
Survival Foods are defined as a nutritionally balanced collection 
of high density food and beverages selected to provide for the 
survival of Space Station flight crews in contingency situations. 
Since storage volume is limited, the foods should be highly 
concentrated. A careful study of different research findings 
regarding starvation and calorie restricted diets indicates that a 
minimum nutritional need close to PDA is an important factor for 
sustaining an individual's life in a stressful environment. Fat, protein, 
and carbohydrates are 3 energy producing nutrients which play a 
vital role in the growth and maintenance process of human life. A 
lower intake of protein can minimize the water intake, but it causes 
a negative nitrogen balance and a lower performance level. Other 
macro and micro nutrients are also required for nutritional 
interrelationships to metabolize the other 3 nutrients to their 
optimum level. The various options for longer duration than 45 
days are under investigation. Author

purpose is the detection and study of planetary systems about 
nearby stars. With the recent change in the space station program 
to two phases, the suitability of initial operations from the phase 
1 station need to be evaluated. This paper presents the results of 
such an evaluation for the Astrometric Telescope Facility.

The combination of quadrupole ion trap tandem mass 
spectroscopy with artificial intelligence is a promising approach 
for monitoring the performance of the life support systems in the 
space station. Such an analytical system can provide the selectivity, 
sensitivity, speed, small size, and decision making intelligence to 
detect, identify, and quantify trace toxic compounds which may 
accumulate in the space station habitat. Author

The Automated Subsystem Control for Life Support System 
(ASCLSS) program has successfully developed and demonstrated 
a generic approach to the automation and control of Space Station 
subsystems. The hierarchical and distributed real time controls 
system places the required controls authority at every level of the 
automation system architecture. As a demonstration of the 
automation technique, the ASCLSS system automated the Air 
Revitalization Group (ARG) of the Space Station regenerative 
Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) using 
real-time, high fidelity simulators of the ARG processess. This 
automation system represents an early flight prototype and an 
important test bed for evaluating Space Station controls technology 
including future application of ADA software in real-time control 
and the development and demonstration of embedded artificial 
intelligence and expert systems (AI/ES) in distributed automation 
and controls systems. Author

Microbial food sources are becoming viable and more efficient 
alternatives to conventional food sources, especially in the context 
of closed ecological life support systems (CELSS) in space habitats. 
Two bioreactor design concepts presented represent two dissimilar 
approaches to grappling with the absence of gravity in space 
habitats and deserve to be tested for adoption as important 
components of the life support function aboard spacecraft, space 
stations and other extra-terrestrial habitats. R.J.F.

A review is presented of advances in ballistocardiographic 



studies during weightlessness aboard Salyut-6 and -7 space ships, 
as well as in controlled ground experimentation. The latter involved 
ten 19 to 20-year-old males subjected to antiorthostatic kinesia 
for prolonged periods of time to simulate weightlessness. In general, 
the results of both series were in agreement. Over a 90-day pehod 
three basic phases of changes in cardiac contractility were 
identified. The initial stage was a diminished mechanical activity 
of the right heart. The second stage consisted of enhanced 
contractility of the right ventricle with simultaneous reduction in 
the contractility of the left heart. The final stage was a reversal of 
the phenomenon in the second stage, i.e., enhanced contractility 
of the left ventricle with concomitant reduction in contractility of 
the right heart. Further developments in ballistocardiographic 
techniques and equipment will lead to an expanded use of this 
technology in clinical medicine, following its initial development 
for space physiology. Author

Using the example of the chair, which is often written into 
space station planning but which serves no non-cultural function 
in zero gravity, difficulties in overcoming cultural assumptions are 
discussed. An experimental approach is called for which would 
allow designers to separate cultural assumptions from logistic, 
social and psychological necessities. Simulations, systematic doubt 
and monitored brainstorming are recommended as part of basic 
research so that the designer will approach the problems of space 
module design with a complete program. J.P.B.

A laser distance and displacement measurement system is 
being developed to monitor small displacements in large space 
structures for strain analysis and structural control. The reflected 
laser beam is focused on a detector and the detected signal is 
mixed with the reference. Small displacements are indicated by a 
change in modulation frequency which Is adjusted to maintain 
quadrature between the received signal and the reference signal 
from the voltage-controlled oscillator in a phase-locked loop. 
Measurement of absolute distance is accomplished by sweeping 
the modulation frequency from a quadrature lock point to an 
adjacent lock point. Author

Knowledge of the first mode together with the hub position may 
be used to determine the angular position of a hub to tip projection. 
A self-tuning control is devised by treating this angle as belonging 
to an equivalent rigid link. Laboratory experiments show this control 
to lead to an improved performance over a control which ignores 
compliance. Author

The decoupled control of an optimally designed space structure 
is considered. The optimal structure is a derivative of the CSDL I 
model spacecraft. In particular, the effects of structural 
perturbations on the optimal design are considered. The stiffness 
matrix for the structure is perturbed by changing the areas of its 
rod members. A LQR controller with modal suppression is designed 
for the nominal system. The controller is used on the perturbed 
systems and the effects on modal suppression noted. The spillover 
into the suppressed modes due to perturbations is also quantified 
in terms of the change in the row and column space of the control 
and observation matrices, respectively. The results obtained are 
compared to those obtained for the nominal CSDL I model.

in the study of noncoplanar, aeroassisted orbital transfer are 
considered and are illustrated with the example of LEO-to-LEO 
transfer. Trajectory control is achieved by modulation of the lift 
coefficient and the angle of bank. Problems considered include 
the minimization of the energy required for orbital transfer, 
maximization of the flight time during the atmospheric portion of 
the trajectory, and minimization of the peak heating rate. The 
near-grazing solution is found to be a good compromise between 
energy and heating requirements. R.R.

THE DYNAMICS AND CONTROL OF LARGE SPACE 

STRUCTURES AFTER THE ONSET OF THERMAL SHOCK

This paper considers the problem of predicting the open and 
closed loop dynamics of large space structures after the onset of 
thermal shock. The thermal gradients induced in space structures 
due to solar radiation heating result in thermal deformations. The 
temperature gradient time history, the related thermal deflection 
response, the moments acting on a thermally deflected beam, 
and the control effort required for different combinations of solar 
incidence angles and material properties are considered in this 
investigation. The analysis is performed for structures which are 
nominally inertially stabilized as well as gravity stabilized. For the 
case of basic orbiting structural elements, such as a free-free 
plate (modeled as a beam in-plane), depending on the orientation, 
and required pointing accuracy, it may be necessary to redesign 
control algorithms previously developed for models which exclude 
the thermal shock effects. Author

The librational dynamics of a flexible platform for the support 
of a mobile base that is connected to a series of slewing, flexible 
appendages is presently studied in light of a general formulation 
applicable to missions requiring slew maneuvers for antennas, 
telescopes, observational instruments, and remote manipulators. 
The formulation's application is illustrated by a rigid-platform 
satellite with slewing rigid appendage, a flexible beam-type platform 
with a flexible slewing arm, and a configuration representing a 
Space Shuttle-based flexible beam with a rigid reflector at its end. 
The results obtained indicate system instability under critical 
combinations of inertia parameters, orbit geometries, and 
transiationai and slewing-time histories. 0,C.

A new control algorithm, named the mission function control, 
is introduced and applied to slew maneuver of a spacecraft with 
a flexible appendage. The control algorithm is a type of the 
Liapunov's method applied to a mechanical system combined with 
a control system and employs the concept of the generalized 
energy functions. The flexible appendage is modeled in terms of 
the partial differential equations which is believed to describe most 
precisely the distributed systems. Implementation of the control 
algorithm naturally results with physical meanings and it is shown 
that it is necessary to sense the shearing force and bending 
moment at the root of the flexible appendage. Results of numerical 
simulation show an excellent controlled behavior for the slew 
maneuver. Author

06 DYNAMICS AND CONTROLS 



Brighton, England, Oct 10-17, 1987. 7 p. refs 
(lAF PAPER 87-355) 

The paper deals with two main uncontrolled attitude motion 
regimes of the orbital stations Salyut-6 and Salyut-7: the single 
axis gravitational orientation regime and the slow rotation regime. 
The peculiarities of dynamics and practical applications of these 
regimes are given. The paper describes integral statistic methods 
of the determination of passive rotational motion of the stations 
according to the onboard attitude sensor measurements. The 
examples of using these methods for the solution of some scientific 
problems (calculations of the microacceleration at the station, the 
processing of star photometer indications, etc.) are given. An 
analysis of dynamic effects revealed through the processing of 
measurements made during long periods of passive spaceflight is 
performed. Author

ACCELERATION MEASUREMENT AND MANAGEMEKT ON A 

SPACE STATION

Ultimately, the capability is needed to actively position the 
line of minimum acceleration through prescribed experiment 
locations on a space station. For accelerations varying on time 
scales comparable to, or longer than, the orbital period, the 
acceleration depends on the rotational motion of the station, on 
atmospheric drag, on gravity gradient effects, and on the instrument 
position relative to the center of mass. For a busy station, the 
center of mass will not be well located unless it is determined by 
on-board instrumentation. For a station with geocentric radial 
attitude in a circular orbit, the combined acceleration due to gravity 
gradients and station rotation has two components: one in the 
radial direction and a second normal to the orbit plane. The main 
component of atmospheric drag has the direction of the velocity 
vector. Measurements by three orthogonal linear accelerometers 
can be used to determine the drag acceleration and two orthogonal 
coordinates of the center of mass. This determination requires 
knowledge of orbital and attitude parameters. The processed 
accelerometer results can serve as signals to devices that displace 
mass to adjust the center of mass and the minimum acceleration 
line to desired positions. Author

An aerobrake design accounting for all of the important flow 
phenomenology which are characteristic of aerobraking vehicles 
is proposed as the mission baseline. Flight regimes and aerothermal 
environments for both Mars and earth entry are calculated using 
advanced methods to account for real-gas, thermochemical, 
relaxation effects. The results are correlated with thermal-protection 
and structural requirements and mission performance capability. 
The importance of nonequilibrium radiative heating for earth 
aerocapture is demonstrated. It is suggested that two aerobrakes 
of different sizes will produce optimal performance for the three 
phases of the mission (i.e., one aerobrake for Mars aerocapture 
and descent of the surface lander and another for earth return).

Solar pressure effects on GEO satellites can be harnessed by 
means of solar sails to furnish attitude control. In the case of the 
OTS2 satellite, two fixed solar sails are mounted on the solar 
arrays in order to improve control efficiency; disturbance-related 
torques are estimated by the ground station, and compensated 
for by solar array pointing angle, while control torques are achieved 
by low depointing of the solar arrays to angles that are computed 
onboard. The total required depointing of the solar arrays limits 
their efficiency loss to 1 percent. O.C.

This paper presents some results obtained during the 
investigation of attitude and antenna pointing control systems for 
a large geostationary Data Relay Satellite; due to high requirements 
in terms of pointing accuracy and admissible defocusing, the 
problem of interaction between the spacecraft structure and control 
has a considerable significance. The modelization of flexible 
substructures and liquid sloshing, and the derivation of linear and 
nonlinear models are described. A comparative study of several 
control concepts, with or without active control of flexible modes, 
is presented here for both normal and station-keeping modes. 
Simulation results and performance evaluations of selected control 
systems are shown. The study synthesis leads to point out some 
recommendations for further studies. Author

APPLICATION OF ADAPTIVE OBSERVERS TO THE CONTROL 

OF FLEXIBLE SPACECRAFT

A difficulty in the control of targe flexible structures arises 
from model uncertainty of a deterministic nature. The modern 
state-space theory of quadratic regulators yields a robust feedback 
design, that is one that is relatively insensitive to uncertainty. 
However, the state estimator (i.e., asymptotic observer) limits the 
overall robustness of the controller. State estimation may be 
enhanced by using Kreisselmeier's (1982) continuous-time adaptive 
observer, modified to adapt on a small number of physically 
meaningful parameters. The above techniques are applied to the 
stationkeeping-mode attitude control of a possible growth version 
of Olympus having much larger solar arrays. No special test signal 
is used to force the convergence of the parameter identification 
loop. The controllers are evaluated in the presence of noise, 
thruster nonlinearity and unmodeled dynamics. The use of the 
adaptive observer is found to enhance the robustness of the 
controller, while maintaining the pointing within specification. The 
method shows promise for more general flexible space 
structures. Author

In an attempt to understand the observed behavior of force

the fidelity of this model along a single degree of freedom. It is 
found that an impedance control structure can provide substantial 
performance advantages especially when significant 
communication delays are present. K.K.

In this paper, an approach to solving the attitude determination 
problem for satellites is presented. The technique uses standard 
CCD video and requires the identification of the camera plane 
coordinates of at least three known points on the object. To 
facilitate detection of these points, illuminated retroreflectors are 
mounted in a known configuration on the satellite's surface. A 
CCD camera equipped with a computer-controlled focus, iris, and 
zoom is used to detect the reflector locations. Image processing 
is used to distinguish the reflectors from the background. Once 
the reflector image is found, the reflector centroid can be 
determined. These centroids, together with knowledge of the 
original location of the reflectors on the satellite, are used to 
compute the attitude. CD.

control requirements is derived for a fixed-attitude, earth-orbiting 
spacecraft with large area articulating appendages. Environmental 
effects such as gravity gradient, solar radiation pressure, and 
aerodynamic forces arising from a dynamic, rotating atmosphere 
are examined. It is shown that, in general, each environmental 
effect contributes to both cyclic and secular momentum 
requirements both within and perpendicular to the orbit plane. 
The gyroscopic contribution to the angular momentum control 
requirements resulting from the rotating, earth-oriented spacecraft 
is also discussed. Special conditions are described whereby one 
or more components of the angular momentum can be made to 
vanish, or become purely cyclic. Computer generated plots for a

representing the Space Shuttle based flexible beam supporting a 
rigid reflector at its end. The analysis provides a useful insight 
into interactions between inertia parameters, orbit geometry, 
translational and slewing time histories, flexibility and initial 
conditions. Results suggest that under critical combinations of the 
parameters the system may become unstable. Author

The minimum time attitude slewing motion of a rigid spacecraft 
with its controls provided by torques and forces, which have their 
upper and lower limits prescribed, is considered. The two-point 
boundary-value problem is derived by applying the Pontriagin's 
Maximum Principle to the system and solved by using a 
quasi-lineahzation algorithm. The nominal solutions to the problem 
as well as the starting values of the total slewing time and the 
unknown initial costates for this algorithm are generated by using 
Euler's eigenaxis rotation theorem. It is pointed out that one of 
the four initial costates associated with the quaternions can be 
arbitrarily selected without affecting the optimal controls and, thus, 
simplifying the computation. The minimum slewing time is 
determined by shortening the total slewing time until at least one 
of the controls becomes a bang-bang type. Several numerical 
tests for the rigidized SCOLE model are presented to show the 
applications of the methods. Author

DYNAMICS OF EARTH-ORBITING FLEXIBLE SATELLITES

A novel approach to the dynamics of satellites with flexible 
multibody components is proposed. The property of invariance 
under superposed rigid-body motions of geometrically-exact 
structural theories is employed to refer the dynamics of motion 
directly to the inertial frame. To avoid numerical ill conditioning, 
the dynamics of the far field and the near field are treated separtely 
by introducing a rotationally-fixed floating frame, which is a parallel 
translate of the inertial frame. Constraint conditions to determine 
the orientation of floating frames proposed in the past are thus 
entirely bypassed. The proposed formulation can accommodate 
an unrestricted class of maneuvers under the action of follower 
forces and gravitational force, and is particularly suited for the 
dynamics of flexible multibody systems undergoing a broad range 
of deformations. Author

This paper is concerned with the problem of slewing a large 
structure in space and suppressing any vibration at the same 
time. The structure is assumed to undergo large rigid-body motions 
and small elastic deformations. A perturbation method permits a 
maneuver strategy independent of the vibration control. Optimal 
control and pole placement techniques, formulated to include 
first-order actuator dynamics, are used to suppress the vibration 
during maneuver. The theory is illustrated by simultaneous 
maneuvering and vibration control of the Spacecraft Control 
Laboratory Experiment (SCOLE) model in a space environment.

A control law is presented for three-axis rotational maneuvers 
of a spacecraft (orbiter)-beam-tip body (antenna or a reflector) 
configuration based on nonlinear inversion and modal velocity 
feedback. Using invertibility and functional reproducibility results, 
a decoupling attitude control law is presented such that, in the 
closed-loop system, the attitude angles of the spacecraft are 
independently controlled using the control moments acting on the 
space vehicle. This controller asymptotically decouples the flexible 
dynamics from the rigid one and also allows the decomposition of 
the elastic dynamics into two subsystems representing the 
transverse deflections of the beam in two orthogonal planes. These 
low-order subsystems are used for derivation of a modal velocity 
feedback stabilizer using the force and moment actuators at the 
end body. Simulation results are presented to show that, in the 
closed-loop system, attitude control and elastic mode stabilization 
are accomplished in spite of the parameter uncertainty and

Precise attitude and shape control of flexible spacecraft requires 
active control of flexural vibrations. This work is concerned with 
the root locus method applied to active vibration control systems 
for a certain class of flexible bodies. A general characteristic 
equation is first derived for a feedback system to control flexural 
vibrations with arbitrary numbers of sensors and actuators. Then 
it is shown for the first time that the characteristic equation in a 
determinantal form may be reduced to a mathematically tractable 
form. It is also shown that under the condition of colocation of 
sensors and actuators the characteristic equation takes a form by 
which the significance of the condition can be readily appreciated. 
Finally the paper presents a numerical study to illustrate a practical 
procedure of applying the root locus method to flexural vibration 
control systems. Author

The problem of design of actively controlled structures subject 
to restrictions on the damping parameters of the closed-loop system 
is formulated and solved as a multiobjective optimization problem. 



The purpose of control is to effectively suppress structural 
vibrations due to initial excitation. The cross-sectional areas of 
the members are treated as design variables. The structural weight 
and the controlled system energy are considered as objective 
functions for minimization. The goal programming approach is used 
for the solution of the multiobjective optimization problems. The 
procedure is illustrated through numerical simulations using two-bar 
and twelve-bar truss structures. Author

This paper studies three-axis attitude-control problems of a 
class of flexible spacecraft having elastic appendages. A linear 
quadratic regulator (LOR) associated with a state estimator is 
designed to control its attitude and the appendage vibration, 
simultaneously. In order to evaluate and demonstrate the controller 
performance, ground-based control experiments are conducted, 
using an ETS-VI laboratory model supported on a single-axis air 
table. The evaluation is made concered mainly with (1) LOR 
realization by using a thruster and a reaction wheel, and (2) stability 
robustness against the truncated vibration modes of flexible 
appendages. Author

This paper describes an integrated methodology for determining 
a decentralized control structure for LSS with corresponding 
low-order controllers. Structural decomposition is based on the 
use of the Generalized Hessenberg Representation (GHR). 
Controller design is accomplished by utilizing frequency weighting 
in the performance criterion, together with projective controls. The 
methodology is illustrated by a case study of a 40th-order space

A control law for three-axis rotational maneuvers of a spacecraft 
beam-tip body configuration based on non-linear inversion and 
modal velocity feedback is presented. A decoupling attitude control 
law is presented such that in the closed-loop system the attitude 
angles of the spacecraft are independently controlled, using the 
control moments acting on the space vehicle. This controller 
asymptotically decouples the flexible dynamics from the rigid one 
and also allows the decomposition of the elastic dynamics into 
two subsystems representing the transverse deflections of the 
beam in two orthogonal planes. These low-order subsystems are 
used for the derivation of a modal velocity feedback stabilizer 
using the force and moment actuators at the end body. Simulation 
results are presented to show the capability of the controller.

A method is presented for the selection of sensors and actuators 
whose outputs may contain correlated noise. A generalization of 
the earlier results of Closed-Loop Input/Output Cost Analysis 
(CIOCA) is provided which utilizes decompositions of the 
closed-loop quadratic cost function into contributions from each 
stochastic noise input and each weighted output. It is shown that 
under certain circumstances the elimination of a correlated noise 
input may degrade performance. Application to a flexible space

The need for approximation of model systems has increased 
since the realization of large space structures and high-speed 
and supermaneuverable aircraft that undergo rapid dynamic 
changes. This paper presents a method for simplifying systems 
made up of N interconnected subsystems by approximating only 
M of the N subsystems. Each of the M subsystems is reduced 
while all interactions are active, and the identities of all subsystems 
in the overall approximation are preserved. A new version of 
balanced controllers is shown to be generated by this method. A 
numerical example is included which compares the new method 
with other balancing methods, and the results are shown to favor 
the new method. CD.

A relevant facet of the application of Lyapunov 
gradient-generated robust control to unstable linear autonomous 
plants is explored. It is demonstrated that if the plant, the output, 
and the nominal stabilizing control satisfy certain conditions, then 
the robust component alone stabilizes the nominal plant. An 
example characterized by two zero eigenvalues and two negative 
real value poles is presented. These results assure that the robust 
component will fulfill the role of nominal stabilization successfully 
so long as the possible magnitude of the robust component can 
overcome the contribution of the instability to positiveness of the 
Lyapunov rate. CD.

Techniques for the active control of flexible structures and for 
modeling their behavior in the frequency and time domains are 
reviewed. The advantages of the frequency-domain approach are 
pointed out, and it is shown how processing of input signals and 
noise in the time-domain can lead to an equivalent collection of 
data in the frequency domain. The method is applied to the problem 
of the computer-aided analysis of transport aircraft flutter. The 
model is minimized to permit the obtaining of control laws. 
Canonical models are developed to solve the control problem. It 
is pointed out that the critical parameter of absolute damping is 
manifested at the level of the reduction of dimensionality, at the 
level of control filtering, and at the level of positive control. R.R.

system feedback gains are treated simultaneously as independent 
design variables. Multiple static and harmonic dynamic loading 
conditions are considered. Constraints are imposed on static 
displacements, natural frequencies, and the magnitudes of the 
steady-state dynamic displacements and actuator forces to ensure 
acceptable system behavior. Side constraints imposed on the 
design variables protect against the generation of unrealizable 
designs. Example problems are presented that demonstrate the 
method and underscore the importance of integrating the structural 
and active control system design process. Author

Active control of large flexible space structures is typically 
implemented to control only a few known elastic modes. This 
paper considers the stabilization of the neglected dynamics of the 
higher modes of vibration. An attempt is made to design modal 
controllers with improved spillover stability properties. Two 
formulations for designing the observer to improve spillover stability 
with minimum performance loss are proposed. One optimizes the 
noise statistics used in the design of the Kalman-Bucy Filter (KBF), 
while the other directly optimizes the the gain matrix of the KBF.

This paper describes the structural dynamic characteristics of 
a NASA reference space station configuration as defined in the 
November 1987 Space Station Program - Systems Engineering 
and Integration Engineering Data Book. The modes and frequencies 
of the station below 2.0 Hz were obtained and selected results 
along with rigid body properties are presented. A three-axis attitude 
control system using control moment gyros responding to attitude 
and attitude rate signals is used to regulate the orientation of the 
station. The stability of the control system with non-collocated 
sensors is investigated for both compensated and uncompensated 
control signals. Results from a closed-loop simulation of a 
commanded attitude change about three axes, and from a 
closed-loop simulation of the response of the station to an 
externally applied unit force impulse at the docking port are 
presented. These simulation results are used to evaluate the 
possible degree of control/structures interaction which could occur 
during normal operation of the station. Author

An active control process to reduce vibration transmitted from 
the Space Station structure to the vibration sensitive payload is 
evaluated. A low-friction air-bearing table is used to approximate 
zero gravity in the horizontal plane. An analog control system is 
described which activates calibrated air jets when displacement 
of the test mass is sensed. The air jet control system is found to 
introduce an effective damping factor in controlling the oscillatory 
response. The air-jet control system is designed such that the 
thrust force produces less than 10 to the -5th g acceleration of 
the payload. An analytical model has verified the amount of 
damping in addition to flow parameters such as the pressure drop 
across the valve and the air flow rate. R.R.

the advantages inherent in a passive control design. These 
advantages include strict stability, high reliability, relatively low cost, 
and little or no power requirements. This paper includes examples 
of large space structures which will benefit from passive damping 
treatments, the design goals characteristic of these structures, 
and outlines a basic design approach to achieve the desired 
damping levels in actual hardware. The paper also shows the

A nonlinear sleeve joint model which accounts for the presence 
of clearances, impact damping and dry (Coulombic) friction is 
developed- By studying the free and forced response of this model, 
it is seen that the overall damping appears to be predominantly 
viscouslike in nature. This is found to be true even for the cases 
studied where dry friction is the sole source of energy dissipation. 
The results are supported by the study of simplified joint models 
which use one-way viscous dampers and purely linear viscous 
elements to emulate the effects of impact and frictional damping.

Structural damping incorporates both material damping and 
energy dissipation due to macroscopic mechanisms such as joint 
friction. Numerous experimental techniques have been developed 
to obtain a measure of damping. However, there has been little 
distinction in the literature between material and structural damping. 



This paper discusses two experimental techniques for determining 
a measure of damping, namely, uniaxial tension-tension fatigue 
and free-free flexural resonance, and demonstrates that each of 
these methods measures a different type of damping, namely, 
material and structural damping, respectively. Author

The truss system of the Hubble Space Telescope is made of 
graphite epoxy tubes and beams that have very low material 
damping. This paper describes a systematic experimental 
evaluation of the damping capacity of the graphite epoxy material 
used in the telescope truss system. The damping capacity of the 
composite material was measured both under normal and elevated 
temperatures in atmospheric conditions and in vacuum. Both free 
decay and steady state methods were used to measure the 
damping ratio of different specimens under different boundary 
conditions. A method that involves an iterative least-squares 
curve-fitting technique for the measured frequency response data 
has been developed to improve the accuracy of the damping 
ratio estimation. A unique experimental setup was developed to 
measure the damping of the material in a vacuum chamber. It 
was found that outgassing (moisture desorption) has little effect 
on the damping of the specimen. On the other hand, it was 
observed that temperature has a significant effect on both the 
damping and resonance frequencies of the specimen. Author

is shown to be accurate and robust with respect to: (1) large 
errors in the original assumed differential equation model, including 
an assumed linear model, (2) low measurement frequency, (3)

Various concepts for advanced syspension systems have been 
proposed for counteracting gravity loads in ground vibration testing 
of large space structures. Approximating the flight modes of a 
low-frequency flexible structure in a ground test requires a very 
soft suspension system. The dynamic behavior of a passive 
zero-spring-rate mechanism, sometimes used for such ground 
testing, is analyzed. This mechanism reduces the stiffness inherent 
in suspending a test specimen by cables. However, the mechanism 
is shown to be sensitive to imperfections. Imperfections can initiate 
nonlinear behavior which becomes more pronounced at lower 
operating frequencies. Furthermore, large pendular motion of the 
suspension system couples with the vertical motion, producing 
additional nonlinearity. Author

This investigation is concerned with the dynamics and control 
of a spacecraft comprising a rigid platform and a given number of 
retargetting flexible antennas. The mission consists of maneuvering 
the antennas so as to coincide with preselected lines of sight 
while stabilizing the platform in an inertial space and suppressing 
the elastic vibration of the antennas. The paper contains the 
derivation of the equations of motion by a Lagrangian approach 
using quasi-coordinates, as well as a procedure for designing the 
feedback controls. A numerical example involving a spacecraft 
consisting of a rigid platform and a single flexible antenna is 
presented. Author

Analyses of the effect of linear joint characteristics on the 
vibrations of a free-free, three-joint beam model show that 
increasing joint damping increases resonant frequencies and 
increases modal damping but only to the point where the joint 
gets 'locked up' by damping. This behavior is different from that 
predicted by modeling joint damping as proportional damping. 
Nonlinear analyses of the three-joint model with cubic springs at 
the joints show all the classical single DOF nonlinear response 
behavior at each resonance of the multiple DOF system: 
nondoubling of response for a doubling of forcing amplitude, 
multiple solutions, jump behavior, and resonant frequency shifts. 
These properties can be concisely quantified by characteristic 
backbone curves, which show the locus of resonant peaks for 
increasing forcing amplitude. Author

The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness 
of using extendable truss members to tailor the vibrational 
characteristics of large space structures. In contrast to the 
conventional control of structures using actuators mounted 
externally on the structures, the use of extendable truss members 
makes it possible to vary the control force internally, and, thus, 
achieve a change in natural frequencies and damping factors. A 
truss beam is employed as an example to demonstrate the effect 
of this approach in structural control. Author

This is the first of two reports on the dynamics and control of 
slewing maneuvers of the NASA Spacecraft Control Laboratory 
Experiment (SCOLE). In this report, the dynamics of slewing 
maneuvers of SCOLE are developed in terms of an arbitrary 
maneuver about any given axis. The set of dynamical equations 
incorporate rigid-body slew maneuver and three-dimensional 
vibrations of the complete assembly comprising the rigid shuttle, 
the flexible beam, and the reflector with an offset mass. The 
analysis also includes kinematic nonlinearities of the entire 
assembly during the maneuver and the dynamics of the interaction 
between the rigid shuttle and the flexible appendage. The final 
set of dynamical equations obtained for slewing maneuvers is 
highly nonlinear and coupled in terms of the flexible modes and 
the rigid-body modes. The equations are further simplified and 
evaluated numerically to include the first ten flexible modes and 
the SCOLE data to yield a model for designing control systems to 
perform slew maneuvers. Authoi

An analysis is made of the effects of errors and uncertainties 
in the predicting of disturbance torques on the peak momentum 
buildup on a space station. Models of the disturbance torques 
acting on a space station in low Earth orbit are presented, to 
estimate how accurately they can be predicted. An analysis of 
the torque and momentum buildup about the pitch axis of the 
Dual Keel space station configuration is formulated, and a derivation 
of the Average Torque Equilibrium Attitude (ATEA) is presented, 
for the case of no MRMS (Mobile Remote Manipulation System) 
motion, Y vehicle axis MRMS motion, and Z vehicle axis MRMS 
motion. Results showed the peak momentum buildup to be 
approximately 20000 N-m-s and to be relatively insensitive to errors 
in the predicting torque models, for 2 axis motion of the MRMS 
was found to vary significantly with model errors, but not exceed 
a value of approximately 15000 N-m-s for the Y axis MRMS motion 
with 1 deg attitude hold error. Minimum peak disturbance 
momentum was found not to occur at the ATEA angle, but at a 
slightly smaller angle. However, this minimum peak momentum 
attitude was found to produce significant disturbance momentum 
at the end of the predicting time interval. Author

An aerobrake design that has matured over several years of 
development accounting for all of the important flow 
phenomenology which are characteristic of aerobraking vehicles 
is proposed as the mission baseline. Flight regimes and aerothermal 
environments for both Mars and Earth entry are calculated using 
advanced methods to account for real-gas, thermochemical, 
relaxation effects. The results are correlated with thermal-protection 
and structural requirements and mission performance capability. 
The importance of nonequilibrium radiative heating for Earth 
aerocapture is demonstrated. It is suggested that two aerobrakes 
of different sizes will produce optimal performance for the three 
phases of the mission (i.e., one aerobrake for Mars aerocapture 
and descent of the surface lander and another for Earth return).

The quick suppression of the structural vibrations excited by 
bang-bang (BB) type time-optional slew maneuvers via 
modal-dashpot design of velocity output feedback control was 
investigated. Simulation studies were conducted, and modal 
dashpots were designed for the SCOLE flexible body dynamics. A 
two-stage approach was proposed for rapid slewing and precision 
pointing/retargeting of large, flexible space systems: (1) slew the 
whole system like a rigid body in a minimum time under specified 
limits on the control moments and forces, and (2) damp out the 
excited structural vibrations aftenwards. This approach was found 
promising. High-power modal/dashpots can suppress very large 
vibrations, and can add a desirable amount of active damping to 
modeled modes. Unmodeled modes can also receive some 
concomitant active damping, as a benefit of spillover. Results also 
show that not all BB type rapid pointing maneuvers wilt excite 
large structural vibrations. When properly selected small forces 
(e.g., vernier thrusters) are used to complete the specified slew 
maneuver in the shortest time, even BB-type maneuvers will excite 
only small vibrations (e.g., 0.3 ft peak deflection for a 130 ft 
beam). Author

A set of closely related topics concerning the methodology of 
an optimal attitude maneuver control of a satellite with flexible 
appendages is investigated, i.e., such as a mathematical model of 
coupled motion, pulse-mode control, optimal and programmed 
maneuvers, appendage vibration damping through adaptive control 
and conventional control, and an adaptive identification 
(deterministic and stochastic) algorithm of time-varying modal 
coordinate parameters. A distinctive feature of the research was 
that only the actuators of the central satellite attitude control system 
were assumed to perform both satellite attitude control and 
appendage deformation control. Some aspects of interaction 
between control system characteristics and structure/configuration 
design parameters are outlined. Author

Natural Control and the associated exponential stability 
characteristics of flexible space structures are described. Nest 
the dynamics of freely non-rotating flexible spacecraft are reviewed 
and the results extended to rotating flexible spacecraft. Finally, 
the effect of using a limited number of forces to control the

Three new feedback design algorithms are presented: (1) a 
generalized linear-quadratic regulator (LOR) formulation; (2) a 
generalized LQR formulation based on Lyapunov stability theorem; 
and (3) an eigenstructure assignment method using Sylvester's 
equation. In addition, a noniterative robust eigenstructure 
assignment algorithm via a projection method is introduced, which 
produces a fairly well-conditioned eigenvector matrix and provides 
an excellent starting solution for optimizations of various design 
criteria. Finally, two sets of numerical examples are adopted: 6th 
order mass-spring systems and various reduced order models of 
a flexible system. The numerical results confirm that the use of 
multi-criterion optimizations by using a minimum correction 
homotopy technique is a useful toot with significant potential for 
enhanced computer-aided design of control systems. The robust 
eigenstructure assignment algorithm is implemented and tested 
for a 24th reduced order model, which establishes the approach 
to be applicable to systems of at least moderate dimensionality. It 
is shown analytically and computationally that constraining 
closed-loop eigenvectors to equal open-loop eigenvectors generally 
does not lead to either optimal conditioning (robustness) of the 
closed-loop eigenvectors or minimum gain norm. Dissert. Abstr.

The problem inherent to large scale systems such as power 
network, communication network and economic or ecological 
systems were studied. The increase in size and flexibility of future 
spacecraft has put those dynamical systems into the category of 
large scale systems, and tools specific to the class of large systems 
are being sought to design control systems that can guarantee 
more stability and better performance. Among several survey 
papers, reference was found to a thorough investigation on 
decentralized control methods. Especially helpful was the 
classification made of the different existing approaches to deal 
with large scale systems. A very similar classification is used, 
even though the papers surveyed are somehow different from the 
ones reviewed in other papers. Special attention is brought to the 
applicability of the existing methods to controlling large mechanical 
systems like large space structures. Some recent developments 
are added to this survey. Author

This thesis will investigate several issues relating to the objective 
of improving the disturbance rejection of a Large Space Structure 
(LSS) type system. Due to properties of LSS systems, the design 
of the controller must address three main issues: 1) improving of 
the disturbance rejection properties of the system; 2) insuring that 
the controller is robust to modeling uncertainty; and 3) implementing 
the design as a low order output feedback controller. The 
disturbance rejection of the system will be quantified using the 
H-norm. An arbitrary level of disturbance rejection will then be 
achieved through a Linear Quadratic (LQ) minimization. This LQ 
solution produces a state feedback controller which is robust to 
modeling uncertainty. In order to realize this design, a low order 
output feedback controller will be designed based on the LQ 
solution using projective controls. The method described in this 
thesis will then be applied to a 40th order LSS example. Using a 
decentralized approach, a controller will be designed which satisfies 
the issues discussed above. GRA

Independent Modal Space Control (IMSC) is a control scheme 
that decouples the space structure into n independent second-order 
subsystems according to n controlled modes and controls each 
mode independently. It is well-known that the IMSC eliminates 
control and observation spillover caused when the conventional 
coupled modal control scheme is employed. The independent 
control of each mode requires that the number of actuators be 
equal to the number of modelled modes, which is very high for a 
faithful modeling of large space structures. A control scheme is 
proposed that allows one to use a reduced number of actuators 
to control all modeled modes suboptimally. In particular, the method 
of generalized inverse matrices is employed to implement the 
actuators such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system 
are as closed as possible to those specified by the optimal IMSC. 
Computer simulation of the proposed control scheme on a simply 
supported beam is given. Author

The feasibility of using piezoelectric actuators to control the 
flexural oscillations of large structures in space is investigated. 
Flexural oscillations are excited by impulsive loads. The vibratory 
response can degrade the pointing accuracy of cameras and 
antennae, and can cause high stresses at structural node points. 
Piezoelectric actuators have the advantage of exerting localized 
bending moments. In this way, vibration is controlled without 
exciting rigid body modes. The actuators are used in collocated 
sensor/driver pairs to form a feedback control system. The sensor 
produces a voltage that is proportional to the dynamic stress at 
the sensor location, and the driver produces a force that is 
proportional to the voltage applied to it. The analog control system 
amplifies and phase shifts the sensor signal to produce the voltage 
signal that is applied to the driver. The feedback control is 
demonstrated to increase the first mode damping in a cantilever 
beam by up to 100 percent, depending on the amplifier gain. The 
damping efficiency of the control system when the piezoelectrics

The Space Shuttle program has relied heavily on simulation 
throughout all phases of development and operation. Real-time, 
man-in-the-loop simulation has served the NASA manned space 
flight program by providing the means to evaluate systems design 
and integrated systems performance in a simulated flight 
environment as well as provide a means to train flight crews. 
New challenges are presented by the development and operation 
of a permanently manned space station. The assembly of the 
space station, the transferral of payloads and the use of the space 
station manipulator to berth the Orbiter are operations critical to 
the success of the space station. All these operations are examples

A new class of closed-form solutions for finite-time 
linear-quadratic optimal control problems is presented. The 
solutions involve Potter's solution for the differential matrix Riccati 
equation, which assumes the form of a steady-state plus transient 
term. Illustrative examples are presented which show that the new 
solutions are more computationally efficient than alternative 
solutions based on the state transition matrix. As an application 
of the closed-form solutions, the neighboring extremal path problem 
is presented for a spacecraft retargeting maneuver where a 
perturbed plant with off-nominal boundary conditions now follows 
a neighboring optimal trajectory. The perturbation feedback 
approach is further applied to three-dimensional slewing maneuvers 
of large flexible spacecraft. For this problem, the nominal solution 
is the optimal three-dimensional rigid body stew. The perturbation 
feedback then limits the deviations from this nominal solution due 



to the flexible body effects. The use of frequency shaping in both 
the nominal and perturbation feedback formulations reduces the 
excitation of high-frequency unmodeled modes. A modified Kalman 
filter is presented for estimating the plant states. Author

The development and features of the system used to control 
the rotary motion of the space complex, Mir, and orient it precisely 
during astronomical observations with equipment of the Kvant

modular structure, and powered gyroscopes (gyrodynes on a 
magnetic suspension) which function as drive motors. Development 
of gyrodynes for the Kvant module involved mathematical modeling 
of electromagnetic, dynamic and thermal processes. Mathematical 
modeling also indicated the necessity of a special system of spatial 
arrangement for six gyrodynes on the module and was used to 
prepare highly complex algorithms for the control system's 
computer. These algorithms take into account maintenance of the

The feasibility of a rendezvous and docking (RVD) mission in 
LEO using EURECA, to demonstrate an LEO dedicated RVD 
concept and for geostationary RVD demonstration in LEO was 
analyzed. Adequate verification methods for all RVD equipment 
and functions were identified. The purpose and logic of the ground 
test facilities within the development and verification phase of the 
RVD equipment and functions are outlined. The distinction between 
verification and validation is emphasized. Verification is concerned 
with all activities which prove that a design or performance feature 
is in accordance with a specification. Validation activities prove 
that the item or process is compatible with the reality, which 
includes to a certain extent also a verification of the specification. 
The demonstration mission constraints were identified and a 
mission timetable was established. ESA

This work presents the basic aspects concerning the 
construction of two test beds for satellite Attitude and Orbit Control 
Systems (AOCS) hardware-in-the-loop tests. The main goal to be 
reached with these test beds is the fast accomplishment of 
laboratory results in the various phaess of an AOCS development. 



from its initial conceptual definition to a prequalification phase. 
The central equipment of these test beds consists of a 
one-degree-of-freedom air bearing table and a two-degree-of-free- 
dom servo rate table. Various AOCS components such as reaction 
wheels, cold gas jet propulsion system, telemetry/telecommand 
system and celestial simulators were also developed at INPE. The 
designs of the test beds as integrated equipments are presented. 
The main performance parameters and associated experimental

A method for the determination of minimum time and delta-V 
orbit control strategies for the transfer of a chaser to a docking 
port on the V bar axis of a target is proposed under the assumption 
that the relative motion is described by the Clohessy-Wiltshire 
equations. Safety considerations in the design of the control are 
investigated. Forced motions along straight lines are investigated. 
It is shown that linear optimization methods can compute 
generalized minimum delta-V and safe orbit control strategies that 
protect the target from collision if the chaser is running out of 
control. Constraints on maneuver times, on the permissible 
trajectory region, and on the thrust level can be incorporated into 
the solution. ESA

Access for servicing, from the Space Station to satellites flying 
at similar or different orbital altitudes; limitations in accessibility 
due to differential nodal regression between the orbits in question; 
avoidance of high delta-V expenditures for plane change 
maneuvers; and the orbit transfer alternatives of retrieving a satellite 
from higher orbit for servicing at the station or shuttle versus in 
situ servicing at the satellite orbit altitude by using an orbital 
maneuvering vehicle carrying a telerobotic servicer and the 
necessary replacement parts are discussed. Scenarios that promise 
large cost savings through reduced propellant-to-orbit 
transportation charges as well as other mission operation 
expenditures are considered. Natural orbit evolution factors often 
can be exploited to provide these benefits. The cumulative savings 
are projected to amount to tens of millions of dollars per year.

A class of covariant bilateral force reflecting systems for 
teleoperation that enables the operator to use sensory feel to 
control the slave with a total transmission delay of 200 msec is 
introduced. The prototype 3 kWe electrohydraulic master-slave 
system has a fonward positional bandwidth of 20 Hz and is capable 
of positioning a mass of 4 kg flexibly supported at 0.75 m radius 
at a slew rate of 200 deg/sec. The reflected sensory force has a 
bandwidth greater than 250 Hz. Experimental evidence shows the 
master-slave system to appear transparent to the operator within 
the normal positional bandwidth. The operators therefore feel that 
they are directly swinging the load mass at the end of a flexible 
rod and are able to control the vibrations of the rod. This is not 
possible with simple positional control as the resonant system is 
outside the control loop. The operator uses the high frequency 
sensory information in an adaptive manner. However, with the 
transmission delay it is necessary to reduce the sensory force 
gain to obtain stability. ESA

An overall verification concept for a space RVD system and 
its elements was derived. The concept takes into account the 
verification objectives at all levels (system, subsystem, equipment), 
the possible ground tests and available test facilities, and the 
potential of on-orbit tests up to a complete demonstration mission 
with two spacecraft. The results reveal that verification activities 
can be done mostly on ground. For validation and demonstration 
purposes in orbit tests are recommended. An RVD demonstration

The Attitude and Orbital Control System (AOCS) is a basic 
component of a satellite. In order to guarantee the correct 
performance of the AOCS, exhaustive testing has to be done in a 
laboratory, both at component and at system level. This work 
intends to present first the implementation of an AOCS Simulation 
Laboratory by INPE's Space Mechanics and Control Department, 
as an example case, briefly showing the technological results 
already accomplished. It presents as well the basic aspects related 
to design, manufacture, and tests of a one degree-of-freedom

The emphasis in this study was on the use of multiple pass 
trajectories for aerobraklng. However, for comparison, single pass 
trajectories, trajectories using ballutes, and trajectories corrupted 
by atmospheric anomolies were run. A two-pass trajectory was 
chosen to determine the relation between sensitivity to errors and 
payload to orbit. Trajectories that used only aerodynamic forces 
for maneuvering could put more weight into the target orbits but 
were very sensitive to variations from the planned trajectors. Using 
some thrust control resulted in less payload to orbit, but greatly 
reduced the sensitivity to variations from nominal trajectories. When 
compared to the non-thrusting trajectories investigated, the 
judicious use of thrusting resulted in multiple pass trajectories that 
gave 97 percent of the payload to orbit with almost none of the 
sensitivity to variations from the nominal. Author

Binary mercury/organic Rankine systems have been assessed

shown to have the potential to attain cycle efficiencies greater 
than 40 percent. The efficiency is found to be more sensitive to 
maximum and minimum cycle temperatures than to the temperature 
at which heat is transferred from the mercury cycle to the toluene 
cycle. The specific mass is shown to depend primarily on the 
solar receiver and heat rejection radiator masses, and to have a 
minimum of between 62 and 40 kg/kWe. It is noted that the 
cycle can also be used in a cogeneration mode to provide thermal 
heat at constant temperature levels between 375 and 1 000 K.

Under the direction of NASA's Office of Aeronautics and 
Technology (OAST), the NASA Lewis Research Center has initiated 
an in-house thermal energy storage program to identify 
combinations of phase change thermal energy storage media for 
use with a Brayton and Stirling Advanced Solar Dynamic (ASD) 
space power system operating between 1070 and 1400 K. A study 
has been initiated to determine suitable combinations of thermal 
energy storage (TES) phase change materials (PCM) that result 
in the smallest and lightest weight ASD power system possible. 
To date the heats of fusion of several fluoride salt mixtures with 
melting points greater than 1025 K have been verified 
experimentally. The study has indicated that these salt systems 
produce large ASD systems because of their inherent low thermal 
conductivity and low density. It is desirable to have PCMs with 
high densities and high thermal conductivities. Therefore, alternate 
phase change materials based on metallic alloy systems are also 
being considered as possible TES candidates for future ASD space 
power systems. Author

Most of the power required for space-based defense systems 
is needed during only a short period of the orbital cycle, raising 
the possibility that the radiator size and mass can be reduced by 
including a thermal energy storage (TES) component in the heat 
rejection system. This paper presents the results of thermal 
performance analysis and optimization of five heat sink TES 
configurations using LiH as the storage medium. System 
performance was calculated for a wide range of parameters, 
including the effects of the prespecified internal void, enhanced 
thermal conductivity, and internal fins. Masses of storage matehals, 
encapsulating shells, and containment vessels were determined 
to give total system operational energy storage and power densities. 
The results show LiH-based TES systems can provide system 
energy and power densities ranging from 4 to 5 MJ/kg and 12 to 
17 kW/kg, respectively. LS.

A 16 parameter solar concentrator/ heat receiver mass model 
is used in conjunction with Stirling and Brayton Power Conversion 
System (PCS) performance and mass computer codes to determine 
the effect of thermal energy storage (TES) material property 
changes on overall PCS mass as a function of steady state 
electrical power output. Included in the PCS mass model are 
component masses as a function of thermal power for: 
concentrator, heat receiver, heat exchangers (source unless 
integral with heat receiver, heat sink, regenerator), heat engine 
units with optional parallel redundancy, power conditioning and 
control (PC and C), PC and C radiator, main radiator, and structure. 
Critical TES properties are: melting temperature, heat of fusion.

Preliminary results indicate that even though overall system 
efficiency increases with TES melting temperature up to 1400 K 
for concentrator surface accuracies of 1 mrad or better, reductions 
in the overall system mass beyond that achievable with lithium 
fluoride (LiF) can be accomplished only if the heat of fusion is at 
least 800 kJ/kg and the liquid density is comparable to that of 
LiF (1800 kg/cu m). Author

Recent studies indicate that significant increases in system 
performance (increased efficiency and reduced system mass) are 
possible for high power space based systems by incorporating 
technological developments with photovoltaic power systems. The 
Advanced Photovoltaic Concentrator Program is an effort to take 
advantage of recent advancements in refractive optical elements. 
By using a domed Fresnel lens concentrator and a prismatic cell 
cover, to eliminate metallization losses, dramatic reductions in the 
required area and mass over current space photovoltaic systems 
are possible. The advanced concentrator concept also has 
significant advantages when compared to solar dynamic Organic 



Rankine Cycle power systems in Low Earth Orbit applications where 
energy storage is required. The program is currently involved in 
the selection of a material for the optical element that will survive 
the space environment and a demonstration of the system 
performance of the panel design. Author

A combination solar photovoltaic heat engine converter is

than either the photovoltaic array or the heat engine atone can 
attain. Advantages in concentrator and radiator area and receiver

comparison between the proposed space station organic Rankine

The critical problem for the proposed converter is the necessity 
for high temperature photovoltaic array operation. Estimates of

The results of a tradeoff study to select an electrical power 
system configuration that is best suited for low-earth-orbit (LEO) 
spacecraft with various output power capabilities are presented. 
Two EPS configurations used for LEO spacecraft, i.e., (1) one 
using a direct energy transfer (DET) approach and (2) one using 
a peak power transfer (PPT) approach are described in detail and 
compared. At spacecraft power requirement of 800 watts or less, 
it is highly advantageous to choose the PPT approach to design 
an electrical power system for low earth orbit spacecraft. However, 
for a spacecraft in higher orbit and/or with higher power 
requirements, the DET-based power system is the optimum 
choice. Author

The selection of a 20K Hz power system for Space Station 
has generated a need for 20K Hz to dc and low frequency ac 
load converters. These converters are necessary to supply power 
to the previously designed 28V dc loads, 400 Hz motor loads, 
and other low voltage dc loads common in spacecraft applications. 
Straight forward converter techniques such as simple 
transformer-rectified-fi Iters and line comutating schemes produce 
untolerable EMC for spacecraft use if not properly designed. This 
paper will discuss some basic design techniques for building 20K 
Hz load converters. One of the most critical stages of the 20K Hz 
load converters are the input filters. Discussions of the various 
input filter topologies include the breadboard and analytical

Problems associated with transmission of 20 kHz power 
because of skin effect are well known. At 20 kHz, classical cable 
constructions (i.e., solid circular and those based on circular layup 
of multiple noninsulated strands) larger than 18 gauge utilize only 
a portion of the conductor cross section to carry current. The 
unused metal internal to the conduction layer ('skin') can represent 
considerable excess weight, volume, and material cost for relatively 
large diameters. In this paper several special constructions have 
been studied to facilitate making the best choice for given current 
levels and cable lengths to minimize or eliminate the wasted copper. 
Among the candidate constructions were Litz, flat conductor, 
coaxial, and multiple twisted pair. Selection criteria were efficiency 
of copper utilization, flexibility, EMI, impedances, volume, weight, 
manufacturing and assembly costs, and whether existing, new, or 
modified existing termination techniques and hardware would be 
used. Author

Research is currently undenway under contract with

A key technology here is artificial intelligence (Al). The numerous 
aspects of automating power control to reduce ground intervention 
have been examined to identify those Al would most benefit. This 
has resulted in multiple independent expert systems for load 
scheduling, load shed prioritizing (for rapid system safing), and 
fault management. These systems interface directly to the 
operational power management environment, provide substantial 
operations information and allow a wide range of user interaction. 
Here the major functional decomposition of power control activities

Automatic failure-cause diagnosis is a key element in 
autonomous operation of space power systems such as Space 
Station's. A rule-based diagnostic system has been developed for 
determining the cause of degraded performance. The knowledge 
required for such diagnosis is elicited from the system engineering 
process by using traditional failure analysis techniques. Symptoms, 
failures, causes, and detector information are represented with 
structured data; and diagnostic procedural knowledge is 
represented with rules. Detected symptoms instantiate failure 
modes and possible causes consistent with currently held beliefs 
about the likelihood of the cause. A diagnosis concludes with an 
explanation of the obsen/ed symptoms in terms of a chain of 
possible causes and subcauses. Author

A materials and processes development effort was performed 



to support the design, fabrication, and evaluation of solar array 
substrate composite structures for a spacecraft application. For 
stiffness, weight, and other design requirements, the basic sandwich 
structure incorporated a high-modulus graphite fiber/epoxy 
laminate. A film adhesive was utilized for facesheet/core bonding 
and as a dielectric protective layer on the surface of the substrate 
structure. Process studies determined cure cycles, fabrication 
techniques, bonding/assembly procedures, and related processing. 
Test coupons were fabricated and evaluated. Author

A proposal of extraterrestrial electricity generation with laser 
power beaming to earth is examined by taking actual historical 
production values and costs of critical elements (namely: 
photovoltaic array structures, C02 close cycle lasers, ground station 
gas turbine/generators and space transportation to low earth orbit) 
together with an estmation of the physical limits of the forecast 
criteria. A trend extrapolation reveals that this concept will not be 
an economical alternative to current small scale electricity 
generation in remote areas using diesel generators. The technique 
of technological forecasting is demonstrated and indicates that 
relatively rational planning can be achieved based on the analytical 
results. In this case: to abandon laser solar power satellites.

Methods are presented for the overall optimization of the energy 
systems of manned spacecraft on the basis of a new approach 
to the formulation of the functional requirements for an energy 
system. The methods presented here are free of inherent limitations 
on the power of system elements, flows, and operating modes of 
an energy system; they provide a way to simulate the combined 
operation of a redundant set of system elements with simultaneous 
structural and parametric optimization of the system. The discussion 
covers the problem of energy system optimization, with the initial 
data specified in a deterministic manner; the effect of the operating 
conditions of the orbital station on the selection of an optimal 
energy system; and energy system optimization under conditions 
of indeterminacy of the initial data. V.L,

The evolution of space power systems, which is driven by 
higher mission power requirements and longer mission life, is 
reviewed with particular reference to chemical, solar, and nuclear 
power systems. It is emphasized that a new generation of space 
platforms will demand options that more effectively use the energy 
source at reduced size, weight, and cost; these options will be 
derived from performance advances plus the addition of dynamic 
power conversion systems. A table is presented which shows space

The Space Station solar dynamic power system is a hybrid of 
solar photovoltaic and solar dynamic systems, the latter of which 
uses a parabolic reflector to collect solar energy. This paper 
describes analytical results of an off-axis solar illumination on the 
intensity distribution in arbitrary target planes perpendicular to the 
axis of a parabolic reflector. Such computational capability would 
make it possible to predict optical intensity distributions resulting 
from off-axis angles of incident radiation on such target planes. 
To validate the computer code, experimental optical measurements 
were performed on the multifaceted paraboloidal collecor at the 
Solar Dynamic Test Facility at Rockedyne's Santa Susana Field 
Laboratory. The experimental data compared reasonably well with 
the calculated values. I.S.

PLASMA CONTACTORS FOR USE WITH ELECTRODYNAMIC

Plasma contactors have been proposed as a means of making 
good electrical contact between biased surfaces such as found at 
the ends of an electrodynamic tether and the space environment. 
A plasma contactor is a plasma source which emits a plasma 
cloud which facilitates the electrical connection. The physics of 
this plasma cloud is investigated for contactors used as electron 
collectors and it is shown that contactor clouds in space will consist 
of a spherical core possibly containing a shock wave. Outside of 
the core the cloud will expand anisotropically across the magnetic 
field leading to a turbulent cigar shape structure along the field. 
This outer region is itself divided into two regions by the ion 
response to the electric field. A two dimensional theory of the 
motion of the cloud across the magnetic field is developed. The 
current voltage characteristic of an Argon plasma contactor cloud 
is estimated for several ion currents in the range of 1-100 Amperes. 
It is shown that small ion current contactors are more efficient 
than large ion current contactors. This suggests that if a plasma 
contactor is used on an electrodynamic tether, then a multiple 
tether array will be more efficient than a single tether. Author

The construction of a solar power system in space rather than 
on the surface of the earth has the advantages of higher energy 
yield, constant power return, and the simplicity of construction; a 
system in space will in the course of one year generate 
approximately 10 times the energy of an equivalent system on 
earth. This paper discusses the major design features and the 
basic elements of a 5000 MW solar power satellite system, together 
with the efficiency and the output power for each element of the 
system. Because of its extraordinary size (a mass of about 5x10 
to the 7th kg), a new type of rocket launch vehicle would be 
required, which would be completely reusable and would operate 
at a high frequency (the construction of a single 5000 MW satellite 
will require about 200 flights of the heavy-lift launch vehicle to 
low-earth orbit). The estimated expenditures needed for the 
deployment of the first solar power satellite are outlined, and the 
environmental effects are identified. I.S.

The value of a passive, maintenance-free, renewable energy 
source was immediately recognized in the early days of the space 
program, and the silicon solar cell, despite its infancy, was quickly 
pressed into service. Efficiencies of those early space solar arrays 
were low, and lifetimes shorter than hoped for, but within a decade 
significant advances had been made in both areas. Better 
performance was achieved because of a variety of factors, ranging 
from improvements in silicon single crystal material, to better device 
designs, to a better understanding of the factors that affect the 
performance of a solar cell in space. Chief among the latter, 
particularly for the mid-to-high altitude (HEO) and geosynchronous 
(GEO) orbits, are the effects of the naturally occurring particulate 
radiation environment. Although not as broadly important to the 
photovoltaic community at large as increased efficiency, the topic 
of radiation damage is critically important to use of solar cells in 
space, and is a major component of the NASA research program 
in space photovoltaics. This paper will give a brief overview of 
some of the opportunities and challenges for space photovoltaic 
applications, and will discuss some of the current reseach directed 
at achieving high efficiency and controlling the effects of radiation 
damage in space solar cells. Author

A new generation of reactors for electric power will be available 
for space missions to satisfy military and civilian needs in the 
1990s and beyond. To ensure a useful product, nuclear power 
plant development must be cognizant of other space power 
technologies. Major advances in solar and chemical lechnoiogies 
need to be considered in establishing the goals of future nuclear 
power plants. In addition, the mission needs are evolving into 
new regimes- Civilian and military power needs are forecasted to 
exceed anything used in space to date. Technology trend forecasts 
have been mapped as a function of time for solar, nuclear, 
chemical, and storage systems to illustrate areas where each 
technology provides minimum mass. Other system characteristics 
may dominate the usefulness of a technology on a given mission. 
This paper will discuss some of these factors, as well as forecast 
future military and civilian power needs and the status of

the ion forces were found to be enhanced by the large electric 
potential difference between the solar array and the plasma and 
must affect significantly the motion of spacecraft with the neutral 
particle drag. Author

A model and an algorithm are developed for the optimization 
of the performance characteristics of concentration-type solar 
photoelectric systems consisting of planar solar arrays, 
concentrator reflecting films, and supporting structures. The model 
and the algorithm make it possible to accurately predict the 
parameters of concentration-type photoelectric systems at the 
design stage. It is shown that, under conditions of considerable 
radiation-induced damage, the performance of such systems can 
be improved by using low-potential concentration systems and 
discrete reservation of output power. V.L.

The capability and the safety of manned spacecraft are largely 
dependent upon reliable electric power systems. Two similar space 
power systems able to survive the low Earth orbit environment, 
are being considered for NASA's Manned Space Station (SS), 
scheduled to begin operation in the mid 1990's. The Space Station 
Electric Power System (EPS) is composed of Photovoltaic (PV) 
Power Modules, Solar Dynamic (SD) Power Modules, and the Power 
Management and Distribution (PMAD) System. One EPS 
configuration will deliver 37.5 kW of PV based, utility grade, ac 
power to SS users. A second 75 kWe PV based EPS option is 
also being considered for SS deployment. The two EPS options 
utilize common modules and differ only in the total number of PV 
Power Modules used. Each PV Power Module supplies 18.75 kWe 
of ac power and incorporates its own energy storage and thermal 
control. The general requirements and the current preliminary 
design configuration of the Space Station PV Power Modules are 
examined. Author

A summary of the Low Earth Orbital Environment, its impact 
on the Photovoltaic Power systems of the space station and the 
solutions implemented to resolve the environmental concerns or 
issues are described. Low Earth Orbital Environment (LEO) 
presents several concerns to the Photovoltaic power systems of 
the space station. These concerns include atomic oxygen 
interaction with the polymeric substrate of the solar arrays, ionized 
environment effects on the array operating voltage, the effects of 
the meteoroids and debris impacts and penetration through the 
different layers of the solar celts and their circuits, and the high 
energy particle and radiation effects on the overall solar array 
performance. Potential solutions to some of the degrading 
environmental interactions that will provide the photovoltaic power 
system of the space station with the desired life are also 
summarized. Author

POWER AND CHARGE DISSIPATION FROM AN

The Plasma Motor-Generator project utilizes the influence of 
the geomagnetic field on a conductive tether attached to a LEO 
spacecraft to provide a reversible conversion of orbital energy 
into electrical energy. The behavior of the current into the 
ionospheric plasma under the influence of the geomagnetic field 
is of significant experimental and theoretical interest. Theoretical 
calculations are reviewed which start from Maxwell's equations 
and treat the ionospheric plasma as a linear dielectric medium. 
These calculations show a charge emitting tether moving in a 
magnetic field will generate electromagnetic waves in the plasma 
which carry the charge in the direction of the magnetic field. The 
ratio of the tether's speed to the ton cyclotron frequency which is 
about 25 m for a LEO is a characteristic length for the phenomena. 
Whereas for the dimensions of the contact plasma much larger 
than this value the waves are the conventional Alfven waves, 
when the dimensions are comparable or smaller, diffraction effects 
occur similar to those associated with Fresnel diffraction in optics. 



The power required to excite these waves for a given tether current 
is used to estimate the impedance associated with this mode of 
charge dissipation. Author

A life cycle model of a typical space power system (SPS) in 
the first half of the next century is described. Inputs for this logistics 
model are: life cycle duration (100 yr); power level of the SPS at 
the end of life cycle assumed (500 GW); power level for single 
SPS unit (5 GW); availability of space power units (90 %); and 
specific mass (Mg/MW) of SPS as a function of time. A system 
of 100 operating space power units in geostationary orbit with an 
output of 500 GW in its 50th year requires in this year a total 
mass flow of 200,000 T. To operate the system, a crew size in 
GEO is 600 people. The total mass installed in the SPS is 6 
million metric tons. To transport this material to the GEO from 
Earth and from the Moon, average annual launch rates of 300 for 
the lunar bus and 340 for the heavy lift launch vehicle during the 
50 yr time period are required. The average annual output of the 
SPS is economically attractive: 2188 TWh at 7.4 mills/kWh.

Plasma contactors are proposed as a means of making good 
electrical contact between biased surfaces such as found at the 
ends of an electrodynamic tether and the space environment. 
The plasma contactor emits a plasma cloud which facilitates the 
electrical connection. The physics of this plasma cloud is 
investigated for contactors used as electron collectors. The central 
question addressed is whether the electrons collected by a plasma 
contactor come from the far field or by ionization of local neutral 
gas. This question is important because the system implications 
are different for the two mechanisms. It is shown that contactor 
clouds in space will consist of a spherical core possibly containing 
a shock wave. Outside of the core the cloud will expand 
anisotropically across the magnetic field leading to a turbulent 
cigar shape structure along the field. This outer region is itself 
divided into two regions by the ion response to the electric field. 
A two-dimensional theory for the outer regions of the cloud is 
developed. The current voltage characteristic of an Argon plasma 
contactor cloud is estimated for several ion currents in the range 
of 1 to 100 Amperes. It is suggested that the major source of 
collected electrons comes by ionization of neutral gas while 
collection of electrons from the far field is relatively small.

Solar dynamic power generation has been selected by NASA 
to provide power for the space station. Solar dynamic concentrator 
technology has been demonstrated for terrestrial applications but 
has not been developed for space applications. The object of the 
Solar Concentrator Advanced Development program is to develop 
the technology of solar concentrators which would be used on 
the space station. The first task of this program was to develop 
conceptual concentrator designs and perform trade-off studies and 
to develop a materials data base and perform material selection. 
Three unique concentrator concepts; Truss Hex, Spline Radial 
Panel and Domed Fresnel, were developed and evaluated against 
weighted trade criteria. The Truss Hex concept was recommended 
for the space station. Materials data base development 
demonstrated that several material systems are capable of 
withstanding extended periods of atomic oxygen exposure without 
undesirable performance degradation. Descriptions of the 
conceptual designs and materials test data are included. Author

The coaxial tube array tether/transmission line used to connect 
an SP-100 nuclear power system to the space station was 
characterized over the range of reactor-to-platform separation 
distances of 1 to 10 km. Characterization was done with respect 
to array performance, physical dimensions and masses. Using a 
fixed design procedure, a family of designs was generated for the 
same power level (300 kWe), power loss (1.5 percent), and 
meteoroid survival probability (99.5 percent over 10 yr). To 
differentiate between vacuum insulated and gas insulated lines, 
two different maximum values of the E field were considered: 20 
kV/cm (appropriate to vacuum insulation) and 50 kV/cm 
(compressed SF6). Core conductor, tube, bumper, standoff, spacer 



and bumper support dimensions, and masses were also calculated. 
The results of the characterization show mainly how transmission 
line size and mass scale with reactor-to-platform separation 
distance. Author

Data taken on the SCATHA satellite at geosynchronous altitudes 
during periods of electron beam ejection in sunlight showed that 
the potential difference between an electrically isolated boom and 
the satellite main body was a function of beam current, energy, 
and boom-sun angle. The potential difference decreased as the 
boom area illuminated by the sun increased; the maximum and 
minimum potential differences were measured when minimum and 
maximum boom areas, respectively, were exposed to the sun. It

is shown that photoelectrons, created on the boom, could be 
engulfed in the electrostatic field of the highly charged satellite 
main body. Theoretical calculations made using a simple current 
balance model showed that these electrons could provide a 
substantial discharging current to the main body and cause the 
observed variations in the potential difference between the main 
body and the booms. Author

This paper deals with the prediction of deployment dynamics, 
antenna vibration characteristics, and reliability evaluation related 
to an antenna deployment mechanism (ADM) necessary for large 
satellite antenna development. A statistical analysis is proposed 
to predict the deployment dynamics of an antenna based on the 
driving and friction torques of mechanical parts whose statistical 
distributions are fitted to normal distributions. The effect of ADM 
bending stiffness on antenna natural frequencies was studied 
analytically to establish a guideline for determination of the ADM 
bending stiffness. The first natural frequency of the antenna was 
lessened by 5 Hz due to the effect of ADM bending stiffness. A 
procedure is proposed to evaluate the reliability of the ADM.

A communication payload to be embarked on the Polar Platform 
of the Columbus program, to provide mobile communications 



services to the polar areas was defined. The time visibility 
constraints typical of the low altitude orbit of the platform are 
experienced by users and therefore limit the possibilities of real 
time operation. However, mail box type communications may be 
successfully implemented. The system architecture for a low orbit 
polar platform and the criteria for real time and mail box operations 
were derived. The system architecture includes the Earth segment 
and the in-orbit system. Problems relevant to the real viability of 
the in-orbit system were investigated, defining the service operation 
conditions and the communications transponder layout. The user 
terminal architecture was assessed to demonstrate overall program 
feasibility. ESA

A two-step approach to wavefront sensing for the Large 
Deployable Reflector (LDR) was examined as part of an effort to 
define wavefront-sensing requirements and to determine particular 
areas for more detailed study. A Hartmann test for coarse 
alignment, particularly segment tilt, seems feasible if LDR can 
operate at 5 microns or less. The direct measurement of the 
point spread function in the diffraction limited region may be a 
way to determine piston error, but this can only be answered by 
a detailed software model of the optical system. The question of 
suitable astronomical sources for either test must also be 
addressed. M.G.

An Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) crewmember had two-way 
communications with the space station in the Ku-band frequency 
(12 to 18 GHz). The maximum range of the EVA communications 
link with the space station is approximately one kilometer for 
nominal values for transmitter power, antenna gains, and receiver 
noise figure. The EVA Communications System, that will continue 
to function regardless of the astronaut's position and orientation, 
requires an antenna system that has full spherical coverage. Three 
or more antennas that can be flush mounted on the astronaut's 
space suit (EMU) and/or his propulsive backpack (MMU), will be 
needed to provide the desired coverage. As the astronaut moves 
in the space station, the signal received by a given EVA antenna 
changes. An automatic antenna switching system is needed that 
will switch the communication system to the antenna with the 
largest signal strength. A design for automatic antenna switching 
is presented and discussed. Author

The dimensional stability of the surface of a large reflector 
antenna is important when high gain or low sidelobe performance 
is desired. If the surface is distorted due to thermal or structural 
reasons, antenna performance can be improved through the use 
of an array feed. The design of the array feed and its relation to 
the surface distortion are examined. The sensitivity of antenna 
performance to changing surface parameters for fixed feed array 



geometries is also studied. This allows determination of the limits 
of usefulness for feed array compensation. Author

The paper presents the necessary conditions for the minimum 
fuel, time-free transfer between two noncoplanar elliptical orbits. 
It is shown that the solution is obtained by solving a system of 
three nonlinear equations for three unknowns. The case where 
the impulses are applied along the line of nodes is discussed. In 
general, this nodal transfer is nonoptimal, but the characteristic 
velocity for the best nodal transfer, called the minimizing nodal 
transfer, is reasonably close to the one for the optimal transfer 
for it to be useful as a substitute for a practical transfer. 
Furthermore, when the relative position of the two terminal orbits 
is varied, the two characteristic velocities, for the minimizing nodal 
transfer and the optimal transfer, exhibit the same trend in the 
sense that they pass through their maxima and minima at nearly 
the same relative position. This makes the set of explicit formulas 
for computing the minimizing nodal transfer, as presented in this 
paper, a useful tool for designing a minimum fuel transfer between 
several orbits. Author

The ideal propulsion system for the manned journey from earth

high specific impulse; it is presently suggested that only fusion 
power can maximize both of these parameters to the point where 
the interplanetary journey in question can be made in several 
days rather than, as at present, several months. A vehicle 
accelerating at 1g half of the way to Mars, and then decelerating 
at the same rate for the remainder of the journey, would require 
a fusion power plant of 1-terawatt output, or three orders of 
magnitude greater than the 1-gigawatt output of the largest 
terrestrial fission powerplants. O.C.

Life tests were conducted on a 22-N (5-lb) hydrazine rocket 
thruster which incorporates the latest technology to obtain long 
life from the catalyst bed. A spring mechanism surrounding the 
catalyst bed continually applies compression to the catalyst bed 
to prevent the formation of any void channels. The research rocket 
thruster was tested over an operational cycle of both steady state 
and pulse firing which simulated a possible space station duty 
cycle. The thruster ran as expected for about 40 hours, or 3.2 
times 10 to the 6th power N-sec (7.2 times 10 to the 5th power 
lb-sec) total impulse. Subsequently, some thrust chamber pressure 
decreases were noted during long steady state test periods. After 
60.2 hours of run time, tests had to be terminated due to a blockage 
in the propellant injector tube which occurred during heatinc J 
the thruster by a heat lamp. A chemical analysis of the catai, t 
indicated that iron and nickel metals had poisoned some of ti 
catalyst, thereby causing a degradation in performance. If was 



determined that a contaminated barrel of hydrazine was the source 
of the metal poisoning. Author

A brief summary of some of the important physical processes 
involved in low gravity combustion is given. While the discussion 
is generally limited to the processes involved in the combustion 
of continuous, solid, nonmetallic fuels, much of the reasoning 
presented can be applied to other fuel types and configurations.

Tests in which metals were rubbed against themselves in oxygen 
have revealed that increasing oxygen pressure does not always 
increase the potential for ignition. It is believed that there exists a 
specific pressure above which convective heat loss due to higher 
oxygen density will overcome the potential increase in the oxidation 
rate afforded by the increase in oxygen pressure. Test results 
have shown that, once a specific oxygen pressure is exceeded, 
greater rates of frictional energy were required for ignition of metals 
as pressure is increased. Other test results have indicated that as 
oxygen pressure is increased during the rubbing process, the bulk 
sample equilibrium temperatures decrease. These results support 
the belief that increases in convective heat loss as pressure is 
increased can raise the energy requirements for ignition of metals 
or lower their ignition potentials. Testing has also indicated that, 
when metals were exposed to a rubbing process and oxygen 
pressure was increased, metals such as carbon steel exhibited a 
decrease in their bulk ignition temperatures, whereas metals such 
as Monel showed bulk ignition temperatures independent of 
pressure. Author

these requirements is limited. Dispersion-strengthened platinum 
was selected. Past results indicated that it should be suffieiently 
inert in candidate propellent environments and should be capable 
of operating at moderate temperatures for extended periods. A 
series of propellant compatibility tests was done with platinum 
strengthened with either yttria or zirconia. Data presented included 
the results of 1000-hr tests in C02, H2, ammonia {NH3), N2. 
steam, hydrazine (N2H4), and methane (CH4); and 2000-hr tests 
in H2 and NH3. The plaiinum samples were tested at 1400 C in 
C02, H2, NH3, N2, steam, and N2H4; at 500 C in CH4; and at 
800 C in N2H4. The mass-loss results indicated material life, 
exptrapolated from experimental mass-loss data, in excess of 100 
000 hr in all environments except steam and N2H4, where it was 
greater than or =45000 hr Generally, on the basis of mass loss, 
there were no compatibility concerns in any of the environments 
considered. Optical and scanning electron microscopy were used 
to determine the effect of propellants on the material surface and 
to evaluate material stability. Author

A conceptual design study of the resistojet orbital replacement 
unit (ORU) was conducted. The ORU consists of four 500-W 
multipropellant resistojets, fluid components downstream of the 
waste fluid storage subsystem, a power controller, structure, and 
micrometeorite shielding. The fluid components include latch 
valves, a water vaporizer, two pressure regulators or flow control 
valves, filters, check valves, fluid tubing, and interface couplings. 
Separate fluid components are provided for oxidizing fluids, 
reducing fluids and water. Different flow and power control methods 
were studied. The most promising methods consist of a constant 
pressure/on-off power control and a constant power/variable 
pressure control. The closed-loop power control incorporates a 
feedback signal which is proportional to resistojet heater 
temperature. Author

The objective was to prepare for the design of the space 
station propulsion system. Propulsion system concepts were 
defined and schematics were developed for the most viable 
concepts. A dual model bipropellant system was found to deliver 
the largest amount of payload. However, when resupply is 
considered, an electrolysis system with 10 percent accumulators 
requires less resupply propellant, though it is penalized by the 
amount of time required to fill the accumulators and the power 
requirements for the electrolyzer. A computer simulation was 
prepared, which was originally intended to simulate the water 
electrolysis propulsion system but which was expanded to model 
other types of systems such as cold gas, monopropellant and 
bipropellant storable systems. J.P.B.

Presented are the results of the cost analysis performed to 
update and refine the program phase C/D cost estimates for a 
Shuttle Derived Vehicle (SDV) tanker. The SDV tanker concept is 
an unmanned cargo vehicle incorporating a set of propellant tanks 
in the vehicle's payload module. The tanker will be used to meet 
the demand for a cryogenic propellant supply in orbit. The propellant 
tanks are delivered to a low Earth orbit or to an orbit in the 
vicinity of the Space Station. The intent of the economic analysis 
is to provide NASA with economic justification for the propellant 
scavenging concept that minimizes the total Space Transportation 
System life cycle cost. The detailed costs supporting the concept

The engineering model resistojet intended for altitude 
maintenance onboard the space station was tested for magnetic 
radiation emissions in the Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) 
facility at the Goddard Space Flight Center. The resistojet heater 
was supplied with power at 20 kHz and low voltage through a 
power controller. The resistojet was isolated from its power supply 
in the RFI enclosure, and the magnetic emission measured at 
three locations around the resistojet at various heater currents. At 
a heater current of 18.5 A the maximum magnetic emission was 
61 dBpt at a distance of 1 m from the resistojet and at a location 
at the rear of the thruster. Calculations indicate that the case and 
heat shields provided a minimum of 4 dB of attenuation at a 
current of 18.5 A. Maximum radiation was measured at the rear 
of the resistojet along its major axis and was thought to be due 
to the magnetic radiation from the power leads. At a distance of 
37 cm from the resistojet the maximum magnetic radiation 
measured was 73 dBpt at a current of 11.2 A. The power input 
leads were also a source of magnetic radiation. The engineering 
model rssistojet requires about 20 dB of additional shielding.

A semiautonomous telerobotic system for satellite servicing that 
incorporates a number of advanced technologies has been 
developed. The system features structured supervisory control 
software that guides the operator through a step-by-step script 
and gracefully accommodates transitions between manual and 
automatic control. Other major features include voice input/output 
for both camera and robot control, model-based path planning, 
shared control with active compliance, and a two-actuator standard 
integrated connector. These features will allow a single operator 
to control the exchange of an orbital replacement unit from a 
remote location. Demonstrations of the system in June 1987 at 
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center all resulted in the flawless 
performance of a simulated orbital replacement unit exchange.

Recent design activities for the International Space Station have 
included studies of the operations and productivity of the U.S. 
Laboratory module. A major finding was that the most limited 
resource on the Station will be crew time. A ground-controlled 
robot has been proposed that will help alleviate these constraints 
and allow around-the-clock U.S. Laboratory operations. However, 
the ground control of a mechanism in earth orbit imposes command 
and feedback delays because of the distance and communications 
network involved. A unique predictive display for use by the ground 
operator in the presence of varying time delays has been developed 
and tested and has reduced the 'move-and-wait' task times 
normally associated with delayed feedback teleoperations, 
minimized operator training, and reduced downlink bandwidth 
required. Author

An aggressive program has been initiated to develop, integrate, 
and implement autonomous systems technologies starting with 
today's expert systems and evolving to autonomous, intelligent 
systems by the end of the 1990s. This program includes core 
technology developments and demonstration projects for 
technology evaluation and validation. This paper discusses key 
operational frameworks in the content of systems autonomy 
applications and then identifies major technological challenges, 
primarily in artificial intelligence areas. Program content and 
progress made towards critical technologies and demonstrations 
that have been initiated to achieve the required future capabilities 
in the year 2000 era are discussed. Author

The aim of this study was to review existing design techniques 
for robots on the matter of their applicability for the design and 
development of a space manipulator system. Attention is paid to 
the definition and the design approach of the overall control system. 
Special emphasis is given to the control elements dealing with 
task-definition, path construction, and on-board control. Also, a 
number of on-board implementation aspects are considered. 
Furthermore, a comparison is made with the Remote Manipulator 
Control, as used on the Space Shuttle. Author

The Stanford University Aerospace Robotics Laboratory is 
actively developing and experimentally testing advanced robot 
control strategies for space robotic applications. Early experiments 
focused on control of very lightweight one-link manipulators and 
other flexible structures. The results are being extended to position 
and force control of mini-manipulators attached to flexible 
manipulators and multilink manipulators with flexible drive trains. 
Experimental results show that end-point sensing and careful 
dynamic modeling or adaptive control are key to the success of 
these control strategies. Free-flying space robot simulators that 
operate on an air cushion table have been built to test control

laboratory-based research testbed, and will show proof-of-concept 
for supervised automation of space assembly, servicing, and repair 
operations. The demonstrator system features a hierarchically 
layered intelligent control architecture which enables automated 
planning and run-time sequencing of complex tasks by a 
supervisory human operator. The demonstrator also provides a 
full bilateral force-reflecting hand control teleroperations capability. 
The operator may switch smoothly between the automated and

ROBOTS - AUTONOMOUS SPACE WORKERS 

D. R. SLOGGETT Space (ISSN 0267-954X), vol. 3, Nov.-Dec. 
1987, p. 6-10. 

Crew safety, increased capability, and productivity drive the 
potential applications for robots in space. Enhanced astronaut 
safety, due to the reduced need for EVA, coupJed with the ability 
to deal safely with malfunctions that cause hazardous conditions 
in the vicinity of the failed equipment are the main goals of using 
robots in space. In order to operate in space, the robots must be 
hardened against high energy particles, small meteorites, and 
radiation. NASA-sponsored work has shown the need to support 
features such as gross and dexterous manipulation, handling 
flexible objects, execution of 'learned' sequences, and multiarm 
operations. The use of intelligent robots on the Space Station is 
discussed. K.K.

DAISY-DAMP is a prototype of an avant-garde electrical power 
control system. Although the system is still in the early stages of 
its development a number of interesting design characteristics are 
beginning to emerge. Two of the most significant of these features 
are discussed here. The first has to do with the structure of the 
system as a set of cooperating agents. The second has to do 
with the utility, in this domain, of a developmental testbed as a 
tool for exploring the relevant design space. The utilization of 
testbeds to explore the potential applicability of recent advances 
in temporal reasoning and machine learning to subsystem control 
problems of this sort is also discussed. Author

IMPACT OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS ON SPACE STATION

Supervisory control tasks define a new set of requirements for 
Space Station MMI design: (1) multifunction display and control 
hardware; (2) displays that enhance the crew persons' 'mental 
model' of invisible processes; (3) highly supportive man-machine 
dialog, including special features to support dialog with expert 
systems; (4) incorporation of machine intelligence into the MMI 
itself to provide a seemingly uniform interface to numerous 
processes, data bases, and expert systems; and (5) electronic 
documentation. A discussion of these concepts is illustrated by 
examples from recent MMI designs, including a multifunction display 
and control system developed for the Space Shuttle, an MMI 
system developed for NASA JSC for the Space Station 
environmental control and life support system, AT02 - an intelligent 
interface system, and VIMAD - an electronic documentation system 
for maintenance procedures. Author

The domains most amenable to techniques based on artificial 
intelligence (Al) are those that are systematic or for which a 
systematic domain can be generated. In aerospace systems, many 
operational tasks are systematic owing to the highly procedural 
nature of the applications. However, aerospace applications can 
also be nonprocedural, particularly in the event of a failure or an 
unexpected event. Several techniques are discussed for designing 
automated systems for real-time, dynamic environments, particularly 
when a 'breakdown' occurs. A breakdown is defined as operation 
of an automated system outside its predetermined, conceptual 
domain. Author

Current expert system technology does not permit complete 
automatic fault diagnosis; significant levels of human intervention 
are still required. This requirement dictates a need for a division 
of labor that recognizes the strengths and weaknesses of both 
human and machine diagnostic skills. Relevant findings from the 
literature on human cognition are combined with the results of 
reviews of aircrew performance with highly automated systems to 
suggest how the interface of a fault diagnostic expert system can 
be designed to assist human operators in verifying machine 
diagnoses and guiding interactive fault diagnosis. It is argued that 
the needs of the human operator should play an important role in 
the design of the knowledge base. Author

operating the device or troubleshooting its failures. The construction 
of the expert system was intensively observed and analyzed. This

A generalized master slave manipulator system which was 
assumed to operate near/or around the Space Station was 
developed. A standardized serial communication line was used 
between the master and the slave manipulator. The master 
manipulator was designed to be self-balanced to simulate operation 
under the zero-gravity condition. A force/torque reflecting bilateral 
control using the force-torque sensor settled at the wrist of the 
slave manipulator was adopted. An experiment in which the slave 
manipulator was in a vacuum chamber was performed, within 
restricted sight of cameras set up in the chamber. The problems 
which would result from adopting a generalized master slave 
manipulator system were almost solved, except for the delay 
caused by the calculation time. Author

As man seeks to expand his dominion into new environments, 

the demand increases for machines that perform useful functions 



in remote locations. This new concept for manipulation in space 
is based on knowledge and experience gained from manipulator 
systems developed to meet the needs of remote nuclear 
applications. It merges the best characteristics of teleoperation 
and robotic technologies. This paper summarizes the report of a 
study performed for NASA Langley Research Center. The design 
goals for the telerobot, a mechanical description, and technology 
areas that must be addressed for successful implementation will 
be presented and discussed. The concept incorporates mechanical 
traction drives, redundant kinematics, and modular arm 
subelements to provide a backlash-free manipulator capable of 
obstacle avoidance. Further development of this arm is in progress 
at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. DOE

Requirements for a servicing manipulator teleoperator system 
were derived using two mission model scenarios. The first scenario 
introduces the problem of communication time delays within the 
overall manipulator teleoperator control system, associated with 
the human operator being located on the ground while controlling 
a manipulator on a free-flying servicing vehicle, servicing a payload 
on a platform or satellite docked to it, in low Earth orbit The 
second scenario has the human operator located on the shuttle 
aft deck controlling a manipulator servicing a payload in the cargo 
area. This scenario is intended to demonstrate the operational 
capability of the service manipulator system using the Robotic 
Servicing Experiment. A ground based supervisor is also assumed 
for this mission, permitting a teleoperation-control experiment with 
time delay, to be performed as required. It is concluded that true 
teleoperation and control of a remote manipulator cannot be readily 
achieved in the presence of a communications time delay. ESA

The problem of cartesian trajectory control of a closed-kinematic 
chain mechanism robot manipulator with possible space station 
applications is considered. The study was performed by both 
computer simulation and experimentation for tracking of three 
different paths: a straight line, a sinusoid and a circle. Linearization 
and pole placement methods are employed to design controller 
gains. Results show that the controllers are robust and there are 
good agreements between simulation and experimentation. 
Excellent tracking quality and small overshoots are also evident.

Traditional expert systems, such as diagnostic and training 



systems, interact with users only through a keyboard and screen, 
and are usually symbolic in nature. Expert systems that require 
access to data bases, complex simulations and real-time 
instrumentation have both symbolic as well as algorithmic 
computing needs. These needs could both be met using a general 
purpose workstation running both symbolic and algorithmic code, 
or separate, specialized computers networked together. The latter 
approach was chosen to implement TEXSYS, the thermal expert 
system, developed by NASA Ames Research Center in conjunction 
with Johnson Space Center to demonstrate the ability of an expert 
system to autonomously monitor the thermal control system of 
the space station. TEXSYS has been implemented on a Symbolics

A system for reasoning about robotic assembly tasks is 
described. The first element of this system is a facility for itemizing 
the constraints which determine the admissible orderings over the 
activities to be sequenced. The second element is a facility which 
partitions the activities into independent subtasks and produces a 
set of admissible strategies for each. Finally, the system has 
facilities for constructing an admissible sequence of activities which 
is consistent with the given constraints. This can be done off-line, 
in advance of task execution, or it can be done incrementally, at 
execution time, according to conditions in the execution 
environment. The language of temporal constraints and the 
methods of inference presented in related papers are presented. 
It is shown how functional and spatial relationships between 
components impose temporal constraints on the order of assembly 
and how temporal constraints then imply admissible strategies and 
feasible sequences. Author

Manned space operations require that the many automated 
subsystems of a space platform be controllable by a limited number 
of personnel. To minimize the interaction required of these 
operators, artificial intelligence techniques may be applied to embed 
a human performance model within the automated, or 
semi-automated, systems, thereby allowing the derivation of 
operator intent. A similar application has previously been proposed 
in the domain of fighter piloting, where the demand for pilot intent 
derivation is primarily a function of limited time and higfi workload 
rather than limited operators. The derivation and propagation of 
pilot intent is presented as it might be applied to some programs.

An overview of Automation Technology Branch facilities and 
research is presented. Manipulator research includes dual-arm 
coordination studies, space manipulator dynamics, end-effector 
controller development, automatic space structure assembly, and 
the development of a dual-arm master-slave telerobotic manipulator 
system. Sensor research includes gravity-compensated force 
control, real-time monovision techniques, and laser ranging. 
Artificial intelligence techniques are being explored for supervisory 
task control, collision avoidance, and connectionist system 
architectures. A high-fidelity dynamic simulation of robotic systems, 
ROBSIM, is being supported and extended. Cooperative efforts 
with Oak Ridge National Laboratory have verified the ability of 
teleoperators to perform complex structural assembly tasks, and 
have resulted in the definition of a new dual-arm master-slave 
telerobotic manipulator. A bibliography of research results and a 
list of technical contacts are included. Author

The preliminary conceptual design of a new teleoperator robot 
manipulator system for space station maintenance missions has 
been completed. The system consists of a unique pair of arms 
that is part of a master-slave, force-reflecting servomanipulator. 
This design allows greater dexterity and greater volume coverage 
than that available in current designs and concepts. The 
teleoperator manipulator is specifically designed for space 
applications and is a valuable extension of the current 
state-of-the-art earthbound manipulators marketed today. The 
manipulator and its potential application on the space station are 
described. Author

The ACCESS truss was telerobotically assembled in order to 
gain experience with robotic assembly of hardware designed for 
astronaut extravehicular (EVA) assembly. Tight alignment 
constraints of the ACCESS hardware made telerobotic assembly 
difficult. A wider alignment envelope and a compliant end effector 
would have reduced the problem. The manipulator had no linear 
motion capability, but many of the assembly operations required 
straight line motion. The manipulator was attached to a motion 
table in order to provide the X, Y, and Z translations needed. A 



programmable robot with linear translation capability would have 
eliminated the need for the motion table and streamlined the 
assembly. Poor depth perception was a major problem. Shaded 
paint schemes and alignment lines were helpful in reducing this 
problem. The four cameras used worked well for only some 
operations. It was not possible to identify camera locations that 
worked well for all assembly steps. More cameras or movable 
cameras would have simplified some operations. The audio 
feedback system was useful. Author

A method for apportioning crew-telerobot tasks has been 
derived to facilitate the design of a crew-friendly telerobot control 
station. To identify the most appropriate state-of-the-art hardware 
for the control station, task apportionment must first be conducted 
to identify if an astronaut or a telerobot is best to execute the 
task and which displays and controls are required for monitoring 
and performance. Basic steps that comprise the task analysis 
process are: (1) identify space station tasks; (2) define tasks; (3) 
define task periformance criteria and perform task apportionment; 
(4) verify task apportionment; (5) generate control station 
requirements; (6) develop design concepts to meet requirements; 
and (7) test and verify design concepts. Author

The Flight Telerobotic Servicer (FTS), a multiple arm dexterous 
manipulation system, will aid in the assembly, maintenance, and 
servicing of the space station. Fundamental ideas and basic 
conceptual designs for a shuttle-based telerobot system have been 
produced. Recent space station studies provide additional concepts 
that should aid in the accomplishment of mission requirements. 
Currently, the FTS is in contractual source selection for a Phase 
B preliminary design. At the same time, design requirements are 
being developed through a series of robotic assessment tasks 
being performed at NASA and commercial installations. A number 
of the requirements for remote operation on the space station, 
necessary to supplement extravehicular activity (EVA), will be met 
by the FTS. Finally, technology developed for telerobotics will 
advance the state of the art of remote operating systems, enhance 
operator productivity, and prove instrumental in the evolution of 
an adaptive, intelligent autonomous robot. Author

An explanation is presented of task-level robot programming 
and of how it differs from the usual interpretation of task planning 
for robotics. Most importantly, it is argued that the physical and 
mathematical basis of task-level robot programming provides 
inherently greater reliability than efforts to apply better known 
concepts from artificial intelligence (Al) to autonomous robotics. 
Finally, an architecture is presented that allows the integration of 
task-level robot programming within an evolutionary, redundant, 
and multi-modal framework that spans teleoperation to autonomy.

Automatic in-orbit assembly of reticular structures by a 
general-purpose robot assembler is proposed. The robot can crawl 
on the structure and act on its main elements (rods, corner blocks) 
by means of a suitable manipulative system. Evaluations show 
that a two arm system (nine degrees of freedom each arm) is 
adequate. The robot can operate under sequencer control or under 
human teleoperation. The level of sensoriality is high, including 
vision capability, laser range system, proximity sensor, and 
force/torque and strain/stress sensors. The considerations 
presented are for assembling a repetitive automatizable process 
as for an industrial application. Further analyses are necessary to 
take into account all the aspects related to space environment as

The main in-orbit elements and operations required by the 
future in-orbit infrastructure are reviewed. Man's role and location 
with respect to the operations areas is a major design element 
for space teleoperation and robotics systems. It is shown that 
robotics/ teleoperation and man have to be considered as 
complementary, enabling large operational automony of the 
robotics system when man performs on-ground or remote 
supervision (e.g., from a space station). This is applicable for 
assembly (external robotics) and payload operations (internal 
robotics). Efficient and safe work share between the external 
manipulator arm and the man in pressurized area (on the same 
space system) may be an alternative to extravehicular activity (EVA) 
or preferably the nominal way to perform operations which cannot 
be fully completed by EVA only (large load transfer). The 
telemanipulator arm provides both the astronaut transfer capability 
(with loads and tools) and a firm support at work site (open cherry 
picker), increasing the effectiveness of EVA (less astronaut fatigue, 
shorter transfer time). A man in the pressurized area ensures 
supervision. ESA

The use of knowledge based systems (KBS) in space in 
sophisticated online fault management systems, having the ability 
to react appropriately to unforeseen anomalies is discussed. The 
idea appears feasible, since KBS does not depend on a 
premeditation of all possible anomalies, but on knowledge about 
the functional structure of the monitored system. However, this 
ability cannot be realized if the encoded knowledge is based on 
two-valued logic, as is the case with many KBS. Instead, it is 
shown that a knowledge representation based on multivalued logic 
is required. As a practical illustration, the behavior of an expert 
system for fault diagnosis in the cooling loop of EURECA is 
described. It is shown that multivalued logic allows for 
nonconclusive knowledge and knowledge redundancy, which 
facilitates fault tolerance of KBS in the sense of an insensitiveness 
to failures in the sensory system or faults in the knowledge base 
due to ill-coding or irradiation of computer memory. ESA

Protective coatings for graphite/epoxy (Gr/Ep) tubular 
structures for a manned Space Station truss structure were 
evaluated. The success of the composite tube truss structure 
depends on its stability to long-term exposure to the low earth 
orbit (LEO) environment, with particular emphasis placed on atomic 
oxygen. Concepts for protectively coating Gr/Ep tubes include 
use of inorganic coated metal foils and electroplating. These 
coatings were applied to Gr/Ep tubes and then subjected to 
simulated LEO environment to evaluate survivability of coatings 
and coated tubes. Evaluation included: atomic oxygen resistance, 
changes in optical properties and adhesion, abrasion resistance, 
surface preparation required, coating uniformity, and formation of 
microcracks in the Gr/Ep tubes caused by thermal cycling. Program 
results demonstrated that both phosphoric and chromic acid 
anodized Al foil provided excellent adhesion to Gr/Ep tubes and 
exhibited stable optical properties when subjected to simulated 
LEO environment. The Si02/AI coatings sputtered onto Al foils 
also resulted in an excellent protective coating. Electroplated Ni 
exhibited unacceptable adhesion loss to Gr/Ep tubes during atomic

Aerospace Engineering (ISSN 0736-2536), vol. 7, 1987, p. 60-62. 
Intercalated graphite, in fibrous form, increases the mechanical 
strength of composites by enhancing the adhesion between fibers 
and polymer matrices; the interlaminar shear strength of brominated 
carbon fiber/ epoxy composites is accordingly 18 percent greater 
than its pristine-fiber counterpart, although brominated fiber 
mechanical properties are themselves unaffected by bromination. 
Attention is presently given to the case of bromination-intercalated 
graphite flakes reinforcing a furfuryl alcohol thermosetting resin 
matrix; tensile strength is noted to be increased by 167 percent, 
and fiexural stength by 118 percent, over the unbrominated test 
samples. O.C.

OPTICAL FIBER WAVEGUIDES FOR SPACECRAFT 

APPLICATIONS 

E. J. FRIEBELE, K. L. DORSEY, and M. E. GINGERICH (U.S. 
Navy, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC) IN: Fiber

Optical fiber waveguides may be subjected to unique adverse 
environments onboard spacecraft, including wide temperature 
ranges and low dose rate radiation exposures. Since fiber reliability 
is essential, an accelerated life test has been designed to simulate 
deployment on the Space Station. The initial induced losses 
following exposure at -150 G are much lower in the fibers with 
pure silica cores than in those with doped silica cores. Good 
long-term recovery is evident at this low temperature in fibers 
which do not contain P, provided light is being transmitted in the 
waveguide, since photobleaching is the dominant recovery 
mechanism in both types of fiber at -150 G. Except for the P-doped 
waveguides, the worst-case incremental losses are extrapolated 
to be less than 10 dB/km for a 10-year, 1 rad/day exposure at 
-150 C with a -20 dBm signal in the fiber. Author

A SIMPLE MODEL FOR THE INITIAL PHASE OF A WATER 

PLASMA CLOUD ABOUT A LARGE STRUCTURE IN SPACE

Large structures in the ionosphere will outgas or eject neutral 
water and perturb the ambient neutral environment. This water 
can undergo charge exchange with the ambient oxygen ions and 
form a water plasma cloud. Additionally, water dumps or thruster 
firings can create a water plasma cloud. A simple model for the 
evolution of a water plasma cloud about a large space structure 
is obtained. It is shown that if the electron density around a large 
space structure is substantially enhanced above the ambient 
density then the plasma cloud will move away from the structure. 
As the cloud moves away it will become unstable and will eventually 
break up into filaments. A true steady state will exist only if the 
total electron density is unperturbed from the ambient density. 
When the water density is taken to be consistent with Shuttle 
based observations the cloud is found to slowly drift away on a 
timescale of many tens of milliseconds. This time is consistent 
with the Shuttle observations. Author

Diffusion and outgassing of contaminants in spacecraft 
composite structures are evaluated. The generalized mass and 
heat transfer equations are simplified for application to thin 
platforms, and a mathematical model is constructed for predicting 
outgassing rates as a function of orbital temperatures. It is found 
that small changes in temperature can have a major influence on 
the time needed for a structure to reach a specified level of residual 
contamination. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate 
application of the theory, and recommendations are given for testing 
and for monitoring orbital temperatures. Author

An atomic oxygen exposure facility was developed for studies 
of material degradation. The goal of these studies is to provide 
design criteria and information for the manufacture of long life (20 
to 30 years) construction materials for use in low Earth orbit. The 
studies that are being undertaken will provide: (1) absolute reaction 
cross sections for the engineering design problems, (2) formulations 
of reaction mechanisms for use in the selection of suitable existing 
materials and the design of new more resistant ones, and (3) the 
calibration of flight hardware (mass spectrometers, etc.) in order 
to directly relate experiments performed in low Earth orbit to ground 
based investigations. The facility consists of a CW laser sustained 
discharge source of O-atoms, an atomic beam formation and 
diagnostics system, a spinning rotor viscometer, and provision for 
using the system for calibration of actual flight instruments.

Degradation was explored of various materials used in 
aerospace vehicles after severe loss of polymeric material coatings 
(Kapton) was observed on an early shuttle flight in low Earth 
orbit. Since atomic oxygen is the major component of the 
atmosphere at 300 km, and the shuttle's orbital velocity produced 
relative motion corresponding to approx. 5 eV of oxygen energy, 
it was natural to attribute much of this degradation to oxygen 
interaction. This assumption was tested using large volume vacuum 
systems and ion beam sources, in an exploratory effort to produce 
atomic oxygen of the appropriate energy, and to observe mass 
loss from various samples as well as optical radiation. Several 
investigations were initiated and the results of these investigations 
are presented in four papers. These papers are summarized. They 
are entitled: (1) The Space Shuttle Glow; (2) Laboratory 
Degradation of Kapton in a Low Energy Oxygen Ion Beam; (3)

techniques to CAA 25 ft lengths of Al foil; developing bonding 
processes for wrapping the Al foil to graphite/epoxy tubes; and 
atomic oxygen testing of the CAA Al foil. Two specifications were

Polymer-matrix composites have considerable potential for use 
in the construction of orbiting structures such as the space station 
and space antennas because of their light weight, high strength, 
and low thermal expansion. However, they can suffer surface 
erosion by interaction with atomic oxygen in low-Earth orbit and 
degradation and/or embrittlement by electrons and ultraviolet 
radiation especially in geosynchronous orbit. Thus, a study of the 
effect of these environmental hazards on polymeric materials is 
an important step in the assessment of such materials for future 
use in space. Author

Polymeric materials that may be exposed on spacecraft to the 
hostile environment beyond Earth's atmosphere were subjected 
to atomic oxygen, electron bombardment, and ultraviolet radiation 
in terrestrial experiments. Evidence is presented for the utility of 
an inexpensive asher for determining the relative susceptibility of 
organic polymers to atomic oxygen. Kapton, Ultem, PI 700 
polysulfone, and m-CBB/BIS-A (a specially formulated polymer 
prepared at NASA Langley) all eroded at high rates, just as was 
observed in shuttle experiments. Films of Ultem, P1700 polysulfone, 
and m-CBB/BIS-A were irradiated with 85 keV electrons. The 
UV/VIS absorbance of Ultem was found to decay with time after 
irradiation, indicating free radical decay. The tensile properties of 
Ultem began to change only after it had been exposed to 100 
Mrads. The effects of dose rate, temperature, and simultaneous 
vs. sequential electron and UV irradiation were also studied.

Fiberglass-epoxy composites are considered for use as 
structural members for the mast of the space station solar array 
panel. The low Earth orbital environment in which space station 
is to operate is composed mainly of atomic oxygen, which has 
been shown to cause erosion of many organic materials and some 
metals. Ground based testing in a plasma asher was performed 
to determine the extent of degradation of fiberglass-epoxy 
composites when exposed to a simulated atomic oxygen 
environment. During exposure, the epoxy at the surface of the 
composite was oxidized, exposing individual glass fibers which 
could easily be removed. Several methods of protecting the 
composite were evaluated in an atomic oxygen environment and 
with thermal cycling and flexing. The protection techniques 
evaluated to date include an aluminum braid covering, an indium-tin 
eutectic and a silicone based paint. The open aluminum braid 
offered little protection while the CV-1144 coating offered some 
initial protection against atomic oxygen, but appears to develop 
cracks which accelerate degradation when flexed. Coatings such 
as the In-Sn eutectic may provide adequate protection by containing 
the glass fibers even though mass loss still occurs. Author

1987, p. 30-34. 

The Polar Platform of the NASA Space Station will be a highly 
complex data collection system with transmission rates placing 
large burdens on the ground segment in terms of data processing, 
dissemination, and archiving. The candidate areas for onboard 
instrument processing are data compression, bulk correction, image 
interpretation, and supporting instrumentation. The major task of 
onboard processing should be transmission bandwidth reduction 
which can be achieved most efficiently via data compression.

A PACKETISED REMOTE VISUAL ACCESS DATA SYSTEM 

FOR SPACE STATION INTERACTIVE PAYLOAD OPERATIONS 

R. P. CARVELL (Imperial College of Science and Technology, 
London, England) Acta Astronautica (ISSN 0094-5765), vol. 15, 
Sept. 1987, p. 651-659. refs 

Potential users of the pressurized Columbus elements, (the 
Attached Pressurized Module and the Man-Tended Free Flyer), 
were consulted in order to establish the requirements necessary 
to achieve effective and efficient remote interactive payload 
operations. These are briefly described and clearly indicate that 
the key to such operations is a versatile remote visual access 
(video) system which is well-tuned to the requirements of the 
users in both the on-board and ground segments. A packetized 
remote visual access data system is proposed which 
accommodates these requirements and offers a very flexible 
operational environment. It incorporates a scheme for optimizing 
users' remote visual access to their experiments. Methods of 
implementing the necessary multiplexing and compression aspects 
of the system are discussed. A scheme for centralized on-board 
monitoring, which is complicated by the wide range of video sources 
required by the users, is outlined and aspects of the ground 
segment, in particular the problem of link delays, are considered.

The design characteristics of the Columbus payload data base 
(CPDB) prototype version installed at ESA/ESTEC and DFVLR 
are discussed, with special consideration given to the data design, 
user interface, communication within the user community, and 
integrability. Attention is also given to the analysis of the data 
requirements and the functional requirements. First experiences 
with the CPDB showed that it is a valuable tool in the process of 
payload definition for the elements of the Columbus program. The 
built-in growth potential of the system and its well-defined interfaces 
allow for its integration into a net of international information 
systems, which will be necessary in Phase C/D of the Columbus

Based on generic operational and computational requirements 
associated with the control of telerobots in earth orbit, a 
multibus-based distributed but integrated computing architecture 
is proposed. An experimental system of that kind under 
development at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is briefly 
described. It uses Intel Multibus I at both control station and remote 
robot (telerobot) computing nodes. An essential element within 
each multibus is a Unified (or Universal) Computer Control 
Subsystem (UCCS) for telerobot and control station motor 
components. The two multibus-based computing nodes can be 
linked by parallel or high speed serial links for real-time data 
transmission and for closing the real-time bilateral (force-reflecting) 
control loop between telerobot and control station. The 
experimental system is briefly commented, followed by a brief 
discussion of future development plans and possibilities. Author

The evolution of data processing concepts is reviewed with 
reference to the experience gained from the development of 
Spacelab and its utilization, the ongoing development of the Eureca 
system, and the present design and specification phase of 
Columbus. It is noted that the development of special architectures, 
interfaces, and protocols should be avoided and performed only if 
existing commercially available solutions cannot be used. The 
architecture design should provide for efficient accommodation of 
technology progress. The need for powerful simulations not only 
for early testing but also for in-depth and efficient assessment 
and monitoring of the data processing system performance is 
emphasized. V.L.

The Space Station Program (SSP) requires a system that has 
many safety critical resources that must be kept secure. The Space 
Station Information System (SSIS) is defined as the integrated set 
of space and ground data and information networks which provide 
required data and information services to the flight crew, ground 
operations personnel, and the customer community. It includes as 
its elements not only flight element systems such as the onboard 
data management, communications and tracking systems; but also 
existing and planned institutional systems such as the NASA 
Communications Systems (NASCOM), the Tracking and Data Relay 
Satellite System (TDRSS) and the data and communications 
networks of the scientific and industrial users and the international 
partners. The SSIS (1986) is conceived to support the full range 
of users in all operations of their subsystems or experiments that 
involve data handling, processing and/or storage regardless of 
where physically each user is located. Author

NASA's Office of Space Science and Applications (OSSA) gave 
a select group of scientists the opportunity to test and implement 
their computational algorithms on the Massively Parallel Processor 
(MPP) located at Goddard Space Flight Center, beginning in late 
1985. One year later, the Working Group presented its report, 
which addressed the following: algorithms, programming languages, 
architecture, programming environments, the way theory relates, 
and performance measured. The findings point to a number of 
demonstrated computational techniques for which the MPP 
architecture is ideally suited. For example, besides executing much 
faster on the MPP than on conventional computers, systolic VLSI 
simulation (where distances are short), lattice simulation, neural 
network simulation, and image problems were found to be easier 
to program on the MPP's architecture than on a CYBER 205 or 
even a VAX. The report also makes technical recommendations 
covering all aspects of MPP use, and recommendations concerning 
the future of the MPP and machines based on similar architectures, 
expansion of the Working Group, and study of the role of future 
parallel processors for space station, EOS, and the Great 
Observatories era. Author

Orbital transfer vehicle and deep space probe missions were 
analyzed to identify the requirements of a target Data Handling 
Subsystem (DHS). Fault tolerant techniques were assessed to 
catalog the fault tolerant features especially applicable for space 
use. Transient faults due to heavy ion induced single event upsets 
were emphasized, because of their very large influence on space 
applications. Candidate solutions were analyzed and synthesized 
into a design architecture of the Target DHS. The fault tolerant 
features of the Target DHS are found to reside in a central on 
board computer. Two DHS architectures were established, one 
for each mission. The different requirements of dependability led 
to different architectures of the fault tolerant computers. ESA

The communications system for the space station will require 
a space based multiple access component to provide 
communications between the space based program elements and 
the station. A study was undertaken to investigate two of the 
concerns of this multiple access system, namely, the issues related 
to the frequency spectrum utilization and the possibilities for higher 
order (than QPSK) modulation schemes for use in possible 
modulators and demodulators (modems). As a result of the 



investigation, many key questions about the frequency spectrum 
utilization were raised. At this point, frequency spectrum utilization 
is seen as an area requiring furtner work. Simulations were 
conducted using a computer aided communications system design 
package to provide a straw man modem structure to be used for 
both QPSK and 8-PSK channels. Author

Quality of software not only is vital to the successful operation 
of the space station, it is also an important factor in establishing 
testing requirements, time needed for software verification and 
integration as well as launching schedules for the space station. 
Defense of management decisions can be greatly strengthened 
by combining engineering judgments with statistical analysis. Unlike 
hardware, software has the characteristics of no wearout and costly 
redundancies, thus making traditional statistical analysis not 
suitable in evaluating reliability of software. A statistical model 
was developed to provide a representation of the number as well 
as types of failures occur during software testing and verification. 
From this model, quantitative measure of software reliability based 
on failure history during testing are derived. Criteria to terminate 
testing based on reliability objectives and methods to estimate 
the expected number of fixings required are also presented.

knowledge was supported by a knowledge specification formalism 
proposed by the knowledge engineers to the domain experts for 
the preliminary acquisition of all the information considered useful

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has 
developed a globally-distributed complex of earth resources data 
bases since LANDSAT 1 was launched in 1972. NASA envisages 
considerable growth in the number, extent, and complexity of such 
data bases, due to the improvements expected in its remote 
sensing data rates, and the increasingly multidisciplinary nature of 
its scientific investigations. Work already has begun on information 
systems to support multidisciplinary research activities based on 
data acquired by the space station complex and other space-based 
and terrestrial sources. In response to a request from NASA's 



former Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, 
the National Research Council convened a committee in June 
1985 to identify the critical issues involving information systems 
support to space science and applications. The committee has 
suggested that OSSA address four major information systems 
issues; centralization of management functions, interoperability of 
user involvement in the planning and implementation of its 
programs, and technology. GRA

Since the inception of the Space Station Customer Logistics 
Study, it became apparent that a modeling process was needed 
to provide insight into the many sensitivities and relationships which 
exist among the numerous variables which impact Space Station 
customer accommodations and logistics support requirements with 
regard to their associated design requirements. This paper 
addresses the current design and operations of the Space Station, 
with emphasis on the Manufacturing and Technology Laboratory 
(MTL) which is the primary focus of the study and the model. 
Typical experiments planned for the MTL are addressed as well 
as their on-orbtt operational and logistical requirements. A detailed 
description of the model developed under the study along with 
some of its many applications for scoping Space Station logistics 
requirements is presented. Author

The efforts of a commercial space venture in creating a manned 
space station testbed based in the Shuttle are described. It is 
creating a near-term pressurized equipment test bed module and 
developmental scenario for Space Station with private financing. 
The Spacehab Module research capability simulating the Space 
Station interior environment will be available 3-5 yrs before IOC. 
The Spacehab Module has created a low-cost, lower-risk 
development scenario for the commercial customer at Space 
Station through a Space Station Simulation Module. The Spacehab 
Module is to be fabricated for later attachment to the Space Station, 
to provide an evolutionary research capability in orbit, to evolve 
as the industry and station hardware emerge, and to provide 
cost-effective service through a private space commercialization 
organization. Author

Of principal importance to the U.S./lnternational Space Station 
(US/ISS) is the opportunity to exploit the microgravity environment 
for studies related to materials science and technology, 
fundamental physics and chemistry in a low-g environment, and 
the conduct of a variety of life science investigations. Unlike the 
Soviet Mir space station, the US/ISS has been designed for 
extensive externally attached payloads; its platforms include 
elements in polar orbit and coorbital with the core station. The 
possibility of a Shuttle launched and Shuttle visited multiuser 
platform is discussed as well as the possible development of a 
Space Station module capable of substantial free-flying 
operations. K.K.

Key areas of space technology in which Europe will eventually 
want independent parallel capability are identified. The paper 
presents study of potential routes to this end. A key issue lies in 
the operational costs associated with permanent in-orbit facilities. 
These costs must be reduced if the construction of a permanent 
Space Infrastructure is not to freeze the available European budget 
and inhibit further developments. There is an intimate relationship 
between the operational costs of a Space Station and that of the 
space transportation system supporting it, and the two must be 
developed as a related package. The development of an 
independent European capability could encourage effective 
European participation in more advanced international Space 
programs in the 21st century. Author

Ways of reducing the costs of future experiments in the Space

cost categories: hardware development, production, and 
preparation for flight; launch, including supply of consumables; 
crew services; operations; and communications between the 
various ground centers. To limit the costs of performing experiments 
in space, it is recommended that the users avoid complex hardware 
design, use as much common components as possible, design 
for light weight and low power consumption, and maximize 
automation and teleoperation. V.L.

This paper discusses the approach to Space Station evolution 
planning and the preliminary analysis of options for the evolution 
of the infrastructure. The approach emphasizes the analysis of 
evolution paths, driven by specific user requirements, and evolution 
modes, i.e., the infrastructure required to support the evolution 
paths. The objective is to determine the near-term actions that 
must be taken to protect the future options. These include the 
identification of evolution 'hooks and scars' on the baseline Space 
Station and the establishment of an evolution advanced 
development program. The near term emphasis of the evolution 
planning is on methods of increasing the efficiency and productivity 
of the Space Station and on requirements to support new initiatives

the transportation system now envisioned by NASA, which includes 
a space station for Earth orbital logistics and orbital transfer 
vehicles for Earth-Moon transportation. A scientific laboratory on

exploration; long-duration experiments defining the lunar 
environment and its modification by surface activity; new classes

A conceptual design study of an aeroassisted orbital transfer 
vehicle is discussed. Nicknamed TAXI, it will ferry personnel and 
cargo: (1) between low Earth orbit and a spacecraft circling around 
the Sun in permanent orbit intersecting gravitational fields of Earth 
and Mars, and (2) between the cycling spacecraft and a Mars 
orbiting station, co-orbiting with Phobos. Crew safety and mission 
flexibility (in terms of ability to provide a wide range of delta-V) 
were given high priority. Three versions were considered, using 
the same overall configuration based on a low L/D aerobrake 
with the geometry of a raked off elliptical cone with ellipsoidal 
nose and a toroidal skirt. The propulsion system consists of three 
gimballed L0X/LH2 engines firing away from the aerobrake. The 
versions differ mainly in the size of the aeroshields and propellant 
tanks. TAXI A version resulted from an initial effort to design a 
single transfer vehicle able to meet all delta-V requirements during 
the 15-year period (2025 to 2040) of Mars mission operations. 
TAXI B is designed to function with the cycling spacecraft moving 
in a simplified, nominal trajectory. On Mars missions, TAXI B would 
be able to meet the requirements of all the missions with a relative 
approach velocity near Mars of less than 9.3 km/sec. Finally, 
TAXI O is a revision of TAXI A, a transfer vehicle designed for 
missions with a relative velocity near Mars larger than 9.3 km/sec. 
All versions carry a crew of 9 (1 1 with modifications) and a cargo 
of 10000 Ibm. Trip duration varies from 1 day for transfer from 
LEO to the cycling ship to nearly 5 days for transfer from the 
ship to the Phobos orbit. Author

The purpose of this study was to determine the critical issues 
for a potential lunar outpost by polling a group of experts 
knowledgeable about decision-making involving the allocation of 
large-scale resources. A Delphi exercise is an iterative polling 
technique in which the group opinion is refined during successive 
iterations, while at the same time preserving differing viewpoints. 
The experts identified four critical issues: (1) demonstration of the 
value of a lunar base (e.g., cost effective lunar-based science, 
source of raw materials, technology spin-offs, etc.); (2) sustained 
political and financial support; (3) credibility of the government 
(i.e., NASA) in accomplishing such a large and complex program; 
(4) development of the military value of a lunar base. GRA

Reductions in expected STS flight rates of the Space Shuttle 
since the 51 -L accident raise concerns about the ability of available 
launch capacity to meet both payload-to-orbit and crew rotation 
requirements for the Space Station. In addition, it is believed that 
some phases of Station build-up could be expedited using 
unmanned launch systems with significantly greater lift capacity 
than the STS. Examined is the potential use of expendable launch 
vehicles (ELVs), yet-to-be-developed unmanned shuttle-derived 
vehicles (SDVs), and international launch vehicles for meeting 
overall launch requirements to meet Space Station program 
objectives as defined by the 1986 Critical Evaluation Task Force 
(CETF). The study concludes that use of non-STS transportation 
can help meet several important program objectives as well as 
reduce the total number of STS flights. It also finds, however, 
that reduction of Space Station-dedicated STS flights below 8 per 
year forces a reduction in Station crew size assuming the CETF 
90 day crew stay time baseline and seriously impairs scientific 
utilization of the Station. Author

Due to large amounts of oxygen required for space travel, a 
method of mining, transporting, and storing this oxygen in space 
would facilitate further space exploration. The following project 
deals specifically with the methods for transporting liquid oxygen 
from the lunar surface to the Lunar Orbit (LO) space station, and 
then to the Lower Earth Orbit (LEO) space station. Two vehicles 
were designed for operation between the LEO and LO space 
stations. The first of these vehicles is an aerobraked design vehicle. 
The Aerobrake Orbital Transfer Vehicle (OTV) is capable of 
transporting 5000 Ibm of payload to LO while returning to LEO 
with 60,000 Ibm of liquid oxygen, and thus meet mission 
requirements. The second vehicle can deliver 18,000 Ibm of payload 
to LO and is capable of bringing 60,000 Ibm of liquid oxygen 
back to LEO. A lunar landing vehicle was also designed for 
operation between LO and the established moon base. The use 
of an electromagnetic railgun as a method for launching the lunar 
lander was also investigated. The feasibility of the railgun is doubtful 
at this time. A system of spheres was also designed for proper 
storing and transporting of the liquid oxygen. The system assumes 
a safe means for transferring the liquid oxygen from tank to tank 
is operational. A sophisticated life support system was developed 
for both the OTV and the lunar lander. This system focuses on 
such factors as the vehicle environment, waste management, water 
requirements, food requirements, and oxygen requirements.

list as inputs and a time line of scheduled activities, updated 
resource availability profiles, evaluations of the computed 
schedules, and a listing of activities by success level as outputs. 
The operations of the system are: activity selection, activity 
placement, resource profile updates, and contingency handling. 
The user interactions and interface of the system are examined. 
The effects of strategy selection on the schedule output are 
investigated, and methods for handling power efficiency under 
different scheduling scenarios are proposed. I.F.

be launched in 1995. The ATP has two major objectives. One is 
to establish the advanced technologies essential to the future 
space platforms. The other is to conduct autonomous and in-orbit 
serviceable space experiments. To meet the various mission 
demands and to attain the high performance, the ATP adopts 
modular design, in-orbit servicing capability and advanced 
subsystem technologies. As subsystem technologies for the ATP, 
rendezvous-docking, two phase fluid loop thermal control and 
retractable flexible solar array are under development. The mission 
profile of the ATP is divided into two phases. Many space 
experiments such as material processing are conducted after the 
technology demonstration mission. Author

of its point of attachment Controllability of the linearized equations 
is established numerically and a comparative study of three different 
control strategies conducted. The strategies employ thrusters, 
tension in the tether line or motion of the offset of the attachment 
to achieve control of the system subjected to a relatively large 
initial disturbance. Results suggest that, in the stationkeeping mode, 
the tension control strategy damps a given disturbance in the 
shortest time, but at an expense of the energy. On the other 
hand, the offset control proves to be the most efficient in terms 
of energy consumption, but now the response to disturbance 
persists over a long duration. In addition, the performance of the 
thruster control and tension control strategies are analyzed during 
retrieval of the tether from different initial lengths. Author

Research on the structure of molecules by X-ray diffraction 
analysis requires large single crystals. However, the dynamic 
behavior of proteins caused by their high molecular weight prevents 
the growth of large single crystals if this process is disturbed by 
thermal convection. For example, protein single crystals grown 
under terrestrial (1 g) conditions are limited to dimensions in the 
order of 0.1 mm, whereas the size of crystals, grown under (quasi) 
space conditions has been 5 times larger (pilot experiment Cryostat, 
Spacelab). Under Eureca conditions (e.g., no micron gravity 
disturbances), the result in regularity of crystal growth and size is 
expected to be much better. An overview is given of the Protein 
Crystallization Facility which includes experiment-, service- and 
secondary cooling module and its interfaces to the Eureca carrier. 
A short mission profile concerning cooling-, power-, and data 
exchange requiiaments is presented. Author

FAULT TOLERANT ONBOARD IMPLEMENTATION OF 

CONTROL PROCEDURES IN TETHERED SATELLITE

S.p.A., Milan, Italy) IN: Automatic control in space 1985. Oxford

The Space Shuttle's Tethered Satellite requires general 
spacecraft management, autonomous data handling, and safety 
precautions for both the Shuttle and the satellite. Fault tolerance 
is implemented via a process of task-migration between two 
processors in the event of a failure in either. The two 
microprocessors have independent software packages, one for 
general spacecraft management and the other for attitude control. 
A backup software package is used when one of the two 
microprocessors is out of service. O.C.

ON CONTROL OF TETHERED SATELLITE SYSTEMS

Automatic control in space 1985. Oxford and New York, Pergamon 
Press, 1986, p. 145-151. refs 

The dynamics of tethered satellite systems is rather complex 
and consists of various rotational and vibrational degrees of 
freedom. While designing its control system, some of these degrees 
of freedom may be modeled while the others are likely to be left 
unmodeled to reduce complexity and cost. This paper examines 
the effectiveness of control procedures based on lower order 
dynamical models, when applied to higher order models. It appears 
that if a tension control law or its derivative is to be used to 
control the tether dynamics, a reasonably higher order model 
including the transverse vibrations must be considered to 
synthesize the control system. Author

The purpose of the present paper is to indicate the main aspects 
in terms of aerothermodynamic performance and technological 
solutions in designing a tethered atmospheric probe satellite as a 
facility for experimental gas dynamics. On the basis of the available 
atmosphere models and the theory of flying bodies in rarefied 
gases, the flow regimes experienceable by the tethered satellite 
module in its nominal mission and the behavior of a conventional 
thermal control design have been analyzed. For computing 
aerodynamic heating rates at lower altitudes, a probabilistic 
transitional flow model has been adopted. Design solutions 
employing nonconventional thermal protection techniques and high 
temperature insulating materials have been investigated. Author

Low density gas flow modeling and current ground wind-tunnel 
technologies are not presently able to produce fully reliable data 
concerning low density flow regimes. In order to answer some of 
these issues, the Shuttle Continuous Open Wind Tunnel (SCOWT) 
program has been proposed, which makes use of the tethered 
satellite system (TSS). SCOWT's objective is to investigate the 
energy and momentum transfer between the tethered satellite and 
its environmental medium within the range of the 
thermofluid-dynamic conditions experienced by TSS during its 
atmospheric flights. The feasibility and capability of SCOWT to 
perform low density aerothermodynamics studies are investigated. 
Some of the results^ obtained by means of a tether simulation 
program, and the instrumentation and TSS design main 
requirements to meet SCOWT objectives are described. Author

This research was performed in order to design a stabilizer fin 
for the tethered satellite. The U.S. Standard Atmosphere 76 was 
used for determining the atmospheric characteristics. The flow 
regime was determined by the Knudsen number, on the basis of 
the mean free path computed both from the Standard Atmosphere 
and from the theory of gases in local thermodynamic equilibrium. 
In order to compute heat fluxes, the Stanton number was used, 
calculated both by the Reeves and the Von Camp theory and by 
the Monti theory. Author

Begining as early as 1994, the NASA Space Station will be 
operational in low equatorial orbit. It is presently recommended 
that the Station incorporate as part of its instrument suite a 
multispectral synthetic aperture imaging radar, which would be 
primarily used to map cloud-covered regions of the globe, and an 
Imaging spectrometer, which would be similar to the Shuttle 
Multispectral IR Radiometer. The radar would give emphasis to 
the study of such transient phenomena as ocean surface roughness 
and wind shear effects during hurricanes and typhoons; the 
radiometer would have a 50-km swath width, and 1 28 bands from 
0.4 to 2.5 microns. O.C.

This paper reports the results of three tethered rocket 
experiments conducted as part of a U.S.-Japan joint program under 
way since 1 980. The major purpose of the experiments is to obtain 
technical and scientific data supporting the figure electrodynamic 
tethered subsatellite experiments by the Space Shuttle. Vehicle 
charging due to dc beam emission up to 80 mA in the 150-200 
km altitude range was repeatedly measured by both Langmuir 
and floating probes, and was found to be usually less than 10 V. 
During the 80 mA emission, clear evidence for the ignition of a 
beam-plasma discharge was obtained. In a tether deployment 
experiment, it was found that the tether wire acted as an antenna 
whose impedance decreased with the extension of the wire both 
in high-frequency and very low-frequency bands. Substantial rocket 
charging was observed during periods of electron-beam very 
low-frequency pulsing. CD.

signals is described. Response-time distortion is reduced 
independently of any model of mass spectrometer behavior. The 
delay of the system is found first from the cross-correlation function 
of a step change and its response. A two-sided time-domain digital 
correction filter (deconvolution filter) is generated next from the 
same step response data using a regression procedure. Other 
data are corrected using the filter and delay. The mean squared 
error between a step response and a step is reduced considerably 
more after the use of a deconvolution filter than after the application 
of a second-order model correction. 02 consumption and C02 
production values calculated from data corrupted by a simulated 
dynamic process return to near the uncorrupted values after 
correction. Although a clean step response or the ensemble 
average of several responses contaminated with noise is needed 
for the generation of the filter, random noise of magnitude not 
above 0.5 percent added to the response to be corrected does 
not impair the correction severely. Author

A mathematical model for studying the dynamics of the Tethered 
Satellite System (TSS) is proposed that accounts for a 
three-dimensional offset of the point of attachment. The system 
chosen consists of a plate-type Space Station from which a tether 
supported subsatellite is deployed or retrieved. The mass of the 
tether as well as the rigid body dynamics of the tether, subsatellite 
and Space Station are considered. Controllability of the linearized 
equations is established numerically and the control is achieved 
through simple velocity feedback using thrusters and momentum 
wheels. Author

This paper describes the current development of a noncryogenic 
gravity gradiometer for future use on board the tethered satellite 
system (TSS). The paper also proposes a way of testing a 
single-axis prototype of such an instrument that makes use of the 
free-fall technique in vacuum. This gravity gradiometer has a design 
sensitivity of the order of 0.01 EU in 10-s integration time. Because 
of the small size and light weight, a noncryogenic gravity 
gradiometer is a valid candidate to fit the limited accommodation 
capability of the TSS deployed from the Shuttle and maintained, 



for several days, at an altitude of 120-130 km. This unique capability 
improves the resolution and accuracy achievable in reconstructing 
the earth gravity field, in particular at short wavelengths. A 
preliminary analysis of the dynamics of the TSS satellite indicates 
the potential of such satellite as a low-attitude research platform 
for gravity gradiometry. Author

The problem of designing a computerized experiment monitoring

concept of focus of attention and by exploiting parallelism. The 
use of the Contract Net Protocol for the latter purpose is discussed. 
The use of ideas from information science to help focus a 
programs's efforts on those computations likely to bring results is 
addressed, and the incorporation of those ideas into a design in 
order to aid the system in deciding upon the best course of action 
is considered. CD.

A vapor transport furnace capable of operating on several 
different experiment carriers on the Space Transportation System 
(STS) or on Space Station is described. The furnace consists of 
two concentric aluminum tubes with a vacuum space between 
them. A quartz ampoule containing the chemicals for crystal growth 
is placed inside of the inner aluminum tube. Special design 
considerations allow the furnace to operate at a 413 K interior 
temperature with a power consumption of less than three watts 
when operated in a 293 K environment. Gold coatings decrease 
the radiation heat transfer. A special support mechanism between 
the two aluminum tubes causes the heat transfer by conduction 
to be inconsequential. Results of thermal analyses are described 
herein. The design is versatile enough to allow its use in solution 
crystal growth, polymer reactions, and other applications in addition 
to vapor transport crystal growth. Author

The Astrometric Telescope Facility (AFT) will be an orbiting 
observatory which has been proposed to be attached to the NASA 
Space Station. The primary scientific objectives of the ATF will be 
to search for extrasolar planetary systems and to study their 
characteristics. In addition, the ATF will be able to perform other 
general astrometric observations of stars within the Milky Way 
Galaxy. Astrometric Telescope Facility operations from the Space 
Station will be simple and straightfonward compared to other orbiting 
free-flying telescopes. The astrometric approach to planetary 
detection, which uses repeated measurements of the same set of 
target stars over many years, is compatible with simple, repetitive 
operations of the facility. The support provided by the Space Station 
and anomaly tolerance features of the ATF design also contribute 
to the simplicity of the operations concept. Author

Various aspects of the use of tethers on the Space Station 
and other platforms are examined. Consideration is given to the 
use of tethers to improve gravity gradient stabilization, provide 
desired microgravity levels with a tethered elevator, improve 
docking maneuvers, and allow construction and deployment of 
solar sails. Special attention is given to the use of electrodynamic 
tethers for the generation of electrical power for the Space Station. 
In addition, uses for expendable tethers, tethered waste disposal, 
the return of Station material, and vehicle deploymemt/reentry 
with tethers are discussed together with a sling tether maneuver 
for orbit transfer. Possible implemetation scenarios are described, 
and issues which must be addressed in the tether/platform 
integration are identified. Although tethered systems can 
significantly increase overall Space Station capability, they are 
complex and do require careful up-front design to ensure their 
overall safety and practicality. The paper includes multiple diagrams 
illustrating uses of tether systems. I.S.

The paper summarizes the "early experiment aspects' of the 
session which focused on the need for low cost, simple flight 
experiments to verify tether concepts, analysis methods and 
simulations and to build a data base for future application of tethers. 
The papers discussed six well thoughtout new space experiments, 
a modest start toward obtaining the data needed before tether 
concepts can be realistically expected to be adopted in real 
designs. Of the ninety-five papers included in the Venice 
conference, only six new small experiments were discussed. 
In-space verification of the data base needed to design operational 
tethers continues to be a step in the future. Author

This paper describes the concept of a large gamma-ray imaging 
telescope system (GRITS) which will provide sufficient sensitivity 
for the identification of faint objects to be catalogued by the 
Gamma-Ray Observatory. The technique used in this telescope 
for the detection of gamma rays is based on the conversion of 
the incident gamma ray into an electron-positron pair which 
subsequently produces Cherenkov radiation. The gamma ray is 
identified by a unique signature based on a sequence of 
time-delayed coincidence events. The GRITS telescope will use 
the extended Shuttle external tank, ET, as the pressure vessel 
necessary for the gas-Cherenkov process. Astronauts from the 
Shuttle or the Space Station performing EVA will convert ET to 
an autonomous spacecraft and install the telescope inside the 
ET. I.S.

TETHER SATELLITE POTENTIAL FOR RAREFIED GAS 

AERODYNAMIC RESEARCH

Applications of the tether satellite in aerodynamic research 
under conditions of low density hypervelocity flow are described. 
The satellite is envisioned as a sphere nose, slab-sided cylinder 
with variably swept wing, tethered to the Shuttle Orbiter and 
deployed to altitudes of about 95 km and above. Suggested 
experiments reflect requirements for new understanding of low 
density flows and include the direct measurement of normal and 
tangential stress on representative aerospace surfaces, the 
measurements of vehicle lift, drag and pitching moment, ambient 
gas density and composition, surface temperatures, and wall tap 
and impact probe behavior. Also suggested are measurements of 
gas densities above the wing surfaces and on or near the stagnation 
line using electron beam fluorescence methods and, where 
applicable, free molecule orifice probes. Experiments proposed 
are consistent with the objectives of the STARFAC proposal and 
may be implemented without significant development of new 
technology. Author

The data on aerothermodynamic and aerodynamic interactions 
at altitudes above 50 km is extremely limited because of the relative 
inaccessibility of the region to research vehicles of any sort. This

An evaluation is made of the applicability of tethered satellites 
to geomagnetic field and low altitude magnetospheric/ionospheric 
plasma investigations. Geomagnetic field observations from 
tethered satellites with gradiometers promise higher field 
measurement accuracy and the separation of current effects; 
plasma observations are important in understanding such 
processes as the deposition of magnetospheric energy into the 
upper atmosphere, and the influence of magnetospheric current 
distribution on this process. The unusual requirements that emerge 
for attitude knowledge and dynamic isolation in the satellite's 
instrumentation are discussed. O.C.

THE STRUCTURE OF ULF WAVES PRODUCED BY A 

TETHERED SATELLITE SYSTEM

and Astrophysics (ISSN 0004-6361), vol. 186, no. 1-2, Nov. 1987, 
p. 354-358. refs 

The Atfven waves produced by a tethered satellite system (TSS) 
are modeled within the MHD approximation. Expressions for the 
current, velocity, electric, and magnetic fields are derived using 
the general formalism given by Wright and Southwood (1987) to 
describe stationary Alfvenic structures. The current closure in the 
Alfven wave is found to have some novel features. The subsidiary 
current system that flows in a plane perpendicular to the wave 
structure has a quadrupolar character, in contrast to the dipolar 
magnetic field and flow perturbations. The topology of the 
perpendicular current has not been understood in previous TSS 
models. The worked example that is presented compliments the 
work of Wright and Southwood, who anticipated that the polar 
order of the perpendicular currents would be twice that of the 
magnetic field and plasma flow perturbations. Author

THE INCREDIBLY VERSATILE SPACE TETHER 

BOB JAQUES Space Markets (ISSN 0258-4212), Winter 1987, 
p. 208-210. 

A simple space tether connects two orbiting masses by a space 
environment-resistant wire; these masses are forced to orbit at 
the angular velocity of the system's center-of-gravity. Since the 
speed of the upper mass is greater than it would normally be if 
the mass were untethered and orbiting at the same altitude, a 
greater centrifugal force than gravitational force is experienced by 
it. The reverse is true for the lower mass, which experiences a 
greater gravitational than centrifugal force. Attention is presently 
given to the electrodynamic, transportation, and pure/applied 
scientific experimentation applications of the space tether 
concept. O.C.

ALFVEN WAVES FROM AN ELECTRODYNAMIC TETHERED

(Contract NAG8-551) 

The ionospheric plasma currents associated with the operation 
of an orbiting, constant current electrodynamic tethered satellite 
system are calculated using linear cold plasma theory and a 
tethered system current distribution model that takes into account 
the peculiar dumbbell shape of the system. The field line current 
calculations show plasma sheet currents at each end of the 
tethered system whose structure is roughly that of the Alfven 
wings. The disturbance caused by the moving tethered system 
extends behind its dimensions along the line of sight. The form of 
the wings alters as they travel away from the system. The front 
boundary becomes sharper while the ripples in J(z) in the wake 
extend to greater distances with larger amplitude. The wave 
impedance is calculated for a wide range of system dimension 
values. The expression is in sharp disagreement with a recently 
published result by Dobrowolny and Veltri (1986). CD.

On the basis of their long lasting cooperation in space activities, 
Aerospatiale and MBB have signed in 1983 a cooperative 
agreement in the field of geostationary communication satellites. 
They have developed a family of platforms, named Spacebus, 
with the goal to rationalize their development effort and to offer 
to any customer an optimized product. Allocation of system and 



subsystem responsibilities has been made, depending on various 
criteria, and development efforts focussed, for each company, in 
dedicated fields. The paper presents the performance of the various 
members of the Spacebus family (Spacebus 100, Spacebus 300), 
describes the highlights of platform subsystems, and presents 
several examples of applications (Direct Broadcasting Satellites 
and Telecommunication Satellites such as TV-Sat, TDF, Tele-X, 
Eutelsat II). It ends with indication of future developments aiming 
at improvement of the performance of the existing products and 
extending the range of applications to future, more demanding 
missions. Author

Satellite radar altimeters have demonstrated a wide range of 
scientific capabilities over oceans and ice, and have considerable 
potential over land and inland water. However, the universal 
adoption of the single-beam, pulse-limited mode of operation limits 
the spatial and temporal sampling achievable and makes the 
generation of surface elevation maps critically dependent on the 
accuracy of the satellite orbit reconstruction. Also, over topographic 
surfaces, the data can be difficult, sometimes impossible, to 
interpret. With the advent of the Columbus polar platform, previous 
limitations on the size and complexity of space instruments will 
not apply. What types of swath altimeter might take advantage of 
this possibility are considered, and it is concluded that both 
multifeed, large antenna instruments and an interferometric design 
could provide valuable advances. Ultimately, a scanning beam, 
phased array instrument could provide full global coverage with 
high spatial resolution. Author

The geostationary tether satellite system expands the 
geostationary orbit resource from a one-dimensional arc into a 
two-dimensional disk. The tethered satellites, each several 
thousand kilometers apart and aligned along the local vertical, 
are stabilized at the altitude of the geosynchronous orbital speed. 
When this system is applied to communications systems, it is 
estimated that the number of satellites can be increased as much 
as 13 times and the communication capacity can be increased 
more than 17 times, compared with a conventional geostationary 
satellite orbit system. Author

Avail: NTIS HC All /MF A01 

The construction of a large multimirror interferometer in space 
is proposed. Resolution of 0.001 arcsec at 100 nm is feasible 
with a 20 m baseline. A shuttle launched 14 m linear array, a 2 
dimensional, deployable 20 m array, and arrays of 6 to 20 free-flying 
telescopes with baselines up to 40 km and resolution of 0.000001 
arcsec at 200 nm are possible. At short UV wavelengths a 
multimirror interferometer will produce speckle interferograms 
caused by misalignment of the interferometer. From the speckle 
interferograms true images can be reconstructed by the 
phase-closure method (if the exit pupil is a nonredundant array) 
or by speckle masking (for general pupils). In the case of bright 
objects the phase-closure method yields higher signal-to-noise ratio 
than speckle masking. In the case of faint objects speckle masking 



yields higher signal-to-noise ratio than the phase-closure method. 
The limiting magnitude of optical long-baseline interferometry in 
space is 24 or fainter. ESA

Because of the immense size of the solar-terrestrial system 
and its tightly-coupled physical nature, its study requires a carefully 
planned and coordinated approach using a variety of observational 
techniques. Of fundamental importance is the simultaneous 
measurement of the varying Sun, the solar wind, and the Earth's 
magnetosphere and atmosphere. These multiple measurements 
require a multi-spacecraft approach with both remote sensing of 
the Sun and atmosphere and in-situ measurements of the solar 
wind and magnetosphere. The decade of the 1990s will bring an 
opportunity to carry out the simultaneous set of measurements 
using a combination of instruments on missions such as the 
International Solar Terrestrial Physics Program, the GOES satellites, 
and the Space Station, For the first time it will be possible to 
determine solar variability and to sample the response of the solar 
wind and geospace portion of the environment in a thorough way. 
The potential opportunities for solar-terrestrial studies during the 
coming era of the Space Station are disclosed. Author

resistance to breakage and abrasion and electrical properties. In 
addition, laboratory development models of the electronics will be

Simulation of two short distance crawling maneuvers of the 
elevator both with and without environmental perturbations acting 
upon the system is discussed. These simulation runs were 
performed in order to provide results useful for the interpretation 
of the data from the tests, on the ground, of a scaled down 
engineering model of the elevator. In these simulation runs the 
elevator crawls along the tether in accordance to the developed 
mirror image motion control law (MIMCL). Results from the 
simulation of the 4 km long maneuver run were compared to 
those obtained by adopting the modified hyperbolic tangent control 
law (MHTCL). A preprocessor was developed for setting up the 
initial conditions of a tethered system with L platforms, M 
longitudinal dampers, and N lumped masses (platforms plus tether 
beads). A short test run of the 4-platform system with 3 longitudinal 
dampers and 10 lumper mass without any perturbation acting upon 
the system is illustrated. In support of the Tether Applications 
Working Group, SAO is preparing a catalog of tether simulations, 
has prepared a set of simulator test cases, obtained results from 
SKYHOOK, and solicited results from simulators at other 
institutions, and prepared a paper on a specific analytic solution.

The Carbon Dioxide Observational Platform System (CO-OPS) 
is a near-space, geostationary, multi-user, unmanned microwave 
powered monitoring platform system. This systems engineering 
feasibility study addressed identified existing requirements such 
as: carbon dioxide observational data requirements, 
communications requirements, and eye-in-the-sky requirements of 
other groups like the Defense Department, the Forestry Service, 
and the Coast Guard. In addition, potential applications in: earth 
system science, space system sciences, and test and verification 
(satellite sensors and data management techniques) were 
considered. The eleven month effort is summarized. Past work 
and methods of gathering the required observational data were 
assessed and rough-order-of magnitude cost estimates have shown 
the CO-OPS system to be most cost effective (less than $30 
million within a 10 year lifetime). It was also concluded that there 
are no technical, schedule, or obstacles that would prevent 
achieving the objectives of the total 5-year CO-OPS program.

The purpose of this project was to examine the utility of 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran coatings for control of 
electroosmosis and protein adsorption; electroosmosis is an 
important, deleterious process affecting electrophoretic 
separations, and protein adsorption is a factor which needs to be 
controlled during protein crystal growth to avoid multiple nucleation 
sites. Performance of the project required use of X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy to refine previously developed 
synthetic methods. The results of this spectroscopic examination 
are reported. Measurements of electroosmotic mobility of charged 
particles in appropriately coated capillaries reveals that a new. 
one-step route to coating capillaries gives a surface in which 
electroosmosis is dramatically reduced. Similarly, both PEG and 
dextran coatings were shown by protein adsorption measurements 
to be highly effective at reducing protein adsorption on solid 
surfaces. These results should have impact on future low-g 
electrophoretic and protein crystal growth experiments. Author

One of the needs of the experimenters on the space station is 
access to steady and controlled-variation microgravity 
environments. A method of providing these environments is to 
place the experiment on a tether attached to the space station. 
This provides a high degree of isolation from structural oscillations 
and vibrations. Crawlers can move these experiments along the 
tethers to preferred locations, much (ike an elevator. This report 
describes the motion control laws developed for these crawlers 
and the testing of laboratory models of these tether elevator 
crawlers. Author

It is proposed to fly high resolution auroral imaging instruments 
and particle spectrometers on the Columbus Polar Platform (PPF). 
A set of UV and X-ray imagers with wide field of view (horizon to 
horizon) will map the large scale (semiglobal) features of the aurora 
at day and night with fairly high spatial and temporal resolution. A 
set of visible and X-ray imagers and imaging spectrographs in 
visible and UV range with narrow field (NF) of view will give images 
with very high spatial resolution (better than 1 km and a few km 
respectively for optical and X-ray imagers) and a time resolution 
of 1 sec. The NF-imagers will be mounted on a pointable instrument 
pedestal to be operated in different modes. Particle spectrometers 
will cover electrons and ions over a wide energy range, and with 
high time resolution (10 ms). it is also desireable to fly a 
magnetometer. The particle and field instruments should be 
integrated in a separate package mounted on a boom protruding 
at least 10 m from the PPF, to minimize the contamination from 
the PPF environment. ESA

The tethered satellite concept is introduced, and the advantages 
of being able to fly sensors closer to the Earth's surface than is 
normally possible with spacecraft (e.g., 200 to 100 km altitude) 
are underlined. Tethers can also be used to fly several sensors 
with well defined separation. Problems arise in dynamics and 
control, and the tether can be damaged by heating or space 
debris. Columbus platforms could carry tethers. Earth observation 
missions, including high resolution remote sensing, gravity 
gradiometry, geomagnetic surveys, and atmospheric sounding are 
suggested. ESA

Conflicts between Earth observation and space science and 
microgravity payloads on the Space Station are discussed. Earth 
observation and space science instruments, in order to be 
compatible with microgravity payloads, have to operate in such a 
way as to minimize disturbances transmitted to the carrier by 
pointing, scanning, and similar maneuvers. Microgravity payloads 
such as material science furnaces are likely (due to venting of 
volatile materials and gases) to produce considerable pollution of 
the external space environment near the spacecraft. This is likely 
to be a problem for optical instruments used for Earth observation 
or astronomy especially if cooled optical surfaces are involved 
where these materials could condense on and obscure the optics. 
Other conflicts involve competition for data channels, thermal 
compatibility, and competition for power. ESA

Accommodation for ESA payloads on the main truss structure 
of the space station was studied. It is concluded that the truss 
structure is suitable for the accommodation of attached payloads. 
European opportunity is very sensitive to American decisions and 
other user nation competition. Payload grouping on dedicated ESA 
carriers is the best way for an optimum usage of attachment 
points. The most promising attachment location on the truss 
structure is on the upper beam. The mission baseline schedule is 
too long due to European constraints. Items of flight and in-orbit 
resources demand the biggest funding effort (44 percent and 28 
percent respectively). Man tended free flyers are suitable for small 
payloads. ESA

Antenna control for the Far Infrared and Submiilimeter Space 
Telescope 8 m, foldable dish was investigated. The best fit contour 
of the reflector must not deviate from the ideal paraboloid by 
greater than 8 microns rms throughout the operational temperature 
range between minus 107 and minus 185 C. The structural design 
leads to CFRP sandwich shell elements on self supporting CFRP 
frameworks. Aluminum and Kevlar cores were studied as to their 
effects on thermally induced contour errors, and an error budget 
was established. Mechanisms for fixing the stowed and unfolded 
configuration and for panel deployment were defined. Methods 
for in-orbit calibration were identified and an on-ground adjustment 
concept for antenna assembly was defined. A panel with CFRP 
cover sheets and an Al core was exposed to a thermal cycling 
test, proving manufacturing accuracy and insensitivity to thermal 
loads. The suitability of the surface coating is demonstrated by 
microwave reflectivity measurements. Breadboard models of 
adjustment mechanisms for in-orbit correction of the main dish 
contour were successfully tested. ESA

Progress was made on the analysis of tether damping and on 
experimentation of the control system on the laboratory simulator. 
The damping analysis considers the dynamics of a long tether 
connecting two spacecraft in Earth orbit, one of the spacecraft 
having dominant mass. In particular, it considers the material 
damping of the tether. The results show that, with properly chosen 
tether material and braiding structure, longitudinal vibration of the 
tethered system is well damped. A particularly effective method 
of implementing attitude control for tethered satellites is to use 
the tether tension force to generate control torques by moving 
the tether attach point relative to the satellite center of mass. A 
scaled, one dimensional laboratory simulation of the KITE mission 
was built and preliminary experiments of the proposed attitude 
control system were performed. The simulator was built to verify 
theoretical predictions of attitude controllability, and to investigate 
the technological requirements in order to implement this concept. 
A detailed description of the laboratory apparatus is provided, and 
in addition, the results of the preliminary experiments are presented 
and discussed. Author

Shuttle flights can revisit the Platform to perform servicing or 
payload exchange. This capability to support several payloads in

The paper examines the lessons learned from past experiences, 
the requirements that apply to the various types of missions 
requiring servicing, and the present plans for establishing a system 
by which on-orbit servicing, assembly, and repair will become 
routine. It is noted that, by expanding on the servicing experience 
and capabilities provided directly by the STS, the Space Station 
will significantly enhance the mission objectives of long-duration 
scientific missions, not only by repair and consumable 
replenishment, but also by the addition and replacement of scientific 
instruments with upgraded versions. The servicing facility design 
is described, and a typical servicing scenario is presented. B.J.

On-orbit satellite servicing has been demonstrated on a variety 
of missions using the Space Shuttle. This capability is also a 
stated goal of the Space Station and other unmanned vehicles. 
Serviceable spacecraft should be able to take advantage of all 
these servicing facilities. This paper will discuss one effort to 
document currently available or nearly operational servicing 
interfaces. Availability of this type of compiled information will assist 
in a smooth transition from Shuttle-based satellite servicing to 
servicing at a wider range of locations and by different servicing 
vehicles. Author

The Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle (OMV) will provide a means 
of bringing large observatories to the Space Station for servicing 
and redeployment to their operating altitudes. However, there are 
many constraints which must be met in mission planning. The 
missions must be designed so that propellant consumption is within 
the usable allowance, but contingency operations can still be 
accomplished. The vehicle was designed specifically to 
accommodate such missions, with emphasis upon servicing the 
Hubble Space Telescope. The OMV has been designed for 
operations from the Shuttle Orbiter and the Space Station. It will 
readily accommodate basing at the Space Station and executing 
observatory retrieval and redeployment missions. Mission profiles 
have been designed which allow retrieval with contingency hold 
before descent, and which allow contingency return of the

observatory if it fails to reactivate properly. This capability will be 
a major addition to the Space Transportation System and will 
increase the utility of the Space Station. Author

This paper describes the work completed on the Orbital 
Spacecraft Consumables Resupply System (OSCRS) for the 
Johnson Space Center. The study objective was to provide a 
concept to NASA for supplying earth storable liquids and gases 
to a variety of orbiting vehicles, including Space Station, OMV 
and other satellites in orbits compatible with Shuttle resupply. The 
design is based on a cylindrical propellant tank optimized for 
transporting liquids in the Orbiter bay. The tank is polar mounted 
with the attachment fittings configured as Orbiter sill trunnions. 
The pressurant tanks provide support between the sill and keel 
fittings. Two potential spacecraft interface mechanisms were 
investigated. Continuing OSCRS effort will be directed toward 
further standardization studies, adapting the design to the Space 
Station Servicing Bay and investigating the possibilities of using 
ELV launchers. Author

The servicing requirements for future GEO platforms are 
discussed, and technological issues associated with the servicing 
techniques and hardware are considered. The required 
technologies are identified through a study of two hypothetical 
future platforms: (1) a life science platform, representing a form 
of aggressive GEO utilization growth; and (2) a geostationary earth 
observation platform, representing a more modest form of GEO 
growth. A mix of manned and unmanned servicing is postulated 
to fulfill the requirements for consumable replenishment, 
experiment/instrument retrieval and replacement, and in-situ repair 
operations. R.R.

One of the principal goals of the participants in the International 
Space Station program is to provide a management support 
structure which is equitable and fair to all participants, responsive 
to the needs of users, responsible to other partners, and mutually 
supportive to the participation of other partners. Shared-utilization, 
shared-cost, and shared-operations policies considerations are 
discussed. Special attention is given to the methodology for 
identifying costs and benefits of this program, in which each partner 
should be provided with benefits in proportion to his contribution, 
and no partner would be forced to share in cost the inefficiencies 
introduced by other partners. The Space Station hierarchy of 
operations functions are identified, and the recommended 
framework planning and control hierarchy is presented. I.S.

The logistics aspects of the Columbus Man Tended Free Flyer

studies. It is shown that the architecture of the in-orbit elements 
and the selection, design, and use of transportation to carry the 
logistics cargo have an important impact on the logistics of the 
MTFF. Of great importance are also cost factors. Another important 
consideration is the share of logistics cargo the recovery of which 
is of no or small interest. Depending on this percentage, a better 
optimization of the HERMES and LOVE designs and ways of their

The determination of the servicing requirements for the Polar 
Platform element of ESA's Columbus space station component, 
with respect both to the platform and its payloads, is highly 
dependent on the engineering reliability index that is used as the 
planned interval to replacement, as well as on management 
decisions at the level of operational system reliability. It is found 
that on-orbit servicing of a large polar platform is cost-effective 
relative to a series of smaller expendable spacecraft supporting 
the same operational payloads, even when the small spacecraft 
are given an optimistic service life of 5 years. O.C.

operational plan to take advantage of the target spacecraft's 
maneuvering ability by making it responsible for a portion of the 
maneuvers necessary to achieve rendezvous. This work resulted 
in the development of a region in space relative to the Shuttle, 
called the control box, into which the target vehicle maneuvers. 
Furthermore, a mission operations plan was developed to 
implement the control box technique. Author

The design and the operation principles of the Crewlock device 
(to be used in conjunction with the Spacehab module) for EVA 
operations are discussed. In Crewlock, the task of transiting from 
a volume at one pressure to another volume at a different pressure 
is approached in a manner different from that of airlocks. A 
Crewlock transit chamber is close form-fit to the transiting body; 
thus, the loss of and possible contaminants from pressurant gases 
become negligible; the need for pumps is eliminated; the mass, 
volume, and complexity of the lock is reduced; and the time required 
for transit is shorter. The Spacehab module will accomodate the 
Crewlock and provide storage space for the added suit components 
and expendables. By using Crewlock in a Spacehab module, the 
permissible working EVA's on a single Shuttle flight will be limited 
only by the Shuttle stay time and the crew endurance; if alternate 
crewmembers are available, the Space Station assembly manhours 
can be increased to over 100 hrs for a ten day orbit stay. I.S,

and repair of tubular systems on the Space Station are described. 
The program involves: (1) determining the feasibility of using 
metallurgical processes for tube joining; (2) determining the 
feasibility of installing and repairing currently available aerospace 
tube fittings in environments typical of those for the Space Shuttle; 
(3) evaluating the ability of EVA-suited subjects to assemble or 
disassemble candidate quick-disconnect couplings; and (4) leak 



testing of both installed and repaired tube fittings and assembled 
quick-disconnect couplings at pressures and thermal cycles 
expected for the Space Station. CD.

The use of orbital spacecraft consumables resupply system 
(OSCRS) at the Space Station is investigated, its use with the 
orbital maneuvering vehicle, and launch of the OSCRS on an 
expendable launch vehicles. A system requirements evaluation was 
performed initially to identify any unique requirements that would 
impact the design of OSCRS when used at the Space Station. 
Space Station documents were reviewed to establish requirements 
and to identify interfaces between the OSCRS, Shuttle, and Space 
Station, especially the Servicing Facility. The interfaces between 
OSCRS and the Shuttle consists of an avionics interface for 
command and control and a structural interface for launch support 
and for grappling with the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System. 
For use of the OSCRS at the Space Station, three configurations 
were evaluated using the results of the interface definition to 
increase the efficiency of OSCRS and to decrease the launch 
weight by Station-basing specific OSCRS subsystems. A modular 
OSCRS was developed in which the major subsystems were 
Station-based where possible. The configuration of an OSCRS 
was defined for transport of water to the Space Station. Author

from further consideration. An analysis of the phasing assembly 
showed that use of an Expendable Launch Vehicle in conjunction 
with the Space Transportation System (STS) can accelerate the 
buildup of the Station and ease the STS launch rate constraints. 
The study also showed that use of an Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle 
on the first flight can significantly benefit Station assembly and, 
by performing Station subsystem functions, can alleviate the need 
for operational control and reboost systems during the early flights. 
In addition to launch and assembly sequencing, the study assessed 
stability and control, and analyzed node-packaging options and 
the effects of keel removal on the structural dynamics of the 
Station. Results of these analyses are presented and discussed.

The current phase of the Space Station Operating System study 
is based on the analysis, evaluation, and comparison of the 
operating systems implemented on the computer systems and 
workstations in the software development laboratory. Primary 
emphasis has been placed on the DEC MicroVMS operating system 
as implemented on the MicroVax II computer, with comparative 
analysis of the SUN UNIX system on the SUN 3/260 workstation 
computer, and to a limited extent, the IBM PC/AT microcomputer 
running PC-DOS. Some benchmark development and testing was 
also done for the Motorola MC68010 (VM03 system) before the 
system was taken from the laboratory. These systems were studied 
with the objective of determining their capability to support Space 
Station software development requirements, specifically for 
multi-tasking and real-time applications. The methodology utilized 
consisted of development, execution, and analysis of benchmark 
programs and test software, and the experimentation and analysis 
of specific features of the system or compilers in the study.

Design features which enable ESA's Man-Tended Free Flyer 
(MTFF) to be operational on-orbit for a 30 yr period via servicing 
and maintenance are described. The MTFF is to be serviced at 
the Station or by Hermes every 6 months using man in the 
Pressurized Module (PM) and using robotics for the external 
equipment. Extravehicular activity is a contingency back-up to the 
latter. Crew servicing inside the PM is enhanced by design details 
allowing good access to the payload and subsystem equipment in 
the same manner as for the Attached Modules of the Station, 
that is by mounting all equipment in standard racks to which the 
crew have easy access. Servicing of the external items is achieved 
by mounting them in Orbital Replacement Units (ORU's) which 
are compatible with the Station and/or Hermes manipulator arms. 
The ORU's have standardized interface provisions for end effectors 
and also for attachment to their parent spacecraft. There are also 
nonstandard ORU's such as solar arrays and antennas. The MTFF 
has attitude/orbit control, stability, and position features, has RVD 
sensors and propulsive capabilities for orbit maintenance, transfer, 
and rendezvous functions. ESA

were successful, the repair mission shows higher financial returns 
without the added burden of remarketing or relaunching assets. 
Insurers learned that moderating losses arising from failures is 
not only possible, but can have significant impact on financial 
losses. To the extent that repair capability on-orbit can be enhanced 
and more certain, insurers can more readily consider this aspect 
in determining premium levels which should translate to lower 
insurance costs. Spacecraft designers should therefore bear in 
mind on-orbit servicing and repair from the outset. ESA

It is shown that cost effective utilization of space platforms is 
provided by the low cost operation of a relatively smalt co-orbiting 
platform suited to 1 000 kg payloads and 25 percent of the payload 
of a Space Shuttle (4200 kg) like EURECA. Frequent flight 
opportunities for external payload will be provided by on-orbit 
servicing. Servicing operations will start with low degree of 
serviceability and will be gradually increased with maturing servicing 
technologies. This will include remotely operated ORU exchange 
and complete payload element exchange or assembly. The GRASP 
orbital assembly mission planned by ESA will benefit from science 
carrier capabilities as well as from servicing techniques developed 
ior on-orbit deployment oi the large instrument. ESA

The consequences of double-shift operations during Spacelab 
missions where crew members are required to work at unusual 
times of their habitual 24 hr cycles are discussed. In addition to 
this shift-work condition, astronauts are exposed to a zeitgeber 
ensemble that is substantially altered in comparison with their 
normal routine on Earth. Most likely, these two factors cause 
permanent changes in the circadian regulatory system. Computer 
simulations and extrapolations from jet-lag studies demonstrate 
that the instable circadian state may cause serious problems for 
human physiology experiments. ESA

In 1986, the U.S. Department of Defense conducted a study 
to determine whether the hazard potential to spacecraft from space 
debris was sufficiently great to warrant efforts to reduce any further 
contributions to existing debris levels. The hazard has been found 
to be serious; technologies supporting the implementation of a 
policy restraining additional debris growth have been identified. 
Attention is presently given to the pressing need for the 
development of global policy guidelines for space debris

The angular distribution of 5 eV atomic oxygen scattered off a 
polished vitreous carbon surface was measured on a recent Space 
Shuttle flight. The experimental apparatus was of novel design, 
completely passive, and used thin silver films as the recording 
device for oxygen atoms. Most of the incident oxygen was 
contained in the reflected beam and remained in an active form 
and probably still atoms. Allowance was made for 12 percent 
loss of incident atoms which are converted to CO at the carbon 
surface. The scattered distribution which is wide lobular, peaking 
15 deg in the fonward direction, shows almost but not quite full 
accommodation. Author

The current status of debris in earth orbit, the measures which 
could be undertaken to prevent further debris, and the legal 
implications of the debris problem are reviewed. Topics addressed 
include the rapid increase in the number of spacecraft being 
tracked, the fact that much larger numbers of untracked objects 
of cm and sub-mm size are also in orbit, and the relative 
contributions of accidental explosions and ASAT tests to the debris. 
Particular attention is given to the debris hazard for large structures 
such as the Space Station and for astronauts performing EVAs, 
the reentry of large satellite fragments (including radioactive 
materials from reactors), and the difficulties satellites and debris 
pose for astronomers. It is argued that present international 
agreements and regulations are inadequate to control debris or 
hold the producers of nonaccidental debris liable for subsequent 
damages. T.K.

This paper examines the ability of the Space Station intermodule 
ventilation system to maintain centralized control of C02 removal 
and 02 supply. The resulting concentration gradients that will arise 
are calculated by assuming steady state, ideal gas, isothermal 
conditions, and perfect mixing of air within and between the 
pressurized elements. In order to estimate the degree of mixing 
actually obtained for a given ventilation scheme, a program has 
been developed based on a potential flow solution technique. 
Preliminary results from this study indicate that substantial short 
circuiting and recirculation air flow patterns could arise if a simple 
duct and diffuser air exchange method at the docking port interface 
were employed. Author

This paper presents the analysis of the nature, the source, 
and the effect of contamination encountered by payloads external 
to the Space Station spacecraft. The contaminant modeling study 
determined the key contaminant sources for the Space Station 
payloads, together with the location, the duration, the major 
constituents of the contaminant, and the possibility of contaminant 
control. The next phase of the contamination modeling study 
investigates the compatibility of external Space Station payloads 
while on the transverse boom and the dual keel option. Other 
predictions include depositions on payload surfaces facing along 
+X, +Y, and +Z directions. An additional analysis will utilize the 
above data to predict the spectral brightness of the contaminants 
along payload lines-of-sight, making it possible for payload users 
to determine the impact of the contaminant background relative 
to the natural background. I.S.

Ion measurements with charged particle detectors on negatively 
charged spacecraft have revealed anomalous fluxes of low energy 
ions, at energies below the charging peak. These 'spacecraft 
generated ions' have been noted on ATS-5, ATS-6, ISEE-1, and 
P78-2 (SCATHA). On SCATHA, the measurements generally take 
the form of a shadow peak, at an energy below the main peak in 
flux associated with the satellite potential. Such peaks follow the 
satellite potential, for constant detector look angle. When the 
detector look direction is varied, the energy of the peak varies; 
minimum energies are observed tangential to the satellite body. 
Occasionally, a broad spectrum of ion fluxes is observed below 
the charging peak, as on ATS-5. The principle source appears 
presently to be sputtering from the satellite surface, although 
outgassing molecules ionized by photons or ambient particles may 
play a significant role. Author

Calculations of the radiation dose equivalents to astronauts

a significant factor in the space radiation dose are extended. In 
particular, the components of the radiation dose are determined, 
and the relationship between dose and shielding thickness is 
determined. Shielding requirements are proposed for future 
spaceflights. A storm shelter protected by at least 9 cm of aluminum 
or its equivalent is recommended for all spaceflights outside the 
magnetosphere. On long-duration flights, such as a Mars mission, 
all habitable spaces should be shielded with 7.5 cm aluminum or

DEBRIS HAZARD POSES FUTURE THREAT 

RALPH D. L0REN2 Spaceflight {ISSN 0038-6340), vol. 30, Jan. 
1988, p. 4-7. 

Space debris comprises three classes: particles, fragments, and 
artifacts; here the broad characteristics of these classes (such as 
mass, size, and composition) are listed in a table. The causes of 
spacecraft destruction are discussed, including antisatellite 
weapons system testing, self-destruction in order to prevent their 
impact on populated areas of the earth's surface, and the break-up 
of the nuclear power supplies of some satellites. Radar 
obsen/ations and computer models indicate that the worst position 
for the satellite is in an 800-km orbit with an inclination of about 
120 degrees, and orbits from about 500 km to 1100 km are 
hazardous. Some of the more well-documented cases of spacecraft 
colliding with artificial space debris are analyzed. It is concluded 
that within 20 years or so it will be necessary to clear up at least 
some of the existing debris. The NASA Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle 
(OMV), which is able to reach some 2700 km above a Space 
Shuttle orbit, is discussed. A.S.

The Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) 
program is a two-phase joint USAF/NASA program consisting of 
a low Earth orbit (LEO) phase and a geosynchronous transfer 
orbit (GTO) phase. The mission has been carefully planned to 
help clarify the geospace environment picture and its effects on 
space hardware, communications, and man. CRRES instruments 
were selected for synergism, accuracy, and applicability, and will 
be cross-calibrated for consistency. They will provide data to fill 
the gaps in geospace modeling data already obtained, and will 
update and correct existing models. The chemical release 
experiments and low altitude instruments will clarify the character 
of the ionosphere in low Earth orbit and the high altitude chemical 
release experiments will improve knowledge of how trapped particle 
populations behave out as far as synchronous altitudes. The 
ionospheric studies will lead to significantly improved Earth-space 
intercommunications. Author

The external induced environment generated by space station 
activity, or more specifically by gases, particles, and light 
background is discussed. These contaminant species must be 
controlled if sensitive systems, such as solar energy collectors or 
science experiments exposed to the external environment are to 
function properly. The requirements generally set limits on the 
level of gas species, matter deposited on surfaces and light 
background levels over various spectral regions. They also address 
environment monitoring and contamination controls during 
manufacturing. Limits on effluent release and system leakages 
are in turn derived from these requirements. Author

Surfaces of interest to space vehicle heat shield design were 
struck by a 2 W argon ion laser line while subjected to supersonic 
arc jet flow conditions. Emission spectra were taken at 90 deg to 
the angle of laser incidence on the test object. Results showed 
possible weak Raman shifts which could not be directly tied to 
any particular parameter such as surface temperature or gas 
composition. The investigation must be considered exploratory in 
terms of findings. Many undesirable effects were found and 
corrected as the project progressed. For instance, initial spectra 
settings led to ghosts which were eliminated by closing the 
intermediate of filter slit of the Spex from 8 to 3 mm. Further, 
under certain conditions, plasma lines from the laser were observed. 
Several materials were also investigated at room temperature for 
Raman shifts. Results showed Raman shifts for RCC and TEOS 
coated materials. The HRSI materials showed only weak Raman 
shifts, however, substantial efforts were made in studying these 
materials. Baseline materials showed the technique to be sound. 
The original goal was to find a Raman shift for the High-temperature 
Reusable Surface Insulation (HRSI) Reaction Cured borosilicate 
Glass (RCG) coated material and tie the amplitude of this peak to 
Arc jet conditions. Weak Raman shifts may be present, however, 
time limitations prevented confirmation. Author

The creation of a useful legal regime governing international 
cooperation on space stations is examined. The basic 
characteristics and functions of the proposed NASA earth-orbiting 
Space Station are described. The bilateral agreements between 
the U.S. and Canada, Japan, and ESA for the proposed design 
and development of the Space Station, in particular the U.S.-ESA 
Memorandum of Understanding, are discussed. The need for 
government-to-government agreements to handle issues such as 
jurisdiction, control, and registration of the Space Station; 
proprietary rights; and technology transfer is studied. Consideration 
is given to the relevance of domestic law and general international 
regulations; telecommunication issues; the transportation of 
hazardous materials; and the use of nuclear power. I.F.

vol. 90. Oct. 1987, p. 26-35. 

An account is given of Soviet nonmilitary manned and 
unmanned space program exploits that often go unnoticed in the 
Western news media despite their recent public availability, in the 
wake oi the newly instituted policy of glasnost. The year 1987 is 
especially noteworthy in virtue of having witnessed the launching 
of the Soviet superbooster 'Energia'. Unmanned missions 
scheduled for the late 1980s and the 1990s encompass probes 
to the asteroid belt, to Venus, to the moons of Mars, and to Mars 
itself. Cosmonauts from Mongolia. Vietnam, Cuba, France, and 
India have participated in the 'Intercosmos' manned missions based

Future European space programs such as Eureca. Columbus, 
Hermes, Ariane 5, DRS, and scientific satellites will require a 
ground-based end-to-end operation and verification infrastructure 
of a new order of magnitude as compared with the existing ground 
infrastructure. Individual program needs and required user support 
ground segments exceed the tight budget frame available for the 
European space community. It is noted that investments are 
necessary for industrial development facilities to support the AlV 
phase, support facilities for development and operation, launch 
and landing facilities, operations facilities for mission and payload 
control, and payload data facilities for data dissemination, archiving, 
and retrieval. Cost reduction can be achieved by harmonizing the 
ground segment, common developments and reusable investments, 
as well as by rationalizing the industrial capabilities. B.J.

The European Retrievable Carrier is currently undergoing its 
development phase. The Eureca payload for its first mission is 
primarily dedicated to the field of microgravity sciences although 
it also carries astrophysics experiments and technological 
experiments in the field of electrical propulsion and intersatellite 
communications in the kA band region. Since the concept of a 
small retrievable carrier offers the advantage of frequent and 
economical reflight, ESA has initiated a number of studies which 
proved the usefulness and flexibility of the Eureca concept to 
support basic research and technology development activities in 
various scientific and technical disciplines. This paper summarizes 
the results of the various studies performed so far and reports on 
the major characteristics of the proposed enhancement to the 
present carrier concept which are intended to be implemented on 
the second flight model of Eureca which is to be procured as 
part of the Columbus program. Author

MTFF OPERATIONAL DESIGN FEATURES

21-24, 1987, Proceedings. Cape Canaveral, FL, Canaveral Council 
of Technical Societies, 1987, 18 p. 

This paper describes the main design features incorporated 
in the European Space Agency's Man-Tended Free Flyer which 
enable the MTFF to be operational on-orbit for a 30 year period 
via servicing and maintenance. The MTFF is to be serviced at the 
Station or by Hermes every six months in one of two ways - 
using man in the Pressurized Module (PM) and using robotics for 
the external equipment of the PM and the Resource Module. EVA 
is a contingency back-up to the latter. Crew servicing inside the 
PM is enhanced by the proper attention to design details allowing 
good access to the payload and subsystem equipment in the 
same manner as for the Attached Modules of the Station, that is 
by mounting all equipment in standard racks to which the crew 
have easy access. Servicing of the external items is achieved by 



mounting them in Orbital Replacement Units (ORU's) which are 
compatible with the Station and/or Hermes manipulator arms. The 
ORU's have standardized interface provisions for end effectors 
and also for attachment to their parent spacecraft. There are also 
nonstandard ORU's such as solar arrays and comms antennae. 
The MTFF has attitude/orbit control, stability and position features, 
RVD sensors and propulsive capabilities for orbit maintenance, 
transfer and rendezvous functions. Author

THE COLUMBUS SYSTEM BASELINE AND INTERFACES 

FRANK LONGHURST (ESA, Noordwijk, Netherlands) IN: Space 
Congress, 24th, Cocoa Beach, FL, Apr. 21-24, 1987, Proceedings. 
Cape Canaveral, FL, Canaveral Council of Technical Societies, 
1987, 20 p. 

The paper traces the evolution of the Columbus system baseline 
up to the present time and describes the most significant changes 
introduced into this baseline as a result of the definition process 
itself and as a consequence of changes introduced into other 
major systems with which Columbus has major external interfaces. 
It is noted that the definition process for the Columbus system is 
now reaching a critical stage, with convergence to a specific set 
of flight element configurations a high-priority objective, to allow 
the depth of definition required to enter into the development 
phase of the program. In addition, in several areas the definition 
of the external interfaces to other major systems under parallel 
definition is not yet very mature and requires sepcial emphasis. It 
is concluded that the studies performed to date have created a 
very comprehensive data base, which will ease the task of 
convergence once major program decisions are made. B.J.

The main technical features of the Columbus Attached 
Pressurized Module are deschbed. Its internal configuration is a 
doubly symmetric cross section of four identical rack envelopes 
separated by standoffs carrying utilities. Its purpose is to provide 
resources for materials, fluid, and life sciences payloads for over 
a 30-year lifetime. The on-orbit payload accommodation is for up 
to 10,000 kg housed in up to 25 cu m of rack volume, with 10 
kW power and 100 mbits/sec data transfer. Also described is the 
Columbus Man-Tended Free Flyer (MTFF) Pressurized Module. 
Being highly common with the Columbus Attached Module, it has 
system and subsystem architectures which will be very similar to 
those of the Station Modules. B.J.

An increasing number of advanced space technologies require 
in-orbit demonstration as the final stage in their development before 
they can be integrated, without excessive risk, into new projects 
or embraced by industry in commercial ventures. To cope with 
those needs, ESA has already initiated the first phase (1987-1990) 
of its In-Orbit Technology Demonstration Program (TDP). This 
Program will extend well into the 1990s, as envisaged in the 
European Long-Term Space Plan, with a steadily increasing number 
of in-orbit tests being conducted each year. Such in-orbit testing 
reduces the risk element in more complex missions and provides 
European industry with the rapid flight testing of components and 
subsystems that it needs to compete in world markets. The content, 
status and planning of the present and future TDP phase shall be 
presented. Author

This paper defines the European Polar Platform mission phases 
and the operations required in each of these in order to achieve 
the mission objectives. The constraints on the Platform and the 
limitations on life/growth due to the performance of the service 
vehicle are examined. It is found that it is feasible to launch a 
Platform carrying a payload in excess of 2500 Kg and maintain it 
over a period of 30 years by servicing it with the Shuttle every 
three years. It is also found that Platform propulsion systems which 
allow some fonward loading of propellant enable the full service 
vehicle upload capability to be utilized every service and greater 
operational flexibility. Author

The maintenance concepts for a manned space station with a 
conttnous 30-year mission are examined. To simplify the 
maintenance tasks to be performed by the crew in the first phase 
of station operation, at which no special maintenance personnel 
will be allocated, use of the so-catled orbital replaceable units 
(ORUs) is planned. An on-board videomonitor system is foreseen, 
which will include files, In digital optical format, to supply the 
technical information needed, with the use of bar codes allowing 
quick identification of the parts and quick retrieval of the 
instructions. The paper also discusses the data base composition, 
simulation of operations, and the supply concepts to support the 
maintenance and the environment of a space station. 1. 8.

The factors affecting the configuration of the ESA's Columbus 
Polar Platform are examined with particular reference to the payload 
mission, the spacecraft launch vehicle, the servicing method, and 
more general constraints. The reference requirements for the Polar 
Platform result in a spacecraft configuration that is very different 
from any preceding European program. The planned extended 
spacecraft lifetime and currently baselined associated servicing 
scenario are major configuration drivers; any major change would 
require a reassessment of the configuration design. V.L.

announced that extensive scientific and physiological experiments 
would be conducted. The flight ended in a crash and the death 
of the lone crewmember, but it has been surmised that it was to 
have docked with a Soyuz 2 that remained unlaunched. In 
subsequent years, Soyuz was redesigned to operate as a crew 
ferry vehicle for space stations such as Salyut in LEO, begining in 
1971. Soyuz will remain operational until a Soviet space shuttle-type 
vehicle becomes available for manned missions. O.C,

One of the subsystems common to all three elements in the 
Columbus Space Station program is the Data Management 
Subsystem, DMS. The DMS is based on distributed computers 
conencted through a Local Area Network, LAN. In general the 
DMS is required to withstand one internal failure and still work in 
a full operational mode. This means that all equipment will at 
least be duplicated. The computers have to have a very high 
error self-detection coverage since no external equipment is 
available for this purpose. A failing computer will shut down itself 
after an error has been detected. The other computers on the 
LAN are then responsible for the reconfiguration. This paper will 
in general describe the fault tolerance concept proposed for the 
Columbus DMS and in particular detail the method to achieve the 
high error self-detection coverage in the computers. Author

The 'servicing' concept comprises the Hermes approach maneuver, 
the proximity operation, the capture and berthing process of the 
spacecraft to the servicing facilities, the actual servicing activities, 
the refueling operation, and the deployment and activation of the 
spacecraft for subsequent mission. The study demonstrated that 
the Hermes is capable of performing the servicing missions of the

Eureca-type spacecraft. The in-orbit operations and maneuvering 
with a small spacecraft like Hermes with an overall mass of 12.5 
t can be kept to a minimum. The direct insertion of Hermes into 
the Eureca operational orbit provides the advantage of reducing 
the Eureca operations, so that the refueling for a two-year science 
mission will be not required. I.S.

B1 when ESA, on behalf of its member states, indicated to NASA 
its candidate Space Station elements for further study in phase 
B2. The ESA proposal contains the following suggestions for 
hardware participation in the international Space Station: (1) a 
pressurized module permanently attached to the Space Station; 
(2) a man-tended free flying (pressurized module + resource 
module); (3) a polar platform, and (4) a co-orbiting platform. This 
paper addresses programmatic aspects of Columbus, providing 
background for the selection of the proposed European candidates

update and payload growth. Over a period of 10 years, the payload 
power requirement grows from 5 to 10 kW, mass from 2.4 to 5 
tonnes, and data rate from 300 M bits per s to 500 M bits/s. The 
platform is designed in three major sections, a propulsion module, 
a utilities section and the payload section. The propulsion module 
contains sufficient propellant for boost from Shuttle delivery orbit 
to operational orbit, deboost from operational orbit to Shuttle 
service orbit, and a two-year orbital stay period. The cost 
effectiveness of servicable platforms is compared withthat of 
nonmaintainable spacecraft. Under the criteria of payload mass 
carrying capability, payload power provision and payload data 
transmission the platform is considerably more effective than 
expendable spacecraft. Author

The design and operation of the Columbus Resource Module 
(RM) are discussed, summarizing the results of phase B1 studies 
undertaken for ESA. The reference configuration of the RM 
comprises an orbital maneuvering section (including AOCS and 
propulsion system), a power section (400 sq m of solar panels 
providing 14 kW to payloads), and an orbital replacement section 
(accommodating payload modules). In the Space Station IOC, the 
RM will (1) be joined to (and provide utilities for) a two-segment 
version of the Columbus Pressurized Module to form the 
Man-Tended Free Flyer and (2) pick up payload carrier elements 
from the core Station to operate as a coorbiting platform; expanded 
RM functions are planned for the AOC. Consideration is given to 
the RM subsystems, operations and utilization, technology 
development, and growth potential (e.g., commonality with 
Columbus Polar Platform utilities and propulsion modules). T.K.

The results of R&D studies of electric power systems (EPSs) 
for the ESA Columbus program are discussed and illustrated with 
extensive diagrams and drawings. The three major EPS 
requirements for the Space Station IOC are (1) 8 kW (in both sun 
and shadow phases) for the Polar Platform, (2) 30 kW for the 
Pressurized Module when attached to the Station core, and (3) 
about 8 kW for the Man-Tended Free Flyer. The current EPS 
reference configuration is a 150-V dc system comprising a primary 
power assembly (solar array, power conditioner, and battery), a 
power distribution assembly, and power interface units (for the 
Space Station, the Shuttle Orbiter, Ariane, and Hermes). The effects 
of LEO on the EPSs are indicated, and the criteria to be considered 
in selecting established and new technologies for the major EPS 
assemblies are examined in detail. T.K.

to be considered include commonality of design among PPF, RM, 
and enhanced Eureca; stowage volume and weight; rigidity; AOCS 
constraints; complexity and reliability; maintainability; the Orbital 
Replacement Unit philosophy, and cost. The equipment airlock is 
a self-contained unit of internal diameter 980 mm to be attached 
to an aperture of the PM and controlled from within. It is based 
on the Spacelab airlock but has electric-motor drive and must

The International Operations Concept Working Group (lOCWG) 
developed the attached 'Level A Operations Management Concept' 
for the Space Station System, This document is the culmination 
of a year's effort starting in April 1985. The concept has evolved 
through many discussions and reviews by Space Station program 
offices at all NASA levels; by other NASA program offices and 
Field Centers; and by cooperating agencies in Europe (ESA), Japan, 
and Canada, who all provided the membership of the lOCWG. In 
the environment in which the concept will be applied a number of 
issues remain for resolution: e.g., the timing of the formation of 
an operations organization, decision rules at the strategic level, 
use of other launch vehicles, questions of ownership, and the 
scheme for the sharing of operations costs. The Concept is deemed 
sufficiently flexible to accommodate various alternatives. Ongoing 
work addresses the definition of an actual management structure, 
subsequent assignment of roles and missions to be performed, 
and discussion of remaining differences among the various 
cooperating agencies in the Concept document itself. The following 
May 6, 1 986 version is then that issued by the NASA chairman of 
the lOCWG. Author

In this paper, a linear quadratic design and a technique to 
define a quadratic Lyapunov function from the positive solution of 
N decoupled Riccati algebraic eqautions are used to stabilize 
nonlinear, time-invariant, large-scale systems by local state 
feedback and to determine the stability domain. For 'minimal 
strongly connected systems' and other systems with similar 
properties, the method is quite effective and the procedure is 
simple. The method gives better results than others with regard 
to the decentralized stabilization of a large-scale telescope. CD.

The mechanism of luminescence of a narrow stratospheric layer 
along the horizon is studied. This luminescence was observed on 
June 30, 1 982 from the Salyut orbital station at moonset over the 
equatorial Pacific. The effect is shown to be due to moonlight 
scattering on aerosols supplied by the El Chichon eruption in the

The Mir orbital station is the third generation of the Soviet 
orbital stations, on which complicated scientific and technical 
research and experiments were conducted in space for 15 years. 
The successful accomplishment of this complex flight demonstrated 
the high degree of reliability of Soviet space technology, of the 
methods for controlling the flight, the unlimited possibilities for 
further development and improvement, and for increasing the 
efficiency of scientific research. The launch of the Mir station laid 
the foundation for the establishment in orbit of permanently active, 
manned scientific research complexes. Scientific research on the 
Earth's natural resources and on astrophysical objects, as well as 
medicine and biology will assume permanency. The production of 
alloys and crystals, medicines free from allergens, and various 
biological preparations will gradually reach an industrial scale. The 
orbital complexes will consist of a large number of modules 
including ones flying apart from the base block and space tugs 
will make flights between the modules to service them. B.G.

The Soviet Salyut orbital stations were the first to carry X-ray 
telescopes into space. The Mir station offers still greater 
opportunities for astronomical observations by ensuring high 
guidance accuracy in the automatic regime. Even more important, 
it extends the period of observations without impairing other 
research programs. The X-ray telescopes will operate within a 
wide band of energies, making it possible to solve in principle 
astrophysical tasks unattainable for the available space-based 
telescopes. Equipment and instruments for the Mir X-ray 
observatory were developed and manufactured through the 
collective efforts of the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, West 
Germany, and the European Space Agency. The design and 
advantages of the telescope are discussed. B.G.

Three furnaces for directional solidification, artificial composites, 
and in situ composites for the Columbus space station microgravity 
environment are proposed. A gradient furnace limited to 1300 C, 
fully instrumented and dedicated to basic research can be 
accommodated in a single rack. The limited temperature leads 
mainly to gradient restrictions for materials with a good therinal 
conductivity (Al, Ag, Cu). A second, higher temperature gradient 
furnace, dedicated to applied research and preindustrial 



development, has a heating chamber with larger cavity and 2000 
C maximum temperature. An isothermal furnace (2000 C maximum 
temperature and at least 100 mm sample diameter) is dedicated 
mainly to glass processes. To maxirtiize the efficiency of such a 
furnace a positioning device may be implemented. The power needs 
of the last two furnaces are limited by the Columbus capacities, 
consequently they are accommodated in the same high-powered 
double rack and are run in sequence. ESA

The major purpose of the studies reported in this article was 
to determine the antibiotic sensitivity of opportunistic 
microorganisms among the autoflora of astronauts by in vitro 
cultivation in orbital flight. Experiments were performed on the 
Salyut-7 spacecraft during a visit by a French astronaut utilizing 
S. aureus and E. coli isolated from the astronaut before the flight. 
Antibiotic sensitivity of the microorganisms was determined by 
double serial dilution. S. aureus were tested with oxacillin, 
chloramphenicol and erythromycin, E. coli-with kanamycin and 
colistin. The toxicity, immunogenicity and serotype membership of 
three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also determined. 
The antibiotic sensitivity of the microorganisms was found to be 
slightly higher under orbital conditions. Ultrastructural studies 
performed after the flight showed no significant morphologic 
changes in the E. coli, but some thickening of the cell walls, 
particularly in S. aureus. Characteristics of the P. aeruginosa were 
found to be stable and unaltered by space flight. Author

The Columbus Space Station scenario, paytoad requirements, 
general system requirements, and design objectives are outiined. 
The system concept is descrit>ed. The requirements are primarily 
driven by the interfacing system, i.e., tfie Manned Space Station 
(MSS), the Shuttle Space Transport System (STS) and the 
prospective payloads. Further requirements result from the inherent 
needs of tf>e Columbus system itself, and from technical and 
operatk>nal constraints. The Columtxjs concept, in its initial phases, 
depends on U.S. resources like STS. MSS, and TDRS. but it is 
also adaptable to a potential future European space station %vith 
elements which are not yet in the Columbus scenario. This applies 
to the prifK^ipal concepts of the elements and to the development 
of subsystem hardware and software. It is shown that the system 
concept meets design requirements. ESA

A computer system to simulate space operations of systems 
such as Columbus and Hermes was designed. The so-called 
European Robotic Operations Simulator (EUROSIM) is a long 
life-time simulator for design, verification, test, and training 
applicable to general in-orbit servicing operations although tailored 
towards space robotic and manipulator operations. The EUROSIM 
possibilities include static visualization of orbit characteristics, 
reference frames, and local geometries; representation of 
dominating environmental conditions; kinematic and dynamic 
analysis of generic space elements models; and development of 
simulation modules in a software development environment. The 
basic simulation process is a run-time module prepared off-line 
with the help of extensive user support facilities. Requirements 
imposed on user-support facilities include an intelligent simulation 
model editor which allows the dynamic and geometric model of a 
real world or hypothetical system to be built up from a library of 
modules, each representing a physical subsystem, component or 
unit. ESA

A facility to provide software-based simulation of Columbus 
flight configurations was developed. It features real-time capability 
and flight modularity/fidelity to satisfy the wide scope of user 
requirements through all program phases. Staggered 
implementation with early simulation through all design levels 
ensures an optimum feedfonvard/feedback to the design process, 
reducing the risk and cost for late changes. User friendliness 
through a broad spectrum of simulation tasks is a governing design 
goal. Without compromising user aspects, low risk 
techniques/technology with growth potential are employed. An 
import/export concept with central management, development, and 
services ensures a consistent quality of simulation and cost 
effective development/ utilization. ESA

Requirements for the simulation software of the European 
Robotics Operations Simulator (EUROSIM) are discussed. A 
detailed complete specification of the simulation software is not 
possible due to the wide scope of EUROSIM. Therefore, detailed 
specifications were given for the kernel model software, i.e., the 
manipulator models, and high level descriptions for the related 
models and the simulation definition and control support software. 



From the study results it should be possible to define a conceptual 
design of the system/ software architecture. With that design and 
the baseline requirements detailed software requirements can be 
specified. The various software elements, identified to be part of 
the simulation subsystem, were specified and development and 
cost estimates were given in order to arrive at the basic non 
real-time and real-time operational capabilities. ESA

Requirements for the software simulation of manipulator 
space-operations, and three methods of dynamic simulation are 
reviewed. The Lagrangian method is best suited for a simulation 
which is mainly for analyzing the dynamic behavior of the 
manipulator arm and for controller-design because of its clear 
formulation. The dynamic influences are computed explicitly, so 
thay can be isolated or their contribution to the total dynamic 
forces seen. However, the Lagrangian formulation requires more 
computational effort than the others. Kane's method is the most 
effective as to computational effort. However, automatic generation 
of the simulation equations in an effective way is not possible. 
Kane's formulation is well suited for real-time simulations where 
the manipulator-design is already fixed and no additional results 
(like forces in the bearings) only simulation of motion, is required. 
For all other applications the Newton-Euler method is best. Its 
main advantage is that the forces and torques can be computed 
explicitly at every point on the manipulator. So the interaction 
with the environment can be simulated very easily. ESA

The Exobiological and Radiation Assembly (ERA) is a multi-user 
life science facility designed to support investigations into the 
effects of the radiation environment at low Earth orbit upon living 
organisms. Two classes of investigation are possible with ERA; 
the first group concerns the effects selected bandwidths of solar 
radiation, and the second concerns the effects of HZE particles, 
upon living material. The Botany Facility is proposed as a multiuser 
reflyable life science facility, to support research into long term 
response of higher and lower plants to the microgravity and 
radiation environments encountered at low Earth orbit; under the 
appropriate circumstances these same facilities may be used to 
conduct entomological investigations. Both facilities are compatible 
with EURECA. ESA 



in geocentric orbits at altitudes ranging between 200 km and 
geosynchronous altitude are examined. Minimum time to complete 
rendezvous is studied for purposes of expediting crew patient 
transfer to an orbiting medical base station (MBS) for the 
stabilization of trauma and definitive care. The vehicle to be used 
for the crew patient transfer to the MBS is the space ambulance 
vehicle (SAV). The SAV is assumed to use two velocity impulses 
to complete rendezvous maneuvers between an SS and the MBS: 
an accelerating impulse when departing the SS and a second 
decelerating impulse prior to docking with the MBS. 
Recommendations are made concerning the planning of space 
operations which will reduce both time and propulsive energy for 
rendezvous maneuvers. It is suggested that throttleable engines 
be used when transferring a crew patient whose trauma could be 
exacerbated by excessive acceleration of the carrier vehicle.

change in the orbital ir>clination of an Orbital Transfer Vehicle

which were the axial acceleration and the aerodynamic heating

cfiange in ottital irx^lination was investigated. A relation between 
time in the hover orbit and payload to LEO was established. The

was checked for several runs ar)d a possible thrusting procedure 
to increase the plane change and still get to LEO was suggested. 
Finally, the sensitivity of various target parameters to controllable

The OrtMtal Maneuvering Vehicle (OMV) presents a series of 
challenges Xo the human operator. Some are unique to the OMV 
system itself, arxj are largely due to remote control versus control 
from the cockpit. Other challer>ges are not necessarily unique to 
the OMV. but are characteristic of many man-machine space flight 
systems. All of these challenges affect the operator's ability to 
perform his portion of the mission, and could lead to human error 
wfuch might jeopardize the vehicle, mission, or both. It is imperative 



to make every effort to design the control and displays to facilitate 
the operator's task. The experimental program shouM address 
the perceptual, mediational, arKJI motor dimensk>ns of operator 
performance. With this in mind, a literature review with relevant 
design considerations was initiated, and a comprehensive outiine 
of control/display parameters were developed. Out of this, a series 
of questions not answered in the literature was derived whrch can 
he converted into experimental protocols for the simulation 
program. A major task of the aircraft pilot as well as the OMV 
operator is prediction. Certain display principles have proved to 
enhance the pilot's ability to predk:!. A brief examination of some

The designing of Space Shuttie modules and equipment in 
order to provkje a stimulating and efficient work atmosphere and 
a pleasant living environment Is examined. The habitation module 
for the eight crew members is divkJed into four areas: ceiling, 
fkxK, port, and startxsard. The module is to consist of crew quarters, 
a wardroom, a galley, a personal hygiene facility, a health 
mainter^ance facility, ar>d stowage areas. There is a conelation 
between the furx^tion of the module arid its location; for example 
the galley will t>e near tiie wardroom and the persor>al hygiene 
facility near the crew quarters. The designs of the equipment for 
crew accommodation and of the equipment to be maintained and 
repaired by the crew will be standarized. The design and functions 
of the crew and equipment restraints, crew mobility aids, racks to 
contain equipment, and functional units are described. IF.

Orbiting space stations raise unprecendented demands on crev*^ 
performance and group interaction. Previously, Antarctic studies 
revealed evidence of deterioration in social relationships and work 
effectiveness, particularly during the long winter; a decline was 
observed in compatibility, group pride, teamwork, and group 
efficiency, and groups with the greatest decline had the lowest 
morale and experienced most difficulty in keeping essential 
equipment operating. These findings are consistent with reports 
from Soviet Salyut missions. It is noted that. In spite of these 
reports, the interpersonal criterion is virtually ignored in the current 
Space Station planning. Directions for possible training and team 
development are suggested. I.S.

EVA activities associated with operations of the Columbus space 
station and the Hermes manned reusable spacecraft require space 
suits for ESA astronauts characterized by high mobility and 
dexterity, exceptional protection against radiation, thermal loads, 
and micrometeoroids, and good communications equipment. Such 
suits must also minimize donning/doffing time and prebreathing 
requirements. Attention is presently given to operational 
performance criteria that must be met by these suits in the course 
of EVA concerned with Orbit Replaceable Units on such ESA 
spacecraft as the enhanced Eureca platform, as well as to the

A frame by frame analysis of current video-tape recordings 
reveals that the behavioral adaptation process of the cosmonaut 
to weightlessness is achieved via adaptation of the motor units 
patterns according to the movement direction, differential 
responses in the movement kinetics according to the attention 
level of the cosmonaut while performing the task, and to the 
needed accuracy. Results are presented pertaining to the 
cosmonaut's posture and body orientation. It is found that the 
cosmonaut systematically orientates according to visual references

systems adapt to microgravity, how gravity has shaped and affected 
life on earth, and further the understanding of basic biological 
phenomena. This would include multigeneration experiments on 
the effects of microgravity on the reproduction, development, 
growth, physiology, behavior, and aging of organisms. To achieve 
these research goals, a modular habitat system and on-board

plane for the EVA aspects. The leading factors whk:h affect the 
space suit design are presented and analyzed at the tight of the

describes the problems which drive the onboard training 
requirements. Three modes of training are described as solutions 
to these protHems. Examples of potential implementation 
techniques for the training, using new technologies, are included. 
The three proposed modes of onboard trainirig are: (1) an off-line 
capability to be used for computer-assisted instruction and 
procedural reviews. (2) a job performance assistance mode to 
provide rapid access to instruction and other forms of on-line

The energy expenditure of the Shuttle Flight 61 -B crewmembers 
during the extravehicular performance of Experimental Assembly 
of Structures in EVA (EASE) and Assembly Concept of Construction 
of Space Structures (ACCESS) construction system tasks are 
reported. These data consist of metabolic rate time profiles 
correlated with specific EASE and ACCESS tasks and crew 
comments. Average extravehicular activity metabolic rates are 
computed and compared with those reported from previous Apollo, 
Shylab, and Shuttle flights. These data reflect total energy 
expenditure and not that of individual muscle groups such as hand 
and forearm. When correlated with specific EVA tasks and 
subtasks, the metabolic profile data is expected to be useful in 
planning future EVA protocols. For example, after experiencing 
high work rates arid apparent overheating during some Gemini 
EVAs, it was found useful to carefully monitor work rates in 
subsequent flights to assess the adequacy of cooling garments 
and as an aid to preplanning EVA procedures. This presentation 
is represented by graphs and charts. Author

An overview is given of the basis for an analysis of combustable 
materials and potential ignition sources in a spacecraft. First, the 
burning process is discussed in terms of the production of the fire 
signatures normally associated with detection devices. These 
include convected and radiated thermal energy, particulates, and 
gases. Second, the transport processes associated with the 
movement of these from the fire to the detector, along with the 
important phenomena which cause the level of these signatures 
to be reduced, are described. Third, the operating characteristics 
of the individual types of detectors which influence their response 
to signals, are presented. Finally, vulnerability analysis using 
predictive fire modeling techniques is discussed as a means to 
establish the necessary response of the detection system to provide 
the level of protection required in the application. Author

It was concluded that it is essential that NASA develop a 
comprehensive approach to fire extinguishment and inerting in 
spacecraft environments. Electronic equipment might be easily 
protected through use of an onboard inert gas generating system. 
The use of Halon 1301 presents serious technological challenges 
for agent cleanup and removal of the toxic and corrosive products 
of combustion. Nitrogen pressurization, while effective, probably 
presents a serious weight penality. The use of liquid water sprays 
appears to be the most effective approach to general purpose 
spacecraft fire protection. Author

Spacecraft fire safety may be improved by the use of a 
fire-retardant atmosphere in occupied spaces. Low concentrations 
of oxygen can protect humans from fire damage by reducing the 
rate and spread of combustion, but care must be taken to avoid 
the hypoxic effects of oxygen-lean atmospheres. Crews can live 
and work in 1 1 percent oxygen if barometric pressure were adjusted 
to maintain the partial pressure of oxygen above 16 kPa. Eleven 
percent oxygen should prevent most types of fires, since 1 5 percent 
oxygen retards the combustion of paper And 13 percent oxygen 
extinguishes pentane flames. Test results indicate that seated 
humans can perform mental tasks in atmospheres containing 11.5 
percent oxygen. Although this strategy of fire safety is under 
consideration for submarines, it could be adapted to spacecraft 
once operational procedures define a maximum hyperbaric pressure 
and fire research defines the effects of reduced oxygen 
concentrations on tombustion in low gravity environments.

Acceptability limits and sampling and monitoring strategies for 
airborne particles in spacecraft were considered. Based on 
instances of eye and respiratory tract irritation reported by Shuttle 
flight crews, the following acceptability limits for airborne particles 
were recommended: for flights of 1 week or less duration (1 mg/cu 
m for particles less than 10 microns in aerodynamic diameter 
(AD) plus 1 mg/cu m for particles 10 to 100 microns in AD); and 
for flights greater than 1 week and up to 6 months in duration 
(0.2 mg/cu m for particles less than 10 microns in AD plus 0.2 
mg/cu m for particles 10 to 100 microns in AD. These numerical 
limits were recommended to aid in spacecraft atmosphere design 
which should aim at particulate levels that are a low as reasonably 
achievable. Sampling of spacecraft atmospheres for particles 
should include size-fractionated samples of to 10, 10 to 100, 
and greater than 100 micron particles for mass concentration 
measurement and elementary chemical analysis by nondestructive 
analysis techniques. Morphological and chemical analyses of single 
particles should also be made to aid in identifying airborne 
particulate sources. Air cleaning systems based on inertial 
collection principles and fine particle collection devices based on 
electrostatic precipitation and filtration should be considered for 
incorporation into spacecraft air circulation systems. It was also 
recommended that research be carried out in space in the areas 
cf health effects and particle characterization. Author

It is necessary that an adequate microbiology capability be 



provided as part of the Health Maintenance Facility (HMF) to 
support expected microbial disease events and environmental 
monitoring during long periods of space flight. The application of 
morphological and biochemical studies to confirm the presence of 
certain bacterial and fungal disease agents are currently available 
and under consideration. This confirmation would be facilitated 
through employment of serological methods to aid in the 
identification of bacterial, fungal, and viral agents. A number of 
serological approaches are currently being considered, including 
the use of Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) 
technology, which could be utilized during microgravlty conditions. 
A solid phase, membrane supported ELISA for the detection of 
Legionella pneumophila, an expected disease agent, was 
developed to show a potential model system that would meet the 
HMF requirements and specifications for the future space station. 
These studies demonstrate the capability of membrane supported

was examined. Waste electrolysis experiments were performed in 
a single compartment reactor, on platinum electrodes, to determine 
conditions likely to maximize the efficiency of oxidation of fecal 
waste material to C02. The maximum current efficiencies for 
artificial fecal waste electrolysis to C02 was found to be around 
50 percent in the test apparatus. Experiments involving fecal waste 
oxidation on platinum indicates that electrodes with a higher 
overvoltage for oxygen evolution such as lead dioxide will give a 
larger effective potential range for organic oxidation reactions. An 
electrochemical packed column reactor was constructed with lead 
dioxide as electrode material. Preliminary experiments were 
performed using a packed-bed reactor and continuous flow 
techniques showing this system may be effective in complete 
oxidation of fecal material. The addition of redox mediator 
Ce(3 + )/Ce{4-f ) enhances the oxidation process of biomass 
components. Scientific literature relevant to biomass and fecal

Thirty-five volunteers responded when they first perceived an 
increase in apparent size of a collimated, 2-D image of an Orbiter 
vehicle. The test variables of interest included the presence of a 
fixed angular reticle within the field of view (FOV); three initial 
Orbiter distances; three constant Orbiter approach velocities 
corresponding to 1.6, 0.8, and 0.4 percent of the initial distance 
per second; and two background starfield velocities. It was found 
that: (1) at each initial range, increasing approach velocity led to 
a larger distance between the eye and Orbiter image at threshold; 
(2) including the fixed reticle in the FOV produced a smaller distance 
between the eye and Orbiter image at threshold; and (3) increasing 



background star velocity during this judgment led to a smaller 
distance between the eye and Orbiter image at threshold. The 
last two findings suggest that other detail within the FOV may 
compete for available attention which otherwise would be available 
for judging image expansion; thus, the target has to approach the 
observer nearer than otherwise if these details were present. These 
findings are discussed in relation to previous research and possible 
underlying mechanisms. Author

Cardiovascular examinations were performed on three

ultrasound device includes a real-time B mode imaging, a time 
motion mode, a Doppler and a duplex mode echo-Doppler. This 
system was used to study the cardiac function and the peripheral 
circulation. The main hemodynamic parameters (cardiac output, 
carotid and femoral blood flow, vascular resistances) were 
measured several times preflight, inflight, and during the recovery 
period- The individual variations are presented as percentage of 
the basal preflight value. It is concluded that the hemodynamic 
changes observed during the flight concern physiological and

A medical laboratory for the Mir Space Station is proposed. 
Physiological studies concentrate on sensory systems, respiration 
and circulation regulation, hormonal and fluid-electrolyte 
metabolism, musculoskeletal system, digestive system, and 
psychophysiological status. It is planned to study neuro-reflex and 
neuro-humoral mechanisms of regulation of physiological systems 
at different time intervals of exposure to microgravity using invasive 
methods that cannot be applied to man as well as to investigate 
subtle morphofunctional changes in animals. Biological experiments 
concentrate on cell biology and population biology to clarify the 
specific function and evolution of living systems in the absence of 
gravity and to ascertain the general pattern of gravity effects on 
living systems. Animal experiments to develop the principles and 
tactics of surgical manipulations and treatment of pathologies such 
as local inflammation and wounds, and bone regeneration are 
planned. ESA

Modifications of structure and function of bacteria, particularly 
in response to antibiotics, induced by spacecraft environments 
were examined on Spacelab and Salyut. The increase of antibiotic 
resistance may be due to a stimulating effect on the cell 
multiplication in space conditions, as reported for several other 
microorganisms. It may also be due to changes in bacterial cell 
wall structure and its permeability as proposed by Tixador (1981), 
in a study of electrolyte content in Paramecium aurelia. It cannot 
be ruled out that the two hypotheses may have to be combined 
to explain this phenomenon of transitory increase of resistance in 
antibiotics. ESA

Legal questions regarding jurisdiction aboard the International 
Space Station are discussed from a U.S. perspective. Topics 
examined include (1) national jurisdiction over the Space Station 
and/or its components, (2) jurisdiction of courts over specific cases 
or controversies, (3) choice-of-law questions resulting from the 
adjudication of Space Station disputes, and (4) the sharing of 
jurisdiction between the U.S. federal government and the states. 
It is suggested that international lawyers have some relevant 
experience regarding areas (2) and (3), but that some rules should 
probably be developed beforehand due to the highly visible and 
political nature of international space ventures. Resolution of the 
primarily political and technological conflicts foreseen in area (1) 
by mechanisms similar to NATO Status of Forces Agreements is 
recommended, and the need for Congressional limits on state 
legislation to prevent problems in area (4) is indicated. T.K.

elimination of tax and import/export barriers, construction and 
maintenance of a space infrastructure (the Space Station) with 
some support from user fees, opportunity for proof-of-concept 
experiments on MPS technologies, and clear and fair regulation 
of space-laboratory management questions. T.K.

Potential legal questions arising from commercial activities 
aboard an international space station are examined in a general 
review. The lack of clearly defined regulations governing stations 
made up of component modules belonging to different nations is 
stressed, and it is argued that simple application of national 
jurisdictions over activities on each module is unrealistic. A system 
of international regulations based on pragmatic (cost) factors is 
recommended, and possible provisions of such an agreement are 
discussed. T.K.

Future spacecraft will be sent on missions to complete the 
exploration of the solar system, to return samples from celestial 
bodies, record the process of creation of stars, galaxies, and the 
universe itself, to provide a continuous record of earth processes, 
and to maintain vital space communications. A key ingredient to 
projecting the future is to comprehend the historic record and to 
understand the significance of trends. This paper focuses on 
spacecraft cost and life trends, as well as those of the major 
subsystems. Throughout the history of the 'space age' there has 



been significant progress in the performance of spacecraft and 
their subsystems. However, various aspects of spacecraft 
performance lag behind what is technically feasible by a 
considerable margin. In addition, examination of the historical trend 
implies that future spacecraft will likely continue to be relatively 
unique in their design features. This is in contrast to the technically 
realizable future attributes such as large space platforms, 
modularity, system autonomy and on-orbit repair and servicing.

important modifications since the completion of the study, 
particularly the servicing strategy, results nevertheless confirm the 
technical viability of utilization. It concludes that any utilization 
organization should support rather than lead the user community, 
who are found to be both mature and accessible. Author

RAM ACCELERATOR DIRECT LAUNCH SYSTEM FOR SPACE

The ram accelerator, a chemically-propelled mass driver, is 
presented as a new approach for directly launching 
acceleration-insensitive pay-loads into LEO. The cargo vehicle 
resembles the centerbody of a conventional ramjet and travels 
through a launch tube filled with a premixed gaseous fuel and 
oxidizer mixture. The tube acts as the outer cowling of the ramjet 
and the combustion process travels with the vehicle. Two modes 
of ram accelerator drive are described, which when used in 
sequence, are capable of accelerating the cargo vehicle to 10 
km/sec. The requirements for placing a 2000 kg vehicle with 50 
percent payload fraction into a 400 km orbit, with a minimum of 
on-board rocket propellant for circularization maneuvers, are 
examined. It is shown that aerodynamic heating during atmospheric 
transit results in very little ablation of the nose. Both direct and 
indirect orbital insertion scenarios are investigated, and a three-step 
maneuver consisting of two burns and aerobraktng is found to 
minimize the on-board propellant mass. A scenario involving a 
parking orbit below the desired final orbit is suggested as a means 
to increase the flexibility of the mass launch concept. Author

A class of two-stage reusable ballistic Space Freighters with 
nominal launch masses of 7000 metric tons for transport of heavy 
payloads into low earth orbits is investigated in this paper with 
spcial regard to vehicle cost efficiency. A life-cycle cost analysis 
shows that Space Freighters with a conventional aluminum 
structure offer significantly lower specific transportation costs than 
today's systems for large payload markets and high launch rates. 
Advanced structural materials and thermal protection systems offer 
further important reductions not only with regard to vehicle mass 
but also with respect to specific transportation cost. A phased 
introduction of these technologies is cost efficient for larger 
programs with more than 100 vehicles. Author

While the adverse effects of acceleration forces upon the growth 
of 'perfect' crystals were recognized long ago, it is still not known 
how low an acceleration, as a function of frequency, should be to 
permit the undisturbed growth of crystals. The proposed twin 
experiment is considered a first step toward answering that 
question. Two identicial crystal growth experiments will be carried 
out simultaneously onboard a spacecraft; the first will be mounted 
directly to the spacecraft structure, the second will be suspended 
by soft springs that filter out all disturbances above a specified 
acceleration and frequency. Accelerometers attached to each 
experiment will measure and record the accelerations encountered 
by each experiment. After-flight comparisons of the two crystals 
will provide an indication of the effects caused by two different 
levels of accelerations. Author

A dynamic user interface is suggested for the 
electronically-generated graphics being developed to supplant 
paper information media in Space Station operations; this interface 
is claimed to offer smart, responsive assistance that can render 
procedure execution faster, more accurate, and more acceptable 
to crew members than fixed-geometry displays. The central concept 
of the proposed system is that real-time software can extract 
information from an operations data base and construct a detailed 
display indicating precisely what procedural steps and support data 
must be displayed at each stage of execution. O.C.

steps the U.S. can take to regain its leadership position in space. 
After briefly examining the space flight technology and the 
development processes utilized by the two space programs, it is 
suggested that the U.S. become more evolutionary in its programs 
and more streamlined in its development practices. Most important, 
however, is the gaining of public support for a robust, long-range 
space plan. The key is effective communication with the American

complement to the Space Station. The new suit is to operate at 
the Station's constant pressure of one earth atmosphere, and 
should be maintainable in orbit. Experiments conducted at

No longer limited to occasional spectaculars, space has 
become an essential, almost commonplace dimension of national 
life. Among other things, space is an arena of competition with 
our allies and adversaries, a place of business, a field of research, 
and an avenue of cooperation with our allies. The space station 
will play a critical role in each of these endeavors. Perhaps the 
most significant feature of the space station, essential to its utility 
for science, commerce, and technology, is the permanent nature 
of its crew. The space station will build upon the tradition of 
employing new capabilities to explore further and question deeper, 
and by providing a permanent presence, the station should 
significantly increase the opportunities for conducting research in 
space. Economic productivity is, in part, a function of technical 
innovation. A major thrust of the station design effort is devoted 
to enhancing performance through advanced technology. The 
space station represents the commitment of the United States to 
a future in space. Perhaps most importantly, as recovery from the 
loss of Challenger and its crew continues, the space station 
symbolizes the national determination to remain undeterred by 
tragedy and to continue exploring the frontiers of space. B.G.

Described is a two-phase approach to allotment planning 
suitable for use in establishing the fixed satellite service at the 
1988 Space World Administrative Radio Conference (ORB-88). The 
two phases are (1) the identification of predetermined geostationary 
arc segments common togroups of administrations, and (2) the 
use of a synthesis program to identify example scenarios of space 
station placements. The planning approach is described in detail 
and is related to the objectives of the confernece. Computer 
software has been developed to implement the concepts, and a 
complete discussion on the logic and rationale for identifying 
predetermined arc segments is given. Example scenarios are 
evaluated to give guidance in the selection of the technical 
characteristics of space communications systems to be planned. 
The allotment planning concept described guarantees in practice 
equitable access to the geostationary orbit, provides flexibility in 
implementation, and reduces the need for coordination among 
administrations. Author

The Space Station Program will be the most ambitious space 
project the nation has ever undertaken; will require tens of billions 
of dollars; and will entwine for many years the space program 
with those of international partners. It must have enduring stable 
support across administrations, and the support must be generous. 
The current Space Shuttle is barely adequate for the limited purpose 
of deploying the Space Station, and it is inadequate to meet broader 
national needs in space. The Committee recommends in the 
strongest terms that the Shuttle be upgraded with new improved 
solid rocket motors, that it be supplemented with expendable launch 
vehicles, and that a heavy lift launch vehicle be developed for 
use in the latter half of the 1990s. The Committee strongly 
recommends that NASA prepare a new Space Station Program 
cost estimate in conjunction with the Program Requirements Review 
scheduled for early next year by NASA. The exercise should 
address the full range of uncertainties in the current Program, 
some of which are discussed in the report. GRA

The purpose of this study is to define the requirements of 
commercially motivated microgravity combustion experiments and 
the optimal way for space station to accommodate these 
requirements. Representatives of commercial organizations, 
universities and government agencies were contacted. Interest in 
and needs for microgravity combustion studies are identified for 
commercial/industrial groups involved in fire safety with terrestrial 
applications, fire safety with space applications, propulsion and 
power, industrial burners, or pollution control. From these interests 
and needs experiments involving: (1) no flow with solid or liquid 
fuels; (2) homogeneous mixtures of fuel and air; (3) low flow with 
solid or liquid fuels; (4) low flow with gaseous fuel; (5) high pressure 
combustion; and (6) special burner systems are described and 
space station resource requirements for each type of experiment 
provided. Critical technologies involving the creation of a laboratory 
environment and methods for combining experimental needs into 
one experiment in order to obtain effective use of space station 
are discussed. Diagnostic techniques for monitoring combustion 
process parameters are identified. Author

Three broad goals were presented by NASA as a guide to 
meet the challenges of the future: to advance scientific knowledge 
of the planet Earth, the solar system, and the universe; to expand 
human presence beyond the Earth into the solar system; and to 
strengthen aeronautics research and technology. Near-term and 
new-generation space transportation and propulsion systems are 
being analyzed that will assure the nation access to and presence 
in space. Other key advanced studies include large astronomical 
observatories, space platforms, scientific and commercial payloads, 
and systems to enhance operations in Earth orbit. Longer-range 
studies include systems that would allow humans to explore the 
Moon and Mars during the next century. Research programs, both 
to support tha many space missions studied or managed by the 
Center and to advance scientific knowledge in selected areas, 
involve work in the areas of atmospheric science, earth science, 
space science (including astrophysics and solar, magnetospheric, 
and atomic physics), and low-gravity science. Programs and 
experiment design for flights on the Space Station, free-flying 
satellites, and the Space Shuttle are being planned. To maintain 
a leadership position in technology, continued advances in liquid 
and solid propellant engines, materials and processes; electronic, 
structural, and thermal investigations; and environmental control 
are required. Progress during the fiscal year 1987 is discussed,
