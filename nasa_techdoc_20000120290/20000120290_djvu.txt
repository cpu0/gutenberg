ABSTRACT 

A probabilistic approach is described for aeropropulsion 
system assessment. To demonstrate this approach, the technical 
performance of a wave rotor-enhanced gas turbine engine (i.e. 
engine net thrust, specific fuel consumption, and engine weight) is 
assessed. The assessment accounts for the uncertainties in 
component efficiencies/flows and mechanical design variables, 
using probability distributions. The results are presented in the 
form of cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) and sensitivity 
analyses, and are compared with those from the traditional 
deterministic approach. The comparison shows that the 
probabilistic approach provides a more realistic and systematic way 
to assess an aeropropulsion system. 

INTRODUCTION 

The need to provide cost-effective aeropropulsion technology 
is critical in today's environment. Since the beginning of the 1990s, 
civil and military organizations have been attempting to reduce 
costs like never before. Demands are strong for aircraft engines 
with reduced life-cycle costs, emphasizing durability for longer 
inter\'als between overhaul, high reliability for the lowest possible 
unscheduled maintenance, and improved maintainability for fast, 
simple maintenance. In response to such demands of their highly 
competitive marketplace, the engine manufacturers must focus on 
product reliability, maintainability, and most definitely 
affordability. At the same time they must reduce the product 
development cycle due to shrinking development budgets and 
resources. Rapid tum around time while investigating new design 
concepts or technologies is critical to be competitive within the 
aerospace industry. At the Propulsion System Analysis Office 
(PSAO) of N.ASA Glenn Research Center (GRC), our mission is to 
assess the performance potential and economic benefits of 
advanced and unconventional propulsion systems for a broad 
spectrum of subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic aeronautical 
vehicles. These assessments provide the basis for NASA's future 
aeropropulsion program directions and technology investment 
decisions. As the lead NASA Center in aeropropulsion, GRC's 
primary mission is aeropropulsion research and technology. The 
technology is transferred to the aviation industry to help maintain 
U.S. leadership in the world's aviation market. 

In view of the challenges facing the engine manufacturers 
today, it is obvious that critical decisions must be made in the early 
stages of engine development where available design freedom can 
best achieve better performance and cost is relatively low, as shown 
in Fig. 1 . As such, the role of system assessment, performed in the 
early stages of an engine development program, becomes very 
critical to the successful development of new aeropropulsion 
systems. A reliable system assessment not only helps to identify the 
best propulsion system concept amongst several candidates, it can 
also identify high payoff technologies worthy of pursuit to 
decision-makers. This is particularly important for advanced 



aeropropulsion technology development programs which require 
enormous amount of resources, such as the Pulse Detonation Engine 
(PDE) and Ultra Efficient Engine Technology (UEET) programs being 
investigated at GRC. 

In the current practice of deterministic or point-design approach, 
uncertainties of design variables are either unaccounted for or 
accounted for by the safety factors. This could often result in an 
assessment with unknown and unquantifiable reliability. Consequently, 
it fails to provide additional insight into the risks associated with new 
technologies, which are often needed by the decision-makers to 
determine the benefit and retum-on-investment of a new aircraft 
engine. In this paper, an alternative approach based on probabilistic 
method is described for a comprehensive assessment of aeropropulsion 
system. The statistical approach quantifies the design uncertainties 
inherent in a new aeropropulsion system and their influences on engine 
performance. It provides an analytical framework that allows an engine 
developer to improve engine performance by determining the 
necessary design margin, the parameters impacting the uncertainty in 
performance, and ways to reduce the impact of uncertainty. As such, it 
enhances the reliability of a system assessment. An assessment of a 
wave rotor-enhanced turbofan engine is performed to demonstrate the 
methodology. The assessment accounts for the uncertainties which 
occur in component efficiencies/flows, and mechanical design 
variables, using probability distributions. 

OBJECTIVE 

The objective of the current work is to demonstrate the application 
of probabilistic approach and its feasibility for aeropropulsion system 
assessment. 

NUMERICAL EXAMPLE FOR DEMONSTRATION 

A wave rotor-enhanced turbofan engine is chosen to demonstrate 
the probabilistic approach. Wave rotor is a device that utilizes unsteady 
wave to compress air in a single device. Enhancement of a gas turbine 
engine with a wave rotor can improve specific power and reduce 
specific fuel consumption. This engine was analyzed previously using 
the traditional deterministic approach, and the results are reported 
(Jones and Welch, 1996). The intent of the current work is not to 
challenge the previous results. Rather, it is to demonstrate the 
application and feasibility of probabilistic approach for aeropropulsion 
system assessment. 

Affordability and retum-on-investment of a new aeropropulsion 
system are strongly influenced by cost, specific fuel consumption, 
engine thrust and weight. This demonstration focuses on the technical 
aspect of engine performance, i.e., specific fuel consumption, engine 
thrust and weight. 

The current results are compared with those calculated previously 
using the deterministic approach (Jones and Welch, 1996). In addition.

the baseline engine used for the comparison with the wave rotor- 
enhanced engine (Jones and Welch, 1996) is also used for the 
current comparison. 

ANALYSIS APPROACH AND PROCEDURES 

The approach taken in this effort is to combine 
thermodynamic cycle analysis embedded in the computer code 
NEPP (NASA Engine Performance Program, Klann and Snyder, 
1994), engine weight analysis embedded in the computer code 
WATE (Onat and Klees, 1979), and fast probability integrator (FPI, 
Southwest Research Institute, 1995). A schematic of the integrated 
approach is shown in Fig. 2. 

The computer code NEPP is used to calculate engine net thrust 
and specific fuel consumption. It is a one-dimensional steady state 
thermodynamic cycle analysis code which allows the user to model 
virtually any kind of gas turbine engine cycle through the use of 
components which can be placed in any order to create the desired 
cycle. The engine weight is estimated by the WATE code. These 
analyses are performed at the sea-level static condition. The role of 
FPI is to perform probabilistic analysis utilizing the results 
generated by NEPP and WATE. The results are presented in the 
form of cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). In addition, FPI 
is used to perform sensitivity analysis to rank design variables in 
order of their impact on a specific response variable. The FPI code 
was developed under contract with NASA Glenn Research Center. 



Sensitivity values could be ± in nature. A positive value indicates 
that the response variable will decrease as the design variable increases 
and vice versa. Variable with the highest absolute sensitivity value is 
defined to be the most influential variable. Variable with the second 
highest absolute sensitivity value is second most influential variable 
and so on. This ranks the design variables in the order of their 
influences on the response variable. The sensitivity information thus 
obtained from FPI is verj' u.seful from the design point of view. For 
example, reliability in design can be improved when uncertainties in 
the most influential variables are reduced. Those design variables that 
do not have significant influences deterministically could nevertheless 
have strong influences on the response scatter if these design variables 
have large uncertainties. Weak design variable with large uncertainties 
may have probabilistic sensitivity factors more important than strong 
design variables with small uncertainties. Unlike deterministic analysis, 
sensitivity factors in probabilistic analysis are functions of both the 
deterministic sensitivity and the uncertainty (characterized by the 
standard deviation). 

The procedures for the probabilistic analysis are as follows: 

(1) Identify the basic design variables with uncertainties (i.e. 
identify the risk elements). 

(2) Quantify the uncertainties with probability distributions, based 
on expert opinion elicitation, historical data, or benchmark/ 
prototype testing, etc.

(3) Identify the response variables (SFC, thrust, weight, cost, 
etc.). 

(4) Establish functional relationships between the design 
variables and the response variables, with analytical 
expressions or numerical evaluation thru computer codes 
(e.g. NEPP, WATE). 

(5) Perform perturbation for the selected set of values (mean 
and standard deviation) of the design variables to generate 
response variables. For this work, NEPP and WATE are 
used to perturb specific fuel consumption (SFC), engine 
thrust and weight. 

(6) Perform probabilistic analysis to compute CDFs of the 
response variables. For this work, FPI is used to compute 
the CDFs and the corresponding sensitivities of the 
response variables and rank the design variables in the 
order of their influences. 

PROBABILISTIC SIMULATION 

There are a number of approaches available for obtaining 
probabilistic response for a given set of independent primitive 
variables. One approach that is commonly used is called Monte- 
Carlo simulation technique. While this approach provides almost 
exact solutions, it is fairly expensive and time-consuming 
approach. In this technique, randomly selected values of the input 
variables, which are based on their known probabilistic 
distributions, are used to deterministically compute the value of the 
response variable. This has to be repeated usually several hundreds 
or even thousands of times to build the response probabilistic 
characteristics. In essence, this technique requires a large number 
of simulations to generate CDF's of output variables. Although, 
inherently simple, the large number of computer runs required to 
obtain a reasonably accurate CDF of output variables becomes its 
obvious disadvantage. NASA-Glenn Research Center has been 

involved in developing efficient probabilistic methods for more 
than a decade. As a result of this research initiative, fast probability

integration (FPI) algorithms were developed (Southwest Research 
Institute, 1995) to solve a large class of engineering problems. 

Let us say that there are n random design variables in a problem 
and that we want to use probabilistic analysis to compute the 
probability of occurrence of a certain response function 



Z(X) = Z(Xi,X2,...X„) 



(1) 



where Z represents the response variable and X represents the random 
variable. Our aim is to compute the probability that Z will have a value 
less than or equal to a given magnitude Zq. To achieve this goal, the 

performance function, which describes how the mechanics of the 
system behaves, can be cast as a limit state function g(X), which can be 
described as 



^(A')=Z(X)-Zo 



(2) 



Traditionally, the limit state function g has been defined in such a 
way that g = represents a boundary where g < represents failed 
region and g>0 represents safe region. Here the objective would be to 
compute P[g(X) - 0]. Generally speaking, Zq describes a limit 

indicating failure; g(X) is called a failure function. 

Given the joint probability density function //.v) of the limit state 

function j(.v), we can formulate the limit state probability Pig - 0] as 



Pf = P[g{X)<0]=j...jf,ix)dx

a 



where CI describes the domain of integration. This multiple integration 
is, in general, very difficult to integrate analytically. However, FPI has 
been found to be an excellent tool to evaluate Eq. (3) efficiently and 
accurately.

DESIGN AND RESPONSE VARIABLES FOR THE 
NUMERICAL EXAMPLE 

The design variables are: 

fan efficiency 

low pressure compressor (LPC) efficiency 

high pressure compressor (HPC) efficiency 

wave rotor pressure ratio 

high pressure turbine (HPT) efficiency 

high pressure turbine (HPT) inlel temperature 

low pressure turbine (LPT) efficiency 

bleed flow 

turbine disk material strength 



The assumed mean values and standard deviations of these design 
variables are shown in Table I. These variables are assumed to be 
independent and have normal distributions, with the exception of the 
turbine disk material strength which has Weibull distribution. For 
many engineering problems, design variables with small variability 
have generally been seen to have normal distributions. Material 
strength is generally characterized with Weibull distributions. With 
upper and lower limits for these design variables based on ±2 standard 
deviations around the mean value for each design variable, 95.4 
percent of the expected uncertainty is captured.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

As mentioned earlier, it is critical to assess the reliability of a 
new aeropropulsion system because of inherent design 
uncertainties. The current demonstration focuses on the technical 
aspect of engine performance, i.e., specific fuel consumption, 
engine thrust and weight. The results are presented in the form of 
cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) and sensitivity analyses. 
A CDF gives a relationship between a value up to certain 
magnitude of a response variable and the probability of its 
occurrence. 



The results are summarized and compared with those based on the 
deterministic approach, in Table 2. 

In reference to the SFC obtained previously using the 
deterministic approach, 0.304 Ib/hr/lb (0.0310 kg^r/N), the current 
result shows that the cumulative probability for that to occur is only 
10 percent. In other words, the confidence level to achieve a SFC of 
0.304 Ib/hr/lb (0.0310 kg/hr/N) or better is only 10 percent. The 
probability is much higher to obtain a SFC of 0.320 Ib/hr/lb (0.0326 
kg/hr/N) or better, about 99 percent. This is shown in Fig. 3.

The sensitivity of SFC to the nine design variables, at 99% 
probability level, is shown in Fig. 4. It shows that the most 
influential design variable for SFC is high-pressure turbine (HPT) 
inlet temperature. It implies that to improve the SFC of this engine, 
the biggest payoff is to decrease the HPT inlet temperature and 
control its scatter (uncertainties). By reducing the scatter from 



100 R (56K) to 50 R (28 K), the SFC reduces from 0.320 Ib/hr/lb 
(0.0326 kg/hr/N) to 0.315 Ib/hr/lb (0.0321 kg/hr/N). This resuh is also 
shown in Fig. 5. In addition, the scatter range of the SFC is reduced by 
35 percent. This is indicated by the probability density function (PDF) 
shown in Fig. 6. The influences of HPT and LPT efficiencies are

moderate. Other design variables such as LPC and HPC

As expected, the turbine disk material strength has no influence on 
SFC. 

For the engine net thrust, the result shows that the probability

which was reported (Jones and Welch, 1996) based on the 
deterministic approach, is fairly good — about 60 percent ( 1 .0 to 0.4). 
This is shown in Fig. 7. Also, even with the current assumption of 
design uncertainties, it is very likely that the current engine will 
outperform the baseline engine in net thrust — about 90 percent 
probability. This is also shown in Fig. 7. The sensitivity results for

engine net thrust, at 99% probability level, is shown in Fig. 8. 
Again, the result shows that the most influential design variable for 
engine net thrust is HPT inlet temperature, and the turbine disk 
material strength has no impact. 

For the engine weight, the likelihood of obtaining an engine 
weight of 2 11 20 lbs (9580 kg) or less, calculated detemiinistically 
(Jones and Welch, 1996), is fairly good — about 66 percent. 
However, with the current assumption of design uncertainties it is 
very unlikely that the current engine will outperform the baseline 
engine in engine weight — only about 10 percent probability. These 
results are shown in Fig. 9. The sensitivity results for engine 
weight, at 99% probability level, is shown in Fig. 10. As expected, 
the result shows that the turbine disk material strength is the most 
influential design variable for the engine weight. The influences of 
HPT inlet temperature and HPC efficiency are moderate. The rest 
of the design variables have minimal influences on engine weight. 

Overall, the results show that component uncertainty can have 
a significant impact on engine performance. For the current 
example, the FTPT inlet temperature dominates the influence on 
SFC and engine thrust. Its impact on engine weight is more 
moderate. Turbine-disk material strength dominates the influence 
on engine weight. Decreasing the HPT inlet temperature will have 
favorable impact on SFC but unfavorable impact on engine thrust 
and weight, and vice versa. If SFC receives too much emphasis, 
engine thrust and weight suffer. However, increasing the turbine- 
disk material strength and/or component efficiencies can 
compensate the unfavorable impact on engine weight. Discovering 
these relationships is not peculiar to using probabilistic approach. 
Rather, probabilistic approach helps engine developers visualize 
and make trades of design margins. 

More over, the results show that the current integrated 
probabilistic approach (NEPP + WATE + FPI) not only calculates 
the SFC, engine thrust and weight, but also determines the 
probability of their occurrences. As such, the probabilistic 
assessment provides additional insight into the risks associated with 
new technologies, which makes it easier for the decision-makers to 
determine the benefit and retum-on-investment of a new 
aeropropulsion system. In addition, the approach ranks the relative 
importance of the design variables as to their influences on the 
engine performance, in the form of sensitivity factors. High 
sensitivity factor indicates an area to be focused for improving the 
engine performance and its reliability. 

The current work addresses the application of probabilistic 
approach to assess SFC, engine thrust and weight. Similarly, 



theapproach can also be used to assess the other aspects of 
aeropropulsion system performance, such as cost, acoustic noise, and 
emissions, etc. 

CONCLUSIONS 

Based on the comparison of the results between the probabilistic 
and deterministic approaches, the following conclusions are made: 

(1) The probabilistic approach provides a more realistic and 
systematic way to assess an aeropropulsion system, because it 
accounts for uncertainties in the design variables. 

(2) The results from probabilistic assessment are more credible 
and reliable, because it incorporates the 'past lessons learned' 
(i.e., expert opinions, historical data, etc.) to quantify the ri.sks. 
As a result, the likelihood of repeating past mistakes will be 
minimized. 

(3) The probabilistic approach allows the decision-makers to 
detect problems early before they become critical. As such, 
risks can be mitigated accordingly and resources (time, 
funding, etc.) can be used more wisely. 

(4) Probabilistic assessments provide decision makers with a tool 
that allows them to assign priorities to needed technological 
developments and thus increase the likelihood that R&D 
investments will have high payoffs. 

(5) The probabilistic assessment provides additional insight into 
the risks associated with new technologies, which makes it 
easier for the decision-makers to determine the benefit and 
retum-on-investment of a new aeropropulsion system.

13. ABSTRACT ('Maximum 200 words; 

A probabilistic approach is described for aeropropulsion system assessment. To demonstrate this approach, the technical 
performance of a wave rotor-enhanced gas turbine engine (i.e. engine net thrust, specific fuel consumption, and engine 
weight) is assessed. The assessment accounts for the uncertainties in component efficiencies/flows and mechanical 
design variables, using probability distributions. The results are presented in the form of cumulative distribution func- 
tions (CDFs) and sensitivity analyses, and are compared with those from the traditional deterministic approach. The 
comparison shows that the probabilistic approach provides a more realistic and systematic way to assess an 
aeropropulsion system.
