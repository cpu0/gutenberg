1 SCOPE 

1.1 Identification 

Version Description Document, 
PCTE Browser Tool (PBT), 
Version 1.0, 

SunOS Implementation 


1.2 System Overview 

The PCTE Browser Tool (PBT) is designed to graphically display parts of a PCTE object 
base. Selected graphs of objects in the object base and the relationships amongst these 
objects are displayed at the PBT user’s request. The PBT is intended to complement text- 
oriented commands such as obj-list-links and obj_list_attr that are included with the 
Emeraude PCTE V12 release—commands intended to be invoked from the text-oriented esh 
command shell. 


2 RELATED SOFTWARE 

The PBT is an instance of the Reusable Graphical Browser (RGB), a generic graphical 
browser for the display of networks of nodes and arcs. In the case of the PBT, the nodes 
displayed by the RGB are PCTE objects, and the arcs are PCTE links. PBT version 1.0 
was developed using RGB version 1.0. 

The PBT is an X Window System application requiring the installation of XI1, Release 
4 (X11R4). It is a Motif-oriented application making use of the SA-Motif Ada bindings, 
version 1.0, a commercial product of Systems Engineering Research Corporation (SERC). 

The PBT is ultimately intended for use in an ECMA PCTE environment and has been 
implemented using the ECMA-162 Ada programming bindings to PCTE. 'However, in the 
absence of a conforming ECMA PCTE implementation, the PBT has been built on top of 
the Emeraude V12 PCTE implementation, using the subset implementation of the ECMA 
Ada binding developed by Paramax STARS (version 0.2). 


3 VERSION DESCRIPTION 
3.1 Inventory of Contents 

The PBT distribution is structured as shown below. The top-level directory pbt includes 
PostScript (VDDpbt.ps) and clear ASCII text (VDDpbt.tty) versions of this document. It 
contains a complete directory listing of the PBT distribution (Contents.tty, reproduced 
herein as Appendix A). It also contains a PostScript version of the PBT user manual 


Page 1 





30 November 1992 


STARS- U C-05203/002/00 


(USERpbt.ps). It contains the DDL specification (pbt.sds) of the pbt SDS used by the 
browser. Finally, it contains the following subdirectories, described below: 

pbt/code 

pbt/bin 

pbt/X-Resources 

pbt/X-Resources/bitmaps 


3.1.1 Subdirectory: pbt/code 

This directory contains the Ada source code for the PBT. It also contains the C shell scripts 
and associated support files needed to rebuild the PBT. 


3.1.2 Subdirectory: pbt/bin 

This is the directory into which the build process moves the PBT executable after a successful 
compile and link. This directory contains two PBT executables named PBT12.2 and PBT12.3, 
which have been linked to execute under Emeraude V12.2 and V12.3, respectively. 


3.1.3 Subdirectory: pbt/X-Resources 

This directory contains the PCTE-Browser.black_n_white and PCTE-Browser.color files 
describing the X resource values used by the browser for black-and-white and color monitors, 
respectively. These values specify such characteristics of the PBT as the dimensions to be 
used for the various windows created by the browser. This directory also contains the 
bitmaps subdirectory, described below. 


3.1.3.1 Subdireftory: pbt/X-Resources/bitmaps 

This directory contains X bitmaps for the icons used by the PBT. These icons represent 
the different types of PCTE objects (e.g., File) and relationships (e.g., Composition and 
Reference links) recognized by the browser. 


3.2 Changes Installed 

3.2.1 Release 1.0 

3.2.1.1 General Changes 

• PBT terminology has been changed to be more consistent with PCTE terminology: 
Overall Views are now called Composite Views.

STA RS-UC-05203/002/00 


Files affected: 
callbacks_b. a 
static_menus_b. a 
utilities_b.a 

• Clarified the fact that the link name pattern matching refers to link type names. This 
clarification has been made both to the relevant popup menus and in the relevant user 
manual sections. 

Files affected: 
static_menus_b.a 
USERpbt.ps 

• In order to make the PBT output more consistent, PBT commands which display path¬ 
names have been modified to exclude SDS names when the PBT has been customized 
to exclude such names from View node and arc labels. 

Files affected: 
utilities_b.a 

• Changed the name of the X-Resources/PCTE-bitmaps directory to be called 
X-Resources/bitmaps. This was done to be consistent with Motif naming conven¬ 
tions for such subdirectories. 

Directories affected: 

X-Resources/PCTE-bitmaps 

• PCTE I/O oriented files used in the 0.1 release of the PBT have been moved into 
the 0.2 release of the STARS Ada/PCTE bindings, and have, therefore, been removed 
from this release. 

Files deleted: 

pcte.obj ect_create. a pcte.support. a 
pcte_support_b. a

3.2.1.2 Bug Fixes 


• Fixed bug that prevented the display of non-key link attributes for links without key 
attributes.

3.2.1.3 New Features 


Page 3 






30 November 1992 


STARS-UC-05203/002/00 


• The PBT now has a Motif-oriented look-and-feel, primarily because of the changes 
made in the 1.0 release of ihe RGB. (The RGB previously used the STARS Ada/Xt 
implementation, while now uses SERC’s commercial SA-Motif Ada bindings.) These 
changes includes the new use of control panels, rather than sequences of popup dialog 
boxes.

• The PBT now supports the invoking of arbitrary PCTE processes on behalf of PCTE 
objects. This new capability allows for specialized viewer programs to be invoked for 
specialized types of file objects. Previously, only the only way that a file object could 
be viewed was to display it in a text window—something that could only be done for 
pure ASCII text files. Now, for instance, a Software Through Picture (StP) diagram, 
stored in a PCTE file object, can be viewed from within the PBT using the appropriate 
StP diagram display utility.

3.3.3 Configuration-Unique Data 

There are two explicit dependencies in the PBT itself to UNIX, in its use of the “exit” 
procedure as part of the PBT termination processing, and is access to UNIX environment 
variables. These features are accessible via the Ada pragma INTERFACE capability in the 
code files utilitiesJb.a and system_env_b.a. 

The PBT makes extensive use of ECMA PCTE Ada bindings, which, in its current imple¬ 
mentation is highly dependent upon the Emeraude V12 PCTE implementation. 


3.4 Interface Compatibility 

The 1.0 release of the PBT supports all of the functionality of the previous PBT release 
(0.1). However, the commands and menus used to access many of these functions have been 
revised in the change to a Motif-oriented user interface. 


3.5 Installation Instructions 

The sections below describe the steps needed to: 

• build the PBT executable (optional—see the note at end of section 3.5.1) 

• install the PBT’s X Resource file, PCTE-Brovser 

• install the PBT executable in the environment 

• install the SDS (pbt) needed by the browser in the PCTE metabase 

(See the accompanying PBT user manual for details on how to use the browser.)

STARS-UC-05203/002/00 


3.5.1 Build Procedure 

This section describes the procedure for compiling and linking the PBT program using the 
Sun Ada 1.0 Ada compilation system from Sun Microsystems. 

The build process assumes the following. Before proceeding with the build of the PBT, first 
verify that these assumptions are correct. 


• The entire PBT delivery contents have previously been loaded onto the local file system. 
For purposes of these installation instructions, the top-level directory for the PBT 
delivery shall be referred to as /local/pbt. 

• SERC’s SA-Motif, version 1.0, has previously been installed onto the local file system, 
at a location to be referred to below as /local/serc.samotif. 

• The Reusable Graphical Browser, version 1.0, has previously been loaded onto the local 
file system, at a location to be referred to below as /local/rgb. 

• The RGB library has previously been built using the SunAda 1.0 Ada compiler. See the 
VDD for the RGB release for information on how to build this library. This library is 
assumed to be found in the following UNIX directory: /local/rgb/Build-SunAdal.0/rgb 

• The Emeraude PCTE implementation, version V12.3, has been loaded onto the local 
file system, at a location to be referred to below as /local/emeraude^pcte. 

• The PCTE Ada Bindings implementation version 0.2, has been loaded onto the local 
file system, at a location to be referred to below as /local/adapcte. 

• The PCTE PCTE Ada Bindings has previously been built using the SunAda 1.0 Ada 
compilation system. See the VDD for the Ada Bindings release for information on 
how to build this library. This library is assumed to be found in the following UNIX 
directory: /local/adapcte02/Build.SunAdal.0 

• The Xlib archive file corresponding to the X11R4 delivery has previously been created. 
Consult with your local system administrator for the exact location of the Xlib archive 
file on your system. For purposes of this discussion, it is assumed that this file can be 
found at: 

— /usr/lib/Xll/libXll.a 


To build the PBT, first edit the code/Build_PBT.var file to reflect the actual operating 
environment. This file (listed in its entirety in Appendix B.l) initializes the environment 
variables used by the rest of the build process. Variables that must be initialized include the 
following: 


• PBT - the top level directory of the PBT distribution 


Page 8 






30 November 1992 


STARS-UC-05203/002/00 


• RGB - the directory containing the RGB Ada library built using Sun Ada 1.0 

• LIBX - the pathname of the X11R4 Xlib archive 

• COMPILERPATH - the pathname of the top-level directory of the SunAda 1.0 compilation 
system 

• PCTE - the directory containing the SunAda library for the ECMA PCTE Ada bindings 
(Ada/PCTE) 

• PCTE-R00T - the top level directory of the PCTE delivery 


Once the code/BuildJ’BT.var file has been edited, the rest of the compiling and linking of 
the PBT is fully automated. Simply cd to the PBT distribution’s code directory and execute 
the code/Build_PBT.csh C shell script (shown in its entirety in Appendix B.2), as in the 
following example: 

'/. cd /local/pbt/ code 
7, Build_PBT.csh >& Build.out & 

This script creates the directory called Build_SunAdal .0 below the top-level PBT directory 
in which the PBT’s SunAda library will be created and in which the link will take place. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: This step is optional and can be skipped because (already compiled 
and linked) executables for Emeraude V12.2 and Emeraude V12.3 environment have been 
included in the release. To skip the build step, simply rename the appropriate executable 
from the bin directory, as in the following UNIX commands: 

mv /local/pbt/bin/?BT12 .2 /local/pbt/bin/PBT or 

mv //oca//p6f/bin/PBT12.3 /local/pbt/bin/PBT 

In this example, /local/pbt would be replaced by the actual full UNIX pathname of the 
appropriate site-specific directory. ' 


3.5.2 Executable Installation Procedure 

Assuming that the build is successful, the executable PBT will be moved into the bin direc¬ 
tory beneath the top-level PBT directory—replacing any version of PBT previously in that 
directory. 

The PBT executable could be installed as a static context within the PCTE object base prior 
to its first use. However, it can also be accessed from within PCTE by placing it in a UNIX 
directory that is part of the UNIX PATH environment variable. Therefore, it is assumed that 
the user will either include the PBT’s bin directory in the user’s path, or will copy the PBT 
executable to another directory already in the path (e.g., /usr/local/bin). 


Page 9 






30 November 1992 


STARS- UC-05203/002/00 


3.5.3 Installing the X Resource Files 

A number of UNIX files associated with the PBT must be on-line at the time that the PBT 
is executed: 

• A set of files describing the bitmaps to be used for the various node and link icons. 

• The “X resource file” associated with the PBT, PCTE-Browser, describing such infor¬ 
mation as which bitmap to use for which type of object, what dimensions to use for 
the various widgets used by the PBT, etc. 

In the case of the PCTE-Browser file, two different versions are supplied in the release: 


• PCTE-Browser .color - for use on color monitors 

• PCTE-Browser .black_n_white - for use on monochrome monitors 

Depending upon the kind of monitor being used, one of these two files should be linked under 
the name PCTE-Browser, as in: 

In PCTE-Browser.color PCTE-Browser 

It is also important to make sure that the bitmaps subdirectory is located in the same 
directory as is the PCTE-Browser file. If it is not installed in the same directory, then the 
PBT will not be able to locate and use the bitmap files found in this subdirectory when the 
browser is invoked. 


3.5.4 Installing the PBT-Oriented SDS 

Some of the new PBT features depend upon the presence of the pbt SDS. In order to 
install this SDS into the PCTE metabase, the DDL specification of this SDS must be com¬ 
piled. A file containing this DDL specification is included in this delivery, under the name 
/local/pbt/ pbt.sds. To compile this file, it is necessary to first log into PCTE and then 
execute the sds_compile command, as in: 

sds_compile /local/pbt /pbt. sds 

In this example, /local/pbt would be replaced by the actual full UNIX pathname of the 
appropriate site-specific directory. 


3.6 Potential Problems 


1 . 


When the Initial Browser window is used to create the first Composite or Local View, 
the PBT is designed to transform the Initial Browser window into the View window. 


Page 10 



30 November 1992 


STARS-UC-05203/002/00 


This transformation involves expanding the size of the window, after which the second 
(view-specific) menu bar is added, along with the graph of the new View at the bottom 
of the window. However, occasionally, the window will be expanded in size, but the 
second menu bar and the graph will not be displayed. If and when this happens, simply 
use the window manager to resize the window: Even a very small change in window 
size—as small as one pixel—will cause the View window to be displayed properly. 

2. The PCTE-Browser is required to be in the directory identified by the XAPPLRESDIR 
environment variable. If it is not found in this directory, or if the XAPPLRESDIR 
variable is not properly set, then the PBT will terminate at the first attempt to create 
a Composite or Local View window, with the following error message: 

Error in kernel:: except i on .handler: below bottom of user stack 

3. If the bitmaps subdirectory is not found in the directory identified by XAPPLRESDIR, 
then the browser will not be able to display the proper node and link icons in View 
windows. 

4. The PBT will occasionally crash when deleting a View window if a number of View 
windows windows had previously been deleted. 

5. Warning messages will occasionally be written to the PBT’s standard output device 
when selected windows (primarily control panels) are closed down. These warning 
messages are harmless and can all be ignored. The following are examples of such 
warnings: 

Warning: XtRemoveGrab asked to remove a widget not on the list 
Warning: Attempt to remove non-existant passive grab 

3.7 Enhancements 

Possible future enhancements to the PBT include: 


• Addition of a PCTE object base editing capability. 

• Addition of a graphical SDS display and editing capability. 

• Improved graph layout algorithms. 

• Migration to a conforming ECMA PCTE environment. 


4 USER FEEDBACK 

We encourage experimentation with the PBT, and we solicit feedback from the PCTE com¬ 
munity to assist us in improving the product. Thus, we would greatly appreciate your 
comments, suggestions, and criticisms.
