POSIX Usage 


OSAT 



• Messagequajes for communication between 
interrupt service routines and rate group tasks 

• Semaphores i n bus controi ier services to protect 
simuitaneous access of scheduied i/0 chain iinked 
iist 

• Ti mers and synchronous reai-ti me signais i n tasks to 
perform scheduiing of i/ O 

• Retained VxWorks nativespecificcaiis 

• T aski ng 

• Interrupts 

• System set-up 




POSIX Lessons Learned 


OSAT 



• Execution times of POSIX and VxWorks features are 
similar 

• POSIX features were easy to employ and intermingle 
with native features within VxWorks 

• VxWorks POSIX is not complete; it doesn't support 
POSIX threads 

• For future projects, recommend that POSIX options be 
used wherever possible 

• utilize any individual native OS cal Is where needed for 
additional functionality or increased efficiency. 




OSAT 



D at a Fusion Integrity Process 


• Wright Lab's/ TASC DFIP algorithm provides 
detection, limiting and recovery from intermittent 
data errors 

• Ada95 DFIP filter was applied to four Ballistics input 
data channels and the Weapon Range output 

• Filter can beused tostabilizeCCIP solution 

• Typical results when applied to Weapon Range 
output, given input data drop-outs: 
























DFIP Evaluation 


OSAT 



• Performance was tested in AV-8B Flight Simulator 

• Short-duration (induced) data drop-outs were managed 

• Longer-term drop-outs and highly dynamicvalid data 
would requireacompromisedesign 

• M atri X sty I e f i I ters are expensi ve w i th respect to memory 
and executi on ti me 

- Execution time for fivechannels was approximately 1 
MSec 

• Current algorithm requires further refinement to add 
val ue to Boei ng's bal I istics appi ications 

• Short-term drop-outs not seen in simulators, rarely in flight 

• Other protection methods are already in place in fleet OFPs

Risk Reduction for 
Current/Future 
Programs 


• Re-engineered F-15 Runge-Kutta Ballistics Algorithm (BA) from 
AdaSBto Object Oriented Ada95 

• Employed Rational Rose design tool and 00 methodology 

• H igher performance processor allowed improvements to the accuracy 
of the Ballistics solution over AV-8B 

• Position differential equation solved 

• Velocity differential equation solved 

• Throughput availableto run 30 steps rather than 10, 3D rather 
than 2D 

• Trajectory completed in one frame at 20 Hz 

• Step size picked every trajectory step 

• Last step adjusted to complete trajectory at target elevation 




















A da95 Feature U sage 


OSAT 



• Tagged types - i ncl ud i ng extensi on of tagged type 

• Abstract types and functions 

• Aliased types 

• Access-to-constanttypes 

• Reused Iegacy Ada83 generics for vector operators 





Ada 95 Annex FeatureUsage 


OSAT 



• Annex A - Predefined Language Environment 
(Numerics) 

• package A da.N umerics.Long_Elementary_Functions 

• A nnex B -1 nterfaces to Other Languages 

• pragma I mport and Export 

• package I nterfaces.C 

• A nnex C - Systems Programmi ng 

• pragma Preelaborate 

• Machine Code Insert! on - used in Timing builds only 

• Ada not the Main Program 

• A da95 components were cal led from a C-H-main program 




00/A da95 Evaluation 


OSAT 



• Encountered very smooth language transition for 
experienced Ada83engineers 

• N ew object oriented features are a natural extension to the 
language 

• Learning 00 design methodology can bedifficult, 
especially for structured top-down programmers 

• Good trai ni ng leads to success - Designers attended 
AJ PO's Transitioning to A da95 course (Ada95 for 
Ada83 Programmers & Embedded / Real-Time 
Programming) 




OSAT 


00/A da95 Evaluation - Continued 

• Features for mixed language support were easy to 

implement 

• Interfacing to C software was simple with the new Ada95 
features 

• I nterfaci ng to C-H-was more difficult si nee C-H-is not 
standardized, and so no package I nterfaces.Cpp exists yet. 

• Ada95 is very portable 

• OSAT OFF Ada95 components were run on Sun 
Workstation (Rational), PC/ Pentium Workstation (Object 
Ada), Motorola PowerPC Card (Green Hills), DY-4PowerPC 
Card, and theCDIntMC PowerPC Card 

• Conversion of A da83 software to use Ada95 compiler 
(without re-engineering) was relatively simple 

• Changes were isolated to low-level design areas such as 
processor-dependent data formats 




Conclusions 


OSAT 



OSAT demonstrated Ada95and 00 methodology in a flight- 
worthy avionics application 

The demonstration included an application of POSIX with a 
COTS real-ti me operati ng systems 

Multi-language OFP components were combi ned and reused, 
demonstrating the capability of COTS tools, 00 architecture 
and wrappers (adapters) 

The DFIP Algorithm was implemented and evaluated in a flight¬ 
worthy application 

A commercial processor and board support package was flown 
in an avionics Mission Computer 

The performance of the prototype M C and software i n fl i ght test 
was equivalent to AV-8B fleet performance
