14. ABSTRACT 

The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Multimodal Signatures Database (MMSDB) is a centralized collection of sensor data of various 
modalities that are co-located and co-registered. The signatures include ground and air vehicles, personnel, mortar, artillery, small arms 
gunfire from potential sniper weapons, explosives, and many other high value targets. This data is made available to Department of Defense 
(DoD) and DoD contractors, Intel Agencies, other government agencies (OGA) and academia for use in developing target detection, tracking, 
and classification algorithms and systems to protect our Soldiers. A platform independent Web interface disseminates the signatures to 
researchers and engineers within the scientific community. Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) signature models provide an excellent solution 
for the sharing of complex multimodal signature data for algorithmic development and database requirements. Many open source tools for 
viewing and plotting HDF5 signatures are available over the Web. Future development includes extending the Web interface into a portal 
system for accessing ARL algorithms and signatures and High Performance Computing (HPC) resources.

This report is dedicated to our colleague, V. Anh Nguyen. Every time we walk into the Acoustic 
Library and see Anh’s plaque hanging on the wall, we pause and think about the early 
contributions Anh made to our database program. Although many of us never worked with her 
directly, a few have had the privilege of reading her unpublished notes she left behind on the 
acoustic database. She was truly a gifted researcher and it is an honor to take the database effort 
she started and to turn it into a major program within the Signal Image Processing (SIP) division. 
This report is dedicated to her memory.

1. Introduction 


The sharing and distributing of signature data and algorithms enhances and promotes the quality 
and depth of research and development within the scientific community. A long-standing 
obstacle in sharing data with different organizations is the variety of proprietary data formats 
used by organizations or the subgroups within them. Aside from the data formats, other 
difficulties encountered with data sharing are due to software tools that are technically difficult 
to install on remote computers and may involve license agreement issues in the distribution 
process of the software. Additional issues include incompatibility between client and server 
platforms (operating systems and application software) as well as configurations and components 
such as the Web server and database management software and applications. 

A solution to the true sharing and accessibility of scientific multimodal signature data is to 
develop a software system that is platform and Internet browser independent and will provide the 
data in a format common to researchers and engineers within the scientific community. Java, an 
open source fully object-oriented software language, provides excellent platform independence, 
ft also provides integration with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) to create an interactive 
and dynamic online experience for interfacing with databases and creating portals for accessing 
algorithms on computational engine servers. Java servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSPs) combine 
to provide Web access to online database signatures and algorithms with server side processing 
that does not require special software components installed on a client machine. Access to the 
Internet and a Web browser is the only requirement. 

In addition to a platform independent Web infrastructure that provides true accessibility of 
information over the Internet, a versatile and portable data model and file format is necessary to 
provide true sharing of multimodal signature data and ancillary signature information among 
various organizations. The file format must be open source and capable of accommodating large 
signature files along with metadata (ground truth, meteorological information, sensor parameters, 
etc.). An excellent choice is Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5). HDF5 provides all of the 
features necessary to support our signature database and algorithmic development requirements. 

This report details an overview for providing a true sharing and accessibility of ARL’s 
multimodal signatures and ancillary information, a Java Web interface, and general description 
of the multimodal signatures database (MMSDB) and design, ft is not intended to be a detailed 
users manual of the Web interface or a comprehensive design document detailing the design of 
the multimodal signatures database.

2. Background 


In the late 1990’s, the U.S. Army Researeh Laboratory (ARL) embarked on the development of a 
multiuser client/server interface with an acoustic database based on client-side processing 
running on the ARL local area network (LAN) (1). The system developed was limited in 
network accessibility across wide area networks (WAN) as well as platform independence. The 
LAN client/server interface approach was intended for demonstration purposes rather than actual 
deployment. The method of creating a Structured Query Language (SQL), based on targets, 
sensors, data collections, and meteorological conditions through a modular graphical user 
interface, proved to be an excellent intuitive method of interfacing the database with the end 
user. The following points describe the limitations of the initial client/server interface and 
database design. 

a. Database strictly designed for acoustic and seismic modalities with little flexibility to 
expand to other modalities. 

b. User interface strictly designed as a LAN application. 

c. Interface designed for client-side processing and running on a Windows only operating 
system (OS), which severely limits platform independence. 

d. Installation and/or updates to the client software required either downloading an installation 
file over the network or receiving the installation file on a computer disc (CD or DVD, etc.) 
or other portable storage media. 

e. System administration (SA) rights required to install client software. 

f User interface developed using proprietary ActiveX components, which hindered 
distribution due to license agreements and run-time license software to use such 
components. 

g. Proprietary binary format of signature files made sharing of the signatures difficult. 

h. Multiple files required as ancillary information to support signatures, which hindered the 
sharing of information. 

i. Proprietary computational environments, such as MATLAB, required for algorithmic 
development within the user interface. 

j. Client/server interface does not and cannot support High Performance Computing (HPC) 
and the use of such resources over the Internet. 

The new Web interface and multimodal database overcome the limitations of earlier work in this 
area.

3. System Architecture Overview 


The database eonsists of multimodal signature data files in the HDF5 format. Generally, eaeh 
signature file eontains all the ancillary information associated with the target signature. 

Ancillary information consists of target and event information; data collection including site 
information and date; sensor array information; ground truth information; sensor survey 
information; and meteorological information. Depending on the level of dissemination, ancillary 
information is modified (removed or added) to meet the appropriate dissemination level. There 
are four planned levels of online dissemination of the ARL multimodal signature database: 
online public release/unlimited distribution; Department of Defense (DoD) and DoD contractors 
only distribution on the Defense Research Engineering Network (DREN); Secret Internet 
Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) for disseminating up to and including classified SECRET 
signature information; and Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) for 
classified top secret dissemination. 

Signatures are stored on large database server hard drives with additional storage provided by 
directly attached storage arrays. Metadata regarding each signature is stored in the multimodal 
database tables that reside on the database server’s primary internal hard drive. The metadata is 
only accessible through the Web interface for general users by performing a database query. The 
database is accessible to the database administrator (DBA) though software tools to perform 
updates and other modifications. Remote access directly to the database through the Web will be 
implemented in the near future though a special Web interface for database administration only 
by the DBA. 

Users from client computers on the Internet communicate to the Web server through a Java 
developed Web interface to obtain access to the online multimodal database signatures. A 3-tier 
system separates the database, application, and the presentation tier. All the technologies that are 
used to develop the Web application and database management system use open source industry 
standards such as Apache, Tomcat, Linux, and MySQL. The Web interface uses Java 
technology including Java servlets and JSPs. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) provides encryption for 
secure communication over the Web. Eigure 1 shows the overall architecture of the Web 
application and multimodal database system (2).

Figure 1. ARL Multimodal signatures database architecture. 


The server software developed for both the application and database tier provides platform 
independence for the server and the client. The multimodal signatures database architecture uses 
either open source or proprietary operating systems and software. The present primary platform 
is Apache/Tomcat for the Web and application server running on either a Linux or a Mac OS X 
Server. Using both open source and proprietary relational database management systems, 
including the latest versions of Oracle and MySQL, the system was successfully tested. 

The client software is extremely platform independent. By using server side processing 
combined with a Web interface utilizing Java technology, the new interface creates an extremely 
platform independent environment for client access to the MMSDB. Unlike the initial platform 
dependent client/server interface developed in the late 1990’s, which was only usable on a client 
machine running a Microsoft Windows operating system, the new Web-based interface has only 
two requirements: access to the Internet and a Web browser of reasonably recent vintage. 

Table 1 shows various operating systems and browsers accessing the Web interface. The results 
demonstrate that many browsers running on many different operating systems, including old 
browsers (10 plus years old), are able to access successfully the Web interface and MMSDB.

4. Multimodal Signatures Database 


Aside from moving away from client-side processing and platform dependence, another 
requirement is to design and develop a relational database that is capable of handling signature 
modalities of extreme disparity and bring together all database signature libraries within a single 
system. A limitation of the initial acoustic database was its inability to handle properly the 
metadata generated by other signature phenomenology. Without extreme modification to the 
interface, a necessary design feature of the new multimodal database is expandability and 
flexibility. 

The new database design allows for easy expandability of metadata within the database tables, as 
well as a large amount of flexibility for the addition of database tables and changing of table key 
constraints. Other methodologies used in the design of the new database are minimizing 
metadata redundancy and maximizing referential integrity. In many ways, the new database is a 
collection of “living entities,” where the entities can easily change to meet the needs of the 
multimodal signatures database requirements. 

Various database design tools by Datanamic (Database DeZign and ImportER) created the 
entities, domains, relationships, generated SQL scripts for a vendor specific format such as 
Oracle or MySQL, and created a graphical data model of the database. Specially designed SQL 
scripts loaded the multimodal signature database tables with metadata corresponding to the 
HDL5 multimodal signatures. The most important aspect of the new multimodal database design 
is that the database tables model and correspond to actual “real world” signature phenomenology 
as shown in the entity diagram of the multimodal signatures database in figure 2.

5. Web Interface 


The design of the Web interface to query and retrieve multimodal signatures over the Web 
provides data encryption with an easy to use graphical user interface (GUI). The interface allows 
the user to query the database and download the signature file to their local computer. Future 
implementations will include a portal to a computational engine (such as MATLAB) to run 
various signal and image processing algorithms using the various signatures in the MMSDB and 
return the results to the end user. 

The online dissemination plan consists of four distinct dissemination levels each consisting of a 
Web interface, database, and HDF5 signature files that reflect the appropriate online 
dissemination level. Public release/unlimited distribution provides very little detailed 
information. The next level of online dissemination, DoD and DoD contractors only distribution 
on the DREN, will include the information at the public release/unlimited distribution level in 
addition to the detailed information permitted at the DoD and DoD contractors only level. A 
classified Web interface, database, and HDF5 signatures operating on the SIPRNET and JWICS 
will disseminate classified signatures. 

The public release/unlimited distribution level of dissemination through a Web interface is 
presently up and running at Eos Alamos National Laboratory (LANE), NM. The web site 
(https://infrsra.lanl.gov/ARLDB) is accessible to anyone and only contains information in the 
database, Web interface, and signature fdes that is releasable to the public. 

The Web interface consists of static (HTML) and dynamic (JSP) Web pages as shown in figures 
3 through 5. The Web browser displays an introductory Web page on the user’s computer screen 
when the Web site is entered (figure 3). The user clicks on the “Search and Download Existing 
Data” link to generate a dynamic Web page for building a sophisticated query to search the 
database as shown in figure 4. The user then chooses either a single selection or multiple 
selections for a given searchable parameter. After choosing the desired selections, the user clicks 
the “Search” button to submit the query to the database engine (MySQL) to search the MMSDB 
for the desired signatures. The results return in the form of a dynamic Web page (JSP) as shown 
in figure 5. The HDF5 signatures are downloaded, one at a time, to the user’s computer by right 
clicking on the file ID associated with a given signature file and choosing “Save Target As”. 
After the dialog box appears (figure 6), clicking the “Save” button will download the signature 
file to the user's computer. Upon successful completion of the download operation, another 
dialog box will appear as shown in figure 7. Section 6 will present various options for viewing 
and working with the HDF5 signatures.

The Web interface uses JSP for the presentation view of the Web application and Java servlets 
for the business logic behind the Web application. JSP allows the creation of dynamic Web 
pages that combine the static elements of HTML and dynamic elements of Java to access Java 2 
Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) services and application program interfaces (API) such as 
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). Using Java and JDBC, custom designed database classes 
allow direct access to the database directly through the JSP. Java servlets provide session 
management and tracking of users. The combined use of Java servlets and JSPs provide 
scalability and portability across many platforms (5). The design allows the software to work 
with many operating systems, Web and application servers, and database servers.

6. HDF5 Database Signature 


HDF5 is an object-oriented, open source, general-purpose, machine-independent, binary format 
developed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and is designed for 
storing large amounts of signature data of various modalities and complexity. NASA has used 
the file format for over 15 years to manage large amounts of imaging data {4). A single HDF5 
multimodal signature file is capable of storing all the signature modalities and ancillary 
information into a single file, although consideration of the file size with respect to downloading 
times over the Web is necessary. Various signature models allow a given signature to meet the 
dissemination requirements for a given level of online dissemination. Many open source, 
platform independent, powerful viewing and plotting tools (HDFView and HDF Explorer) are 
available over the Web. These tools are easy to download and install on your computer and 
provide easy to use GUIs for easy viewing of the signature and ancillary information. The HDF 
group Web site ( http://www.hdfgroup.org) allows open source downloading of several tools. 
MATLAB 7.x fully supports HDF5 files with several functions to create, write, and read HDF5 
files. Seamless integration of HDF5 signatures into the MATLAB environment allows 
algorithmic developers and researchers the ability to use the data immediately after downloading 
the signature files. 

The file format has many powerful features that make it the perfect solution for the 
dissemination of multimodal signature data. These features are: 

a. Supports large, complex scientific and engineering data sets with both lossless and lossy 
compression capability and encryption, error detection, and user-definable filters {4). 

b. Provides organization of data for efficient storage {4). 

c. Provides parallel I/O, including Message Passing Interface (MPI) I/O for parallel 
environments, and remote access {4). 

d. Provides the ability to store multimodal signature data including metadata. 

e. Future standard file format (64-bit) for MATLAB, replacing the present MATLAB 32-bit 
binary file format (known as mat file) (5). 

f Seamlessly integrates with many development languages such as MATLAB, Python, Java, 
C/C++, and LORTRAN with full open source library support. 

The HDL group Web site is an excellent source for additional information on HDP5. 

Especially developed MATLAB codes create HDL5 signatures from existing database libraries 
and legacy databases (6). The MATLAB codes create different HDL5 signatures depending on 
the level of dissemination. Over 800 HDL5 signatures, including ground and air platform 
acoustic array data of small arms, mortar, artillery fire, C4 explosives, and multimodal signatures 


13 




of equipment related to human infrastrueture, are presently available on the public 
release/unlimited dissemination Web site. 


HDFView is an open source viewing and simple plotting tool developed for many different 
platforms including Windows, LfNUX, and UNIX from the HDF group Web site. The GUI, as 
shown in figure 8, displays the entire contents (signature and ancillary information) of the HDF5 
signature. Figure 9 demonstrates the plotting capability of the HDFView tool. 



Figure 8. Visualization of a F1DF5 multimodal signature using the FlDFView tool.

HDF Explorer is another open souree, data visualization tool that available from the Spaee 
Researeh Software Web site (http;//www.space-research.org/) for Windows only platforms. It is 
an excellent tool for visualizing the information inside a HDF5 multimodal signature, 
particularly imaging modalities. 

HDF5 is a very flexible file format that will greatly aid the process of sharing signatures with 
ARE customers as well as supporting our internal research efforts within ARE.

7. Web Portal to a Computational Engine and HPC Resources 


The Internet is a wonderful networking infrastrueture to share database signature information. 
However, the concept of extending the Web interface into a portal system to share algorithms 
through a rich online interaction with a Web interface to a computational engine is very 
intriguing. Users would be able to access ARL algorithms with our data sets on a variety of 
computational engines, such as a MATLAB computational engine (2), and access to high 
performance computing resources would also be possible. 

ARL is developing a next generation Web interface for access to a computational engine, such as 
MATLAB. The advanced interface is based on earlier efforts by Ohio State University (2) under 
the User Productivity Enhancement and Technology (PET) program and the DoD High 
Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) in support of ARL. The new 
interface will provide unequalled access to a centralized collection of sensor data of various 
modalities that are co-located and co-registered through dynamic Web pages designed 
specifically for research and development. 


Conclusions 


The multimodal signatures database is an integral part of the mission performed by ARL, SEDD 
and the SIP division in the development of target detection, tracking, and classification 
algorithms and systems. The multimodal signatures database, future computational engine, and 
algorithmic development environment over the Web will greatly enhance the development of 
algorithms for detection, tracking, localization, and classification, and vastly improve 
Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) in the battlefield through improved system 
performance. By leveraging the best open source software and Web technologies available, 
ARL has created a multimodal signatures database that is fully accessible over the Web. The 
database provides unparalleled interoperability, security, and sharing of our signature data with 
our customers, including U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command 
(RDECOM), other DoD agencies, intelligence communities, and the National Signatures 
Program (NSP). 

ARL is leading the way in providing scientific visualization; internet access to scientific data; 
computational and algorithmic development environments and Web portals; innovative software 
and database design and methodologies; unique integration of algorithms, databases, and 
analytical tools; and leveraging open source software and database technologies and designs.
