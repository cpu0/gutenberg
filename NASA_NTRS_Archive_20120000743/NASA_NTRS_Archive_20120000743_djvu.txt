as affine invariant parameter space 
(AIPS), the technique can be applied to 
many image-processing and computer-vi- 
sion problems, including image registra- 
tion, template matching, and object 
tracking from image sequence. 

The AIPS is formed by the parameters 
in an affine combination of a set of fea- 
ture points in the image plane. In cases 
where the entire image can be assumed 
to have undergone a single affine trans- 
formation, the new AIPS match metric 
and matching framework becomes very 
effective (compared with the state-of- 
the-art methods at the time of this re- 
porting) . No knowledge about scaling or 
any other transformation parameters 
need to be known a priori to apply the 
AIPS framework. 

An automated suite of software tools 
has been created to provide accurate 
image segmentation (for data cleaning) 
and high-quality 2D image and 3D sur- 
face registration (for fusing multi-resolu- 
tion terrain, image, and map data). 
These tools are capable of supporting ex- 
isting GIS toolkits already in the market- 
place, and will also be usable in a stand- 
alone fashion. The toolkit applies novel 
algorithmic approaches for image seg- 
mentation, feature extraction, and regis- 
tration of 2D imagery and 3D surface 
data, which supports first-pass, batched, 
fully automatic feature extraction (for 
segmentation), and registration. 

A hierarchical and adaptive approach 
is taken for achieving automatic feature 
extraction, segmentation, and registra- 
tion. Surface registration is the process of 
aligning two (or more) data sets to a com- 
mon coordinate system, during which the 
transformation between their different 
coordinate systems is determined. 

Also developed here are a novel, volu- 
metric surface modeling and compres- 
sion technique that provide both quality- 
guaranteed mesh surface 

approximations and compaction of the 
model sizes by efficiently coding the 
geometry and connectivity/ topology 
components of the generated models. 
The highly efficient triangular mesh 
compression compacts the connectivity 
information at the rate of 1.5-4 bits per 


vertex (on average for triangle meshes) , 
while reducing the 3D geometry by 
40-50 percent. 

Finally, taking into consideration the 
characteristics of 3D terrain data, and 
using the innovative, regularized binary 
decomposition mesh modeling, a multi- 
stage, pattern-drive modeling, and com- 
pression technique has been developed 
to provide an effective framework for 
compressing digital elevation model 
(DEM) surfaces, high-resolution aerial 
imagery, and other types of NASA data.

Image Calibration 

Calibrate_lmage calibrates images ob- 
tained from focal plane arrays so that 
the output image more accurately repre- 
sents the observed scene. The function 
takes as input a degraded image along 
with a flat field image and a dark frame 
image produced by the focal plane array 
and outputs a corrected image. The 
three most prominent sources of image 
degradation are corrected for: dark cur- 
rent accumulation, gain non-uniformity 
across the focal plane array, and hot 
and/or dead pixels in the array. In the 
corrected output image the dark current 
is subtracted, the gain variation is equal- 
ized, and values for hot and dead pixels 
are estimated, using bicubic interpola- 
tion techniques.

@1 Rapid ISS Power 
Availability Simulator 

The ISS (International Space Sta- 
tion) Power Resource Officers (PROs) 
needed a tool to automate the calcula- 
tion of thousands of ISS power avail- 
ability simulations used to generate 
power constraint matrices. Each matrix 
contains 864 cells, and each cell repre- 
sents a single power simulation that 
must be run. The tools available to the 
flight controllers were very operator in- 
tensive and not conducive to rapidly 
running the thousands of simulations 
necessary to generate the power con- 
straint data. 

SOLAR is a Java-based tool that 
leverages commercial-off-the-shelf soft- 
ware (Satellite Toolkit) and an existing 
in-house ISS EPS model (SPEED) to 
rapidly perform thousands of power 
availability simulations. SOLAR has a 
very modular architecture and consists 
of a series of plug-ins that are loosely 
coupled. The modular architecture of 
the software allows for the easy re- 
placement of the ISS power system 
model simulator, re-use of the Satellite 
Toolkit integration code, and separa- 
tion of the user interface from the 
core logic. 

Satellite Toolkit (STK) is used to gen- 
erate ISS eclipse and insulation times, 
solar beta angle, position of the solar ar- 
rays over time, and the amount of shad- 
owing on the solar arrays, which is then 
provided to SPEED to calculate power 
generation forecasts. 

The power planning turn-around 
time is reduced from three months to 
two weeks (83-percent decrease) using 
SOLAR, and the amount of PRO power 
planning support effort is reduced by an 
estimated 30 percent.
