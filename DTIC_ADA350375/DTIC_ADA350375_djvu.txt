INTRODUCTION 


This document describes a revision of the Navy’s Long-Wavelength Propagation Capability 
(LWPC) developed by the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego. Ferguson and 
Snyder (1989a,b; 1990) and Ferguson (1990; 1993) documented previous versions of this capability. 
This document describes a revision of the LWPC, designated version 2.0 (LWPC-2.0), that includes 
improvements to the graphics routines, increased flexibility in specification of alternative iono¬ 
spheric models, and an option to execute a full-wave mode-conversion model for the signal-strength 
calculations. This version is principally composed of FORTRAN subroutines with a few additional 
routines written in C to implement the graphics capabilities under the Windows 95/NT operating 
systems. The LWPC is a collection of separate programs that perform unique actions. For example, 
the program that implements the propagation model and associated calculations is named the Long- 
Wave Propagation Model (LWPM), and the program that generates geographical displays of the 
signal strength is named GRDPLOT. These individual programs are described below. 

The LWPC is typically used to generate geographical maps of signal availability for coverage 
analysis. The program makes it easy to set up these displays by automating most of the required 
steps. The user specifies the transmitter location and frequency, the orientation of the transmitting 
and receiving antennae, and the boundaries of the operating area. The program automatically selects 
paths along geographic bearing angles to ensure that the operating area is fully covered. The diurnal 
conditions and other relevant geophysical parameters are then determined along each path. After the 
mode parameters along each path are determined, the signal strength along each path is computed. 
The signal strength along the paths is then interpolated onto a grid overlying the operating area. The 
final grid of signal strength values is used to display the signal-strength in a geographic display. 

The LWPC uses character strings to control programs and to specify options. The control strings 
have the same meaning and use among all the programs. On input, most control strings may be 
abbreviated. For example, the string TX-DATA can be entered in upper or lower case and can be 
shortened to TX-D. If a control string is shortened too much, it will not be recognized and execution 
will stop. To make it easier to read control strings composed of more than one word, dashes or 
underscores are used to connect the separate words, as in the above example. A blank in the first col¬ 
umn of a line of data causes the string to be treated as a comment line, allowing the user to annotate 
run streams for documentation and to provide prompts for editing. This feature also makes it con¬ 
venient to switch various program options on and off. 

This document is primarily a description of a computer program. It is difficult to distinguish the 
names of programs, variables, file names, etc., from each other. In this document, such difficulties 
are compounded by the use of control strings that are strings of characters used to organize the many 
different kinds of input to the program and to direct the order and types of calculations to be per¬ 
formed. Furthermore, some of the input parameters represent strings of characters while others 
represent numerical values. The following conventions will be used in this document:

SUMMARY OF MODIFICATIONS 

New control string handlers have been written that allow parameter lists for control strings to be 
truncated. New graphics routines were written to enhance the graphical interface and to use operating- 
system printer drivers. A new graphics initialization file was added to enable user-specified color and 
fill schemes. Filled contour plotting was implemented. The option of exporting the graphical output 
to PowerPoint was added. High-resolution maps of landmasses and coastal outlines were developed. 
Orthographic and stereographic map displays were added. The variability of the signal as stored in 
the “GRD” files was modified to use separate values for day, night, and transition. The handling of 
atmospheric noise statistics was modified to include the noise variability parameters, Du and Ou, 
making the coverage predictions consistent with CCIR (1963) recommendations. Two models of 
receiver performance with respect to atmospheric noise were added. These changes also make the 
predictions more conservative. An option for user-specified path segmentation was added. 


PROPAGATION MODEL 

The propagation model implemented in the LWPC treats the space between the earth’s surface 
and the lower ionosphere as a waveguide. The upper boundary of this waveguide is the earth’s iono¬ 
sphere that is characterized by a conductivity that may be specified by the user. A number of possible 
specifications of the ionosphere are provided in the LWPM ranging from a simple, horizontally 
homogeneous exponential conductivity profile to complicated spatially varying distributions of 
electron and charged-ion densities. It should be noted that many of the parameters that describe the 
boundaries of the earth-ionosphere waveguide are not known with great accuracy over all regions 
and times. 

The default model of the ionosphere used in the LWPM employs a conductivity that increases 
exponentially with height. A log-linear slope and a reference height define this exponential model. 
The default model defines an average value of the slope and reference height that depends on fre¬ 
quency and diurnal condition. Furthermore, the height of the nighttime ionosphere over the polar 
caps is lower than it is at middle and equatorial latitudes. This model was derived from extensive 
analysis of available measurements as described by Ferguson (1980, 1992) and Moifitt (1977). The 
default model of the lower boundary of the waveguide is based on the Westinghouse Geophysics 
Laboratory conductivity map (Morgan, 1968). 

Propagation paths are broken into a series of horizontally homogeneous segments. The distribution 
and the parameters of the segments are determined by changes in the ionosphere, ground conductiv¬ 
ity, and the geomagnetic field. The LWPM uses two procedures to calculate the mode solutions for 
each horizontally homogeneous segment. Segments with a common ground conductivity and iono¬ 
sphere are grouped together and processed in order of increasing distance from the transmitter. At the 
beginning of each of these groups, a mode-searching algorithm is used to obtain starting solutions. 
This algorithm is essentially that of Morfitt and Shellman (1979). The mode solutions in the remain¬ 
ing segments of a particular group are obtained by extrapolating up to three sets of existing solutions 
by using distance from the transmitter as the extrapolation variable. The extrapolated solutions are 
adjusted for the effects of the geomagnetic field by using a Newton-Raphson iteration technique. If 
the distance over which the extrapolation is performed is too large, or the extrapolation or the itera¬ 
tion gives invalid modes, the modes of the segment are found by using the mode-searching algo¬ 
rithm. The extrapolation and iteration procedure is then restarted. This combination of rigorous mode 


2 



searching and extrapolation followed by iterative correction gives the most efficient generation of the 
required mode parameters along the propagation path. 

The LWPC uses a mode-conversion model (Ferguson and Snyder, 1980) to connect the series of 
horizontally homogenous segments along every propagation path. The most accurate implementation 
of the mode-conversion model integrates the radio fields vertically over the boundary between seg¬ 
ments. This integration can be quite time consuming. A reasonably accurate and much faster running 
implementation replaces the full-wave integration with an approximation based on the notion that 
most of the interaction of the radio wave takes place within the reflection height of the ionosphere. 
The default implementation of the mode-conversion model is the approximate one. In rare cases, the 
full-wave model must be employed to ensure accuracy. Unfortunately, there is no test that can be per¬ 
formed ahead of time to ensure that this option is necessary. The user must review the output of the 
program, particularly graphs of the signal strength versus distance, to ensure that they make sense. 
Generally, the need to use the fiill-wave model is readily apparent in these graphs. 

The LWPC is typically used to generate geographical maps of signal availability for coverage 
analysis. The program makes it easy to set up these displays by automating most of the required 
steps. The program automatically selects paths along geographic bearing angles at a coarse resolution 
of 15° to ensure that the operating area is fully covered. More paths are added as necessary, at a finer 
resolution of 3°, to ensure that all significant low-conductivity areas of the ground are included in 
the coverage analysis. Figure 1 illustrates this automatic path selection for a transmitter located in 
North Dakota and an operating area that encloses the Mediterranean Sea. In the color rendition of 
this map, the areas shown in yellow, black, red, and purple are regions of low ground conductivity. In 
this figure, these areas are found in eastern Canada and Greenland. The figure shows the boundary of 
the operations area and all of the propagation paths automatically selected by the LWPM. Three of 
the paths are shown as solid lines. These are the ones from the pass using coarse resolution (30°, 

45°, and 60°). The dashed lines show the paths selected during the second pass. These are required 
to ensure that the low-conductivity areas are included in the coverage.

GEOPHYSICAL MODEL 

As already noted, a waveguide model is used for propagation in the LWPM. The boundaries of this 
waveguide are the earth’s surface and the ionosphere. The lower boundary is considered to be a set 
of semi-infinite regions of fixed conductivity extending downward from the surface. The parameters 
of the upper boundary vary depending primarily on solar radiation. The electron density and the 
earth’s geomagnetic field control the interaction of the radio waves with the ionosphere. The effect of 
the geomagnetic field is small in the daytime and significant in the nighttime. 

THE IONOSPHERE 

There are two major transitions in the ionosphere. One of these transitions is between daytime and 
nighttime. The other transition occurs in the nighttime between middle geomagnetic latitudes and 
polar latitudes. The nighttime ionosphere in the polar latitudes is strongly influenced by injections of 
solar particles guided there by the earth’s geomagnetic field. In the simple model of the ionosphere 
used in the LWPM, the effect of these particles is to lower the effective height of the ionosphere. The 
solar zenith angle is the key parameter used to determine the ionospheric profile at each point along 
the path. The daytime ionosphere is specified for solar zenith angles less than 90° and the nighttime 
ionosphere for solar zenith angles greater than 99°. For nighttime paths, the geomagnetic dip angle 
determines the geomagnetic latitude. The nighttime latitudinal transition from middle to polar lati¬ 
tudes takes place between geomagnetic dip angles of 70° and 74°. 

The model of the ionosphere used in the LWPM produces an exponential increase in conductivity 
with height specified by a slope, P, in km“^ and a reference height, h’, in km. Values for p and h’ are 


4 




specified by the program for both daytime and nighttime at each of two reference frequencies. Given 
the frequency specified by the user, values of P and h’ for day and for night are obtained by linear 
interpolation in frequency. Between the daytime and nighttime values of P and h’, five additional 
values of p and h’ are calculated at equal intervals. Figure 2 illustrates how these five intervals define 
the basic dawn/dusk transition.

SOLAR ZENITH ANGLE (deg) 

Figure 2. Illustration of the day/night transition. 

When the path is fully night, h’ also depends on the geomagnetic dip angle. This dependence is 
chosen so that the h’ for the polar nighttime ionosphere is the midpoint of the intervals between day 
and night. Thus, the last four segments of the day-to-night transition are used to make the transition 
from middle latitudes to polar latitudes when the propagation path is in night. However, the magnetic 
dip angle, rather than the solar zenith angle, controls the ionosphere. Figure 3 illustrates this transi¬ 
tion. This simple model is used to provide a reasonable set of ionospheric profiles to handle all the 
transitions in the ionosphere. A more sophisticated model is not warranted because of a lack of data.

The numerical specification of the model of the ionosphere used in this program is derived from 
Morfitt (1977) and Ferguson (1980) and is the same as in previous versions of the LWPC (Ferguson 
and Snyder, 1989b). This model sets the value of P and h’ for the daytime and nighttime ionosphere 
separately. The daytime ionosphere has a constant value of P equal to 0.3 km“l and a constant value 
of h’ equal to 74 km. The nighttime ionosphere is more complicated in that p varies with frequency 
while h’ is constant at 87 km. The variation with frequency has p varying from 0.3 km“* at 10 kHz to 
0.8 km“^ at 60 kHz. Table 1 shows the values of the ionospheric parameters at 30 kHz. Figure 4 
illustrates the two transitions, as they would be defined along a hypothetical path that traverses the 
pole from day to night using the parameters in this table.

Although not shown in table 1 and figures 2 through 4, the LWPM uses solar zenith angles in a 
way that indicates whether the direction of propagation is from midnight toward noon or vice versa. 
Thus, for every set of ranges on the left side of table 1, there is a mirrored set of negative values of 
solar zenith angles. The current implementation of the LWPM treats the transition from midnight to 
noon the same as that from noon to midnight.

PATH SEGMENTATION 

Geometrically, a propagation path is a great circle from the transmitter. The LWPM models the 
variation of the geophysical parameters along the path as a series of horizontally homogeneous seg¬ 
ments. To do this, the program determines the ground conductivity, dielectric constant, orientation of 
the geomagnetic field with respect to the path and the solar zenith angle at small fixed-distance inter¬ 
vals along each path. At each of the small intervals, these parameters are examined to determine if a 
new segment of the earth-ionosphere waveguide needs to be set. The goal of this process is to 
include important features of the propagation path while keeping the number of segments to a com¬ 
putationally manageable level. An additional consideration is the balancing of the completeness of 
the mode-searching algorithm with the speed of the extrapolation and iteration algorithm as it pro¬ 
cesses many segments. Figure 5 illustrates the decision-making process. It accounts in large part for 
the differences in how the waveguide-mode solutions vary under differing ionospheric conditions 
and from one geomagnetic condition to another. For example, propagation anisotropy is considerably 


6 



diminished under day conditions as compared to nighttime conditions. Therefore, the variation of the 
geomagnetic parameters between points on the path is allowed to be larger in daytime than at night. 
In figure 5, the appearance of “SAVE” indicates that a horizontally homogenous path segment will 
be defined and mode parameters will be computed for that segment. It should be noted that the mini¬ 
mum length of a segment is 100 km.

ATMOSPHERIC NOISE 


The LWPC allows for three models of atmospheric noise. The model named ITSN is the imple¬ 
mentation of CCIR 322 (CCIR, 1963), which maps the basic noise map parameter, Fam, in Universal 
time. The model named NTIA is the new noise model developed by using additional measurements 
and has since become the new CCIR model described in CCIR Report 322-3 (CCIR, 1986). These 
two models are based on surface mappings of measurements at a limited number of sites. The model 
named LNP is a lightning-based model developed by Pacific Sierra Research for the Office of Naval 
Research and the Defense Nuclear Agency (Warber and Shearer, 1994). This model calculates atmos¬ 
pheric noise by summing the contributions from lightning all over the world after calculating the 
effects of propagation from the lightning to the receiver. Thus, it is computationally quite compli¬ 
cated and slow running. 

The nature of atmospheric noise can have a dramatic effect on the performance of radio receivers. 
Receivers are designed with algorithms designed to minimize the most important detrimental effects 
of atmospheric noise. However, the key to understanding how the receivers will perform in different 
locations and times is proper modeling of the critical parameters of atmospheric noise. Typically, 
these parameters are the mean value, the standard deviation of the variation, and the impulsiveness of 
the noise. The latter is described by the ratio of the rms to the average of the noise expressed in dB, 
which is called the Vd. The variation of these parameters of atmospheric noise over time and position 
is quite different among these models, so the coverage assessments produced simply by changing the 
model of atmospheric noise can be spectacular. 

RECEIVER MODEL 

Two models of receiver performance have been incorporated into the LWPC. One of these is 
described by Buckner and Daghestani (1993) and designated as PSR, and the other is described by 
Smith et al. (1997) and designated as MITRE. The curves in figure 6 illustrate the relative gain in the 
noise-reduction circuit (NRC) as a function of the noise parameter, Vd. The PSR model (dashed line) 
shows significant gains for Vd greater than 12 dB but equally significant reductions in performance 
when Vd is less than 7 dB. On the other hand, the MITRE model (solid line) produces a much more 
conservative picture of receiver performance with regard to the impulsiveness of the atmospheric 
noise.

DRIVER PROGRAM 

The program named LWPM sets up propagation paths and organizes the calculation of solutions to 
the earth-ionosphere waveguide (mode parameters). Basic input to the program consists of a root file 
name (used to define the names of output files), transmitter parameters, and the diurnal condition. 

The basic transmitter parameters consist of its location and frequency. The diurnal condition may be 
specified as all day, all night, or as a specific date and time. The propagation paths can be defined by 
specifying geographical bearing angles, receiver locations, or an operating area. These control strings 
are placed in files with the extension “INP” (for Inputs). 

After the necessary control strings and their associated data are specified, a specific control string 
is used to initiate the calculations. As the calculation of mode parameters along each path is com¬ 
pleted, the parameters are written to a file named with the extension “MDS” (for Modes). Calcula¬ 
tions for successive paths continue automatically. If the generation of the data aborts for some rea¬ 
son, the user needs to correct the error (if any) and restart the program. If it exists, the LWPM reads 
the “MDS” file to find the last complete path and continues execution with the next one in sequence. 
Because of this restart capability, if for some reason, a case is being repeated using a previously used 
root file name, then the “MDS” file for the previous run must be deleted or moved to another direc¬ 
tory before the new run is started. When all paths have been processed, the program calculates the 
field strength along each path using the parameters specified for the transmitting antenna and the 
receiver. These data are written to a file named with the extension “LWF’ (for Long-Wave Fields). 

If the propagation paths are set up automatically by user specification of an operating area, the 
program uses the data in the “LWF’ file to generate a file named with the extension “GRD” (for 
Grid). The “GRD” file contains values of the signal strength and its standard deviation in a grid of 
latitude versus longitude that covers the user-specified operating area. At the same time, a corre¬ 
sponding grid file is written for the atmospheric noise. If the noise values are calculated for the NTIA 


9 




model, then the file is named with the extension “NTI”, if for the ITSN model, it is named with the 
extension “ITS”, and if for the Long-Wave Noise Program, it is named with the extension “LNP”. 
These noise models will be described in detail later in this document. Even though the noise files 
have extensions other than “GRD”, they have the same format and use as the “GRD” files containing 
signal strength data. These “GRD” files may now be used in GRDPLOT to obtain geographical dis¬ 
plays of the signal levels, noise levels, signal-to-noise levels, or, together with “GRD” files for other 
transmitters, signal-to-jammer levels. The operating-area grids are set up to give the finest resolution 
permitted within the dimensions of the program. In LWPC—2.0, the grid has 145 points in longitude 
and 73 points in latitude. The program forces the spacing in the longitude and latitude to be a multi¬ 
ple of 2 ^ 2 °, which is also the minimum spacing allowed. The program also ensures that the grids 
align along 5° boundaries. 

CONTROL STRINGS 

The input and execution of this program are directed by the use of control strings, summarized in 
table 2. The use of control strings is illustrated by the sample cases. Each of the possible control 
strings and their associated data are described below. Lines in the input file with a blank in column 1 
are treated as comments. This feature allows for convenient switching on and off of various program 
options and enables annotation of the input files.

FILE SPECIFICATION 

FELE-MDS sets the directory path for the mode parameter data files. If not specified, the program 
uses the directory in which it is being run. 

FILE-LWF sets the directory path for the files containing signal strength and phase versus dis¬ 
tance (also called mode sums). If not specified, the program uses the directory in which it is being 
run. 

FILE-GRD sets the directory path for the coverage grid data files. If not specified, the program 
uses the directory in which it is being run. 

FILE-PRF sets the directory path for the profile specification files. If not specified, the program 
uses the directory in which it is being run. 

FILE-NDX sets the directory path for the profile specification index files. If not specified, the 
program uses the directory in which it is being run. 

TX-NTR and JX-NJR are used to define the root file name for the output files. The root file name 
is a character string with no embedded blanks. The NTR and NJR are optional numbers designating 
the corresponding transmitter and jammer number, respectively. The content and usage of these files 
are indicated by the extension appended to the root file name. For example, if ROOT-FILE-NAME is 
Cutler, then the program will generate files named “Cutler.MDS” and “Cutler.LWF”. 

COVERAGE SPECIFICATION 

CASE-ID allows the user to introduce an arbitrary string of up to 80 characters into the data files. 
The programs that do graphical displays place this string in their output. Its purpose is to supplement 
the often purely numerical parameters that are also displayed. 

TX-DATA and JX-DATA are used to specify the parameters of transmitters. The first parameter 
in the data string must always be the transmitter or jammer identifier, TX-ID or JX-ID, respectively. 
This identification can be up to 20 characters. The other parameters of the transmitter are its fre¬ 
quency in kHz, latitude in degrees north, longitude in degrees west, radiated power in kW, inclination 
in degrees from the vertical, geographical heading in degrees east of north, and altitude in km of the 
short dipole antenna. The initial value of all these parameters is zero, except for power, which has the 
initial value 1. The sign convention is that latitude south and longitudes east are negative. A vertical 
antenna is defined by an inclination of zero. There are two methods for defining these transmitter 
parameters. In the first method, the parameters are simply encoded in the data string. In the second, 
the parameters are read from a file named “XMTR.LIS”. This file must be located in the directoiy 
containing the LWPC data files. This directory will be described later. The transmitter or jammer 
identification encoded in the control string is used to select the correct parameters from the file by 
matching the user-specified transmitter identification with one of those found in the file. If the trans¬ 
mitter parameters are encoded in the data string and they match those of a record in the transmitter 
list, then the user-specified transmitter identification string is changed to the one found in the file. If 
the parameters encoded in the data string are unique, then they are automatically added to the file. 
This frees the user from having to remember and repeat the parameters of the transmitters and 
enforces a consistent naming convention among multiple users of the program. 

Figure 7 illustrates a transmitter specification file. Each record in the file must contain the identifi¬ 
cation, frequency, location, power, antenna orientation, and antenna altitude. The last record must

contain the string END as shown in the figure. The first record may be an optional header that con¬ 
tains no numerical data. This works because the program does not attempt to decode the data string 
until it finds a match between the user-specified TX-ID and an entry in the data file. The identifica¬ 
tion string supplied in the data string and the identification strings in the specification file are con¬ 
verted to uppercase characters before they are compared with each other. Thus, Anthom is treated 
the same as ANTHORN. Blanks or commas separate the parameters in both the data string and the 
records of the specification file. The order of the values is important but not the format of the input 
(as long as it is compatible with the type of the variable). Thus, the careful alignment of columns 
shown in the figure is not necessary. Since the program does not process values beyond the antenna 
altitude, additional information may be included in the records following the anteima altitude, as 
illustrated. 

OP-AREA is used to define a set of paths that span an operating area. These paths will be used to 
produce coverage maps. The control string defines the boundaries of the operating area. In a manner 
similar to that used for TX-DATA and JX-DATA, these boundaries can be specified in one of two 
ways. The first parameter in the data string must always be the area identification, AREA-ID, con¬ 
taining up to 20 characters. This identification may be followed by the latitude and the longitude of 
the lower left-hand comer and the upper right-hand comer of the area in order of its southern lati¬ 
tude, western longitude, northern latitude, and eastern longitude. Alternatively, if just the area 
identification is specified, the boundaries of the operating area are to be found in a file named 
“AREA.LIS” located in the directory that contains the LWPC data files. If AREA-ID is followed by a 
single parameter or string, then that parameter or string is assumed to be the name of an alternate file 
containing area specification data. In either of these latter two cases, the AREA-ID is used to select 
the parameters of the op area from the file. 

Figure 8 illustrates an operating-area specification file. The file may begin with a header to iden¬ 
tify the parameters to follow in a maimer similar to that used in the transmitter specification file. The 
last record must contain the termination string END. As with the transmitter specification, the area 
identification is always converted to uppercase before testing for a match between that specified by 


13 






the user and that found in the file. If the operating-area parameters are encoded in the control string 
and they match those of a record in the LWPC data file named “AREA.LIS”, then the user-specified 
area identification string is changed to the one found in the list. If the parameters encoded in the data 
string are unique, then they are automatically added to the file. This frees the user from having to 
remember and repeat the parameters of operating areas in the files.

Figure 8. Sample operating-area file. 

When the OP-AREA control string is used, the bearing angles of the paths are selected automa¬ 
tically. In the first pass, a coarse selection is made at 15° intervals. A second pass adds paths at a 
bearing-angle resolution of 3°, chosen to ensure that significant low-conductivity areas that might be 
encountered by the paths are included. Furthermore, the lengths of the paths are truncated to conform 
to the dimensions of the operating area. In other words, each path is only as long as it needs to be to 
cover the operating area. This option is used to create a “GRD” file. The name of this file will be 
formed by concatenating the root file name defined by TX-NTR or JX-NJR and AREA-ID. For 
example, if ROOT-FILE-NAME is Cutler and AREA-ID is Atlantic, then the program will generate a 
grid file named “CutlerAtlantic.GRD”. 

BEARINGS, RECEIVERS, and RANGE-MAX provide an alternative method for specifying 
paths. The data provided by the control strings BEARINGS and RECEIVERS define the direction 
of the paths. The control string RANGE-MAX provides a single value used to define the length of 
all paths specified with these options. The initial value of range_max is 20,000 km. The control 
string BEARINGS is followed by a list of geographical bearing angles measured in degrees east of 
north. In the event that all bearing angles are not specified in one control string, additional values of 
bearings may be supplied by using the control string +BEARINGS. The maximum number of bear¬ 
ing angles that may be defined using one BEARINGS, together with additional +BEARINGS, is 
120. Similarly, RECEIVERS is used to set up paths using a set of geographical positions. In this 
case, the data string is a list of pairs of coordinates in order of latitude and longitude. Additional pairs 
of coordinates may be supplied by using the control string -hRECEIVERS. Only pairs of coordinates 
are allowed so that use of +RECEIVERS requires that the first value in the data string be latitude. 
The maximum number of receivers is 60. If the paths are defined by using RECEIVERS, then an 
extra value of signal strength is computed by the LWPM at the distance defined by the receiver coor¬ 
dinates. This extra value is found at the end of print outs of the “LWF” files (to be discussed later). 

A-NOISE is used to specify the parameters of the atmospheric noise to be computed over the 
operating-area grid. This calculation is performed only when using OP-AREA to set up the paths. 
The first parameter in the data string is the name of one of the noise models currently available. ITSN 
names the ITS noise model of Zacharisen and Jones (1970), NTIA names the noise model of Spauld¬ 
ing and Washburn (1985), and LNP names the noise model of Warber and Shearer (1994). The data 
files for the ITSN and NTIA models are calculated by the program. A separate program, which is not 


14 





part of the LWPC, must provide the data files for the LNP model. The date and time for which the 
noise is to be computed are specified by the date and time encoded in the data string. A string of the 
form MONTH/day/year specifies the date where MONTH is the name of the month. A string of the 
form hour:minute specifies the time. The last parameter in the data string is the bandwidth in Hz for 
the noise computation. The initial value of the noise model is NTIA and of the bandwidth is 1000 Hz. 
The initial value of the day, year, and time is zero. There is no initial value for the month. 

PRESEG is used to provide user-specified path segmentation data overriding the LWPM’s auto¬ 
matic segmentation. This control string is followed by a series of records that list distances from the 
transmitter and associated path parameters. The path parameters are distance in km, geomagnetic azi¬ 
muth in degrees east of north, geomagnetic dip in degrees from the horizontal, strength of the geo¬ 
magnetic field in Webers/m^, ground conductivity index, ground conductivity in Seimens, ratio of 
the dielectric constant of the ground to that of free space, ionospheric profile index, the slope of an 
exponential ionosphere (P) in km-^ and its reference height (h’) in km. The first record must be for 
zero distance. The records are read by using a list-directed format in which each one must contain 
either a value or a placeholder for missing parameters (indicated by consecutive commas). The dis¬ 
tance from the transmitter must be given, but the remaining parameters are optional. If a placeholder 
is used for any of the geomagnetic parameters, then the LWPM calculates the relevant value. The 
user may elect to use the LWPM’s ground-conductivity values by setting the ground-conductivity 
index instead of directly setting the conductivity and the ratio of the dielectric constant relative to 
free space of the ground. Table 3 shows the ground-conductivity indices for the ground conductivity 
used in the LWPM. Thus, the user may vary the actual ground-conductivity parameters or override 
the built-in map by controlling the ordering of the default values. If placeholders fill all of the fields 
for the ground conductivity, the LWPM will provide values by using the default model. Similarly, the 
user may use the profile index either to override the order of the built-in ionospheric parameters or to 
specify arbitrary values. Consistent with table 1, the values in table 4 show the ranges of the solar 
zenith angle, the associated ionospheric profile parameters used in the LWPM, and their associated 
profile indices. Alternatively, the profile indices may refer to a set of user-specified ionospheric pro¬ 
files. This feature is described in detail in the section on ionospheric specification. Figure 9 shows a 
simple example of user-specified segmentation of a path.

IONOSPHERIC SPECIFICATION 


IONOSPHERE is used to specify the diurnal condition over all the propagation paths of a specific 
run. The first parameter in the data string defines the ionospheric model. Five models are recognized: 
LWPM, HOMOGENEOUS, CHI, RANGE, and GRID. The first of these models is the default for the 
LWPM program. This model is described elsewhere in this document. The HOMOGENE-OUS, CHI, 
RANGE, and GRID models allow the user to override the default model. The HOMOGENEOUS 
model is used to specify a uniform ionosphere over all propagation paths. The RANGE model is used 
to examine a single propagation path. In this model, the user specifies a range-dependent ionospheric 
variation. The GRID model is intended for problems in which the ionosphere varies over a user- 
specified geographic grid. The CHI model allows the user to specify profiles that depend on the 
solar zenith angle, basically overriding the default model. 

If LWPM is specified, substrings specifying the diurnal condition to be applied follow. If the sub¬ 
string is DAY, then the diurnal condition over the whole path is daylight. If the substring is NIGHT, 
then the diurnal condition over the whole path is night. The definition of the nighttime ionosphere 
includes the lower effective height of the ionosphere at polar latitudes. Although physically unrealis¬ 
tic, these two conditions are useful for some kinds of analyses. Finally, a specific date and time may 
be specified by using two substrings. The date substring contains the name of the month, the day of 
the month, and the year in the form MONTH/day/year. The date substring is followed by the time 
substring, which contains the Universal time (UT) in the form hour.-minute. The date and time are 
used to find the location of the day-night transition fi-om which an appropriate variation of the 
parameters of the ionospheric profile is defined along the path. The date substring must contain at 
least the name of the month. To set just the month and day, /year may be dropped. The calculations 
of the LWPC depend on the year only in so far as the position of the sun as seen on the earth shifts 
slightly from year to year. Similarly, just the month may be specified by dropping /day/year. The 
time substring must contain at least the hour. To set just the hour, :minute may be deleted. The initial 
value for this string is LWPM DAY. 

Two sets of substrings may follow the HORIZONTAL model name. The first set is indicated by 
EXPONENTIAL, which is followed by the numerical values of the slope and reference height of the 
profile: beta and hprime. The second substring is TABLE. This substring is followed by the root 
name of a file named “PROFILE-NAME” used to specify the names of files required for tabular 
input. A number of options are available for setting up tabular profiles. These options will be dis¬ 
cussed below. 

If the ionospheric model is RANGE EXPONENTIAL, the specification of the ionosphere along the 
path is done in a file with a name of the form “PROFILE-NAME.NDX'. This file contains a list of 
records, each containing the range and its associated slope and reference height (P, h’), with optional 
comments (records with a semicolon in column 1) as illustrated in figure 10.

TABULAR PROFILES 

Setting up tabular profiles is relatively straightforward although it can be somewhat tedious. Two 
basic files should be supplied. For range-dependent cases (to be discussed below) a third (index) file 
is needed to set the profile to be used at each distance. The first of these basic files must be named 
with the form “PROFILE-NAMEOOO.PRF’ where the “000” are all zeroes. This file is an initializa¬ 
tion file that sets up the number of species of charged particles in the ionosphere (up to 3), the colli¬ 
sion frequency, etc., as shown in table 5 and discussed below. If this file is not found, then default 
values are used. The second type of file, with a name of the form “PROFlLE-NAMEnnn.PRF\ 
specifies the charge densities as a function of height. The parameter “nnn” is the profile index that 
is defined by the user. If the ionospheric model is HOMOGENEOUS TABLE, then “nnn” is not 
required. Note that the extension in all cases is “PRF’. The index file (if needed) must have a name 
of the form “PROFILE-NAME.NDJCL

The first record in the “PRF” files is identification. For example, a set of profiles created to simu¬ 
late a specific environment might all have the same identification, such as “Ionospheric disturbance.” 


18 




Subsequent records in the “PRF” files specify additional profile parameters. Specification of these 
other parameters in the profile files is handled with control strings in a manner similar to that used by 
the rest of the program, except that a semicolon in column 1 is used for comments instead of a blank. 
This departure from that used by the control strings is due to the frequent use of formatted columnar 
data in this form of input. 

Table 5 summarizes the control string for the profile files. SPECIES specifies the number of spe¬ 
cies in the profile table. The maximum number of species is 3; the default value is 1. If the number of 
species is 3, then it is assumed that they are electrons, positive ions, and negative ions. CHARGE 
specifies the charge of each species; the default values are 1,-1, and 1. MASS-RATIO specifies the 
mass of each species relative to that of an electron; the default values are 1, 58000, and 58000. It is 
assumed that the first species is electrons so the first value of charge and mass ratio is always 1. The 
collision frequency may be specified in one of two ways. If an exponential collision frequency is to 
be used, then the control strings COEFF-NU and EXP-NU are used. COEFF-NU specifies the 
collision-frequency at the ground in collisions per second; the default Vcdues are 1.816x10^^ 
4.54x10^, and 4.54x10^. EXP-NU specifies the slope of exponential decay of the collision- 
frequency in km“^; the default values are all -0.15 km“^. Alternatively, a tabular collision-frequency 
profile may be needed. In that case, the control string COLLISION-FREQUENCY-TABLE is 
used. This control string is followed by a table of collision frequencies as a function of height, in 
descending order of height. Each record in this table contains the height in km, the electron collision 
frequency, the first-ion collision frequency, and the second-ion collision frequency. If the second-ion 
collision frequency is not specified, then it is assumed to be the same as the first. The collision fre¬ 
quencies are specified as collisions per second. The list of collision frequencies is terminated by a 
dummy height of any negative value. 

MODEL-PRF specifies the format of the charge density tables found in the files “PROFILE- 
NAMEnnn.PRF'' described above. FORMATTED indicates the files are formatted in the same way as 
described for COLLISION-FREQUENCY-TABLE. UNFORMATTED indicates the files are unfor¬ 
matted with the data being stored as follows: nrspecies, nrhts, (/iten(i), (algen(i)ii), k=l,nrspecies), 
i=l,nrhts), where nrspecies is the number of species, nrhts is the number of heights, hten is a list of 
heights, and algen is a list of the natural logarithm of each of the charge densities. These variables 
are all 4 bytes long. It should be evident that such a binary file should be created using the same 
FORTRAN compiler and operating system used to build the LWPC. The lists are input in order of 
descending altitude. MODEL-NAME indicates the files are formatted according to a specific model 
that requires a corresponding input-processing routine supplied by the user. Figure 11 shows a sam¬ 
ple initialization file. Defaults are used for everything but the collision frequency and the number of 
species.

Figure 11. Sample “PROFILE-NAMEOOO.PRF file. 

The files named “PROFILE-NAMEnnn.PRF' are of the same form as the initialization file with 
the control string DENSITY-TABLE being used to specify the particle densities in place of the 
control string COLLISION-FREQUENCY-TABLE. This control string is followed by a table of 
charged-particle densities as a function of height. The values are input in order of descending height. 
Each record in this table contains the height in km, the electron density, and the ion density. The 
program computes the second-ion density to preserve charge neutrality. The charge densities are 
specified as particles per cubic centimeter. The list of densities is terminated by any height of nega¬ 
tive value. Figure 12 shows a file containing a tabular profile.

Figure 12. Sample “PROFILE-NAMEnnn.PRF file. 

If the ionospheric model is HOMOGENEOUS, then the foregoing descriptions are enough to set 
up the model. On the other hand, if the model is RANGE TABLE, then additional set up is required. 

In this case, there must be a set of profile files with names of the form “PROFILE-NAMEnnn.PRF\ 
where nnn is a profile index number. The indexing is completely up to the user, but the value 
encoded in the file name must always be 3 digits. Each of these files contains a tabular profile of the 
form shown in figure 12. Another file is required to specify the range at which each profile is used. 
This file must have a name of the form “PROFILE-NAME.NDX”. This file is simply a list of records, 
each containing the range and its associated profile index, with optional comments as illustrated in 
figure 13.

for RANGE TABLE option. 

The ionospheric model GRID TABLE provides a means for an elaborate geographical distribution 
of the ionosphere. The preparation of the necessary database is best accomplished with a standalone 
progrcun. The basic features described above for range-dependent tabular profiles are applied in this 
case. However, the index file is much more complicated. The user is strongly advised to study the 
subroutine named PRFL_GTBL.FOR found in the distribution library named PRF before attempting 
to use this option. 


21 






OVERRIDING THE SOLAR ZENITH ANGLE DEPENDENCE 

The remaining ionospheric models are CHI EXPONENTIAL and CHI TABLE. These models allow 
the user to override the solar zenith angle dependence used in the LWPM model. The setup of these 
models is similar to that in RANGE EXPONENTIAL and RANGE TABLE except that values of the 
solar zenith angle replace values of range in the index files. However, the user must always provide 
7 sets of values to be consistent with the LWPM model. Figure 14 illustrates a sample index file for 
the CHI EXPONENTIAL model. In this example, the day-to-night transition is shortened from 9° to 
3°. The variation of P and h’ from day to night is controlled by the user. In this case, a simple linear 
variation was chosen. If the tabular form of this model is used, then the pair of columns for P and h’ 
is replaced by a single one specifying user-defined profile indices.

OPTIONAL OUTPUTS 

GCPATH indicates that geophysical parameters along the propagation paths are to be computed 
and printed. The control string START must follow it. This option does not result in the calculation 
of mode parameters along the paths. The geophysic 2 il parameters printed are the orientation of the 
path with respect to the direction of propagation, the ground conductivity, dielectric constant, and the 
ionospheric parameters, P and h’. This is a handy way for the user to get values for setting up some 
of the more elaborate ionospheric models described above. 

RX-DATA is used to define parameters for the received fields. The first parameter is a character 
string indicating the orientation of the fields, and the second parameter is the altitude at which the 
fields are computed. The vertical electric field, TM or Ez, is obtained with the string VERTICAL. 
Both the vertical and horizontal fields, TM and TE or Ez and Ey, are calculated if the string is 
HORIZONTAL. Both of the strings may be shortened to the first character. The initial value of the 
component is VERTICAL, and the altitude at which the field is computed is zero. 

LWF-VS-DISTANCE defines the ending distance and the distance increment in km over which 
the field strength is to be computed. The initial value of the ending distance is 20,000 km. The initial 
value of the distance increment is 20 km. Although mode parameters are computed over varying 
lengths of paths, the fields are computed to the same range from the transmitter for all paths. The 
distance increment must be such that Iwf-dist-max divided by Iwf-dist-inc is less than 1001. 

LWFLDS is used to obtain additional signal-strength calculations. The most time-consuming 
process in the LWPC is the generation of the mode parameters along the propagation paths. The 


22 




calculation of the signal strength along the paths is relatively quick, so a separate mode-summing 
procedure is available. In the event that the user wants to calculate mode sums for different values 
of the transmitter antenna {inclination, heading, and talt) or receiver parameters {VERTICAL or 
HORIZONTAL or ralt), the parameters are changed by using the corresponding control strings. The 
control string LWFLDS followed by START does new signal-strength calculations and overwrites 
the existing “LWF” file. In the event that review of the graphs of signal strength versus distance 
reveals unusual patterns, the user may choose to recalculate the signal-strength data by using the full- 
wave mode-conversion model described below. This would be accomplished by using the appropriate 
control strings for the full-wave model (see MC-OPTIONS) followed by LWFLDS and START. 

OPA-GRID is used to obtain additional operating-area grid files. An important use of the LWPC 
is the generation of coverage displays. This is the reason that the specification of propagation paths 
over operating areas is automated. If a mode sum is redone (see LWFLDS) or the boundaries of the 
operating area are changed, then a new file of grid data must be generated by using the control string 
OPA-GRID followed by START. This procedure can be used to enlarge the geographical area 
enclosed by the grid file. However, enlarging the boundaries of the operating area must be done with 
caution. The extent of each propagation path is selected to reach just beyond the boundary of the 
originally specified operating area and may not be valid for a much larger area. 

MC-OPTIONS controls the mode-conversion calculation. The LWPC uses a mode-conversion 
model (Ferguson and Snyder, 1980) to connect the series of horizontally homogenous segments 
along every propagation path. The most accurate implementation of the mode-conversion model 
integrates the radio fields vertically over the boundary between segments. This integration can be 
quite time consuming. A reasonably accurate and faster running implementation replaces the full- 
wave integration with an approximation based on the notion that most of the interaction of the radio 
wave takes place within the reflection height of the ionosphere. The default implementation of the 
mode-conversion model is the approximate one. In rare cases, the full-wave model must be 
employed to ensure accuracy. The control string MC-OPTIONS in table 2 is used to control the 
mode-conversion model used by the program. The parameter named MC-STEP may have one of 
three values. FULL-WAVE calls for the fiill-wave calculations to be performed. APPROXIMATE 
indicates that only the approximate form of the calculations is to be used. MIXED indicates that a 
mix of full-wave and approximate calculations is to be performed. The MIXED implementation uses 
the approximate model except when the reference height of the ionosphere, h’, is greater than a user- 
specified value, set by mc-test. In some instances, this mix of full-wave and approximate models can 
give results almost as good as the full-wave model but in much less computer time. Unfortunately, 
one often has to run the full-wave model in order to verify the mixed results. If the full-wave model 
is to be employed, the user may choose to have the mode-conversion algorithm use the mode param¬ 
eters as calculated by the LWPM or to have it iteratively refine them to ensure the accuracy of the 
results. It is recommended that the iteration be used since the user is already accepting a large pen¬ 
alty in time for employing this model. Setting wf-iterate to TRUE turns on the iteration. 

The control strings that begin PRINT- are used to obtain additional output during the processing 
along each propagation path. These outputs can be quite voluminous. The initial value of each of 
these parameters is zero, mi nimizing the output. PRINT-SWG is used to obtain additional output 
from the LWPM during generation of the mode parameters along the propagation path. PRINT- 
SWG can have 4 values: 0 turns off the extra printout, 1 prints path parameters and a list of the mode 
solutions, 2 adds a listing of the mode parameters, and 3 adds a printout of extrapolation results. 
These parameters are written to the log file as they are computed along the paths. This output can be 
confusing because the program does not always process the segments of the paths in sequential order 


23 




starting at the transmitter. PRINT-MDS controls output while the program reads and writes the 
“MDS” file during the calculation of the signal strength along the path. It can have 2 values: 0 gives 
very terse summary output, and 1 adds a printout of the modes’ attenuation rate, etc. This output is in 
order of increasing distance from the transmitter. PRINT-MC provides additional output during the 
calculation of the mode sum. It can have 3 values: 0 produces a summary of the calculations, 1 adds 
output of the mode-conversion coefficients, and 3 adds a printout of the integrals over the slab 
boundary. PRINT-LWF prints a summary of the signal-strength calculation as it is written to an 
“LWF” file. It can have 2 values: 0 gives a very terse summary, and 1 prints out the signal strength as 
a function of distance from the transmitter along the path. PRINT-WF provides output only when 
the full mode-conversion model is being used. It can also have 3 values: 0 turns off the printout, 1 
prints the results of the iterations on the mode solutions, and 2 adds a printout of the results of the 
integration of the fields versus height. 

PLOTTING THE RESULTS 

The program LWPM does not directly provide for the graphical display of its output. Instead, 
separate programs, to be described in this section, generate graphical displays. The names of the 
programs are based on the type of file they process or the quantity to be displayed: LWFPLOT plots 
signal strength and phase versus distance, and GRDPLOT plots maps of contours of constant signal 
strength, atmospheric noise level, signal-to-noise ratio, and signal-to-jammer ratio in geographical 
displays. These programs use many of the same control strings already described for use by LWPM, 
in addition to several others that will be described below. In some instances, there are fewer parame¬ 
ters in the data strings than used by the LWPM. 


PREVIEW PLOTS 


The program PRVWPLOT provides a graphical display of the propagation paths and their seg¬ 
mentation as determined by the LWPM. This allows the user to get some idea of the magnitude of the 
case to be run before starting it and provides a useful display for presentations and review. This pro¬ 
gram accepts all the control strings used in the LWPM to eliminate the possibility of errors in setting 
up the two different runs. Table 6 shows additional control strings unique to PRVWPLOT (and also 
GRDPLOT). One of the sample cases provided with the software distribution is for this program, and 
a sample graph is shown later on in figure 23.

PLOTTER defines the plotting display device: PLT-DEVICE. This parameter may specify one of 
two operating-system devices. One device is the screen, identified as SYS-SCN, and the other is the 
local default printer, identified as SYS-PRN. Each of these strings may be shortened to the first five 
characters. If PLT-DEVICE is just SYS, then SYS-SCN is implied. The graphical output may be 
directed to any printer installed on the system provided it is the current default printer. Thus, if more 
than one printer is available, the user must manually set the desired one as the system’s default 
printer. If PLT-DEVICE is neither of the values specified above, the graphical output is written to a 
file named by the string found in PLT-DEVICE. This file may be imported as an HGL formatted file 
into PowerPoint. This is especially easy if the named file has the extension “HGL”. 

MAP-AREA defines the projection, boundaries, and dimensions of the geographical area upon 
which the operating area and the propagation paths are to be plotted. The map parameters are defined 
in a manner similar to that used to define the boundaries of the operating area. The first parameter in 
the data string must be the map identification, MAP-ID, having up to 20 characters. If the MAP-ID is 
not followed by any other information, then it is assumed that the parameters of the map are to be 
found in the map specification file named “MAP.LIS”, found in the directory containing the LWPC 
data files. This file will be searched for a record containing a match to the specified MAP-ID. If the 
MAP-ID is followed by a single parameter, that parameter is assumed to be the name of an alternate 
map area specification file, which will be searched for a record containing a match to the specified 
MAP-ID. Otherwise, the program expects to find the name of the projection and the map parameters, 
which depend on the projection. 

The following projections are available: rectangular, Mercator, gnomonic, azimuthal equidistant, 
orthographic, and stereographic. Examples of all the projections except the Mercator projection are 
shown below for a common scenario. The rectangular projection is a cylindrical map projection that 
is linear in both latitude and longitude. Thus, this projection distorts the high latitudes. Figure 1 
shows an example of this projection. The Mercator projection is the projection used in the traditional 
wall map. It shows severe distortion for latitudes above approximately 50°N. The azimuthal equidis¬ 
tant projection maps all of the points at the same distance from the center of the projection onto a 
circle. The points are placed along radials corresponding to the geographic bearing angle as meas¬ 
ured at the center point. Figure 15 is an example of an azimuthal equidistant projection. The gno¬ 
monic projection is used in sailing charts because this projection maps great circles as straight lines. 
This characteristic is clearly seen in figure 16. However, the gnomonic projection severely distorts 
areas far from the center of the map. The orthographic projection (figure 17) shows the earth as seen 
from far out in space. There is very little distortion in this map since it is similar to viewing a globe. 
The stereographic projection (figure 18) is similar to the gnomonic except that the areas near the cen¬ 
ter of the map are shown with very little distortion.

The rectangular and Mercator projections specify the boundaries of the map in order of its south¬ 
ern latitude, western longitude, northern latitude, and eastern longitude and the dimensions of the 
map. Following the conventions of the LWPC, latitudes are given in degrees North, and longitudes 
are given in degrees West. The dimensions of the map are in inches. A center point, given in order of 
the center latitude and longitude, and the maximum range to be displayed in km define all the gno- 
monic, azimuthal equidistant, orthographic, and stereographic projections. The names of the projec¬ 
tion may be shortened to the first four characters. The parameters associated with each projection are 
shown in the header records of the sample map specification file shown below. 

If the map parameters are to be found in a file, then the records of that file must contain the map 
identification, the name of the projection, the boundaries of the map, and the dimensions of the map. 
Figure 19 illustrates a map-area specification file. The file may begin with a header similar to that 
used in the operating-area specification file. In this sample, there are several headers, one for each 
projection. The last record contains the termination string END. The MAP-ID is used to select the 
parameters of the map from the file. As with the op-area specification, the map identification is 
always converted to uppercase before testing for a match between the user’s specification and that 
found in the file. Furthermore, the name of the projection supplied by the user or by the file is con¬ 
verted to lowercase before testing for the projection to be used.

Figure 19. Sample map-area file. 

If the user specifies the map parameters, then the default map specification file, “MAP.LIS”, is 
updated by using the new values. If the specification file already contains an entry with the same 
identification as the user’s, then the parameters in the file are compared with the values supplied by 
the user. Except for the dimensions of the map, if every value specified by the user does not match 
those found in the specification file, then the run is aborted. This is done to require a consistent 
naming convention for the map areas. 

If the control string OP-AREA is used to define the coverage area, then PRVWPLOT shows the 
boundaries of the specified operating area. So, the best display is obtained by making the map area 
large enough to show the whole operating area. 


28 




MAP-TYPE is used to define the way the landmasses are to be delineated. The data string may 
have one or two values. The basic map types are landmasses, ground conductivity, and coastal out¬ 
line. If the landmass or ground-conductivity maps are used, a second map type (usually the coastal 
outline) may also be used for emphasis. Table 6 shows the various combinations. If this control string 
is omitted, then the boundaries of the operating area and the propagation paths are plotted without 
delineating the landmasses. 

FIELD STRENGTH PLOTS 

The LWFPLOT routine plots signal strength as a function of distance from the transmitter in dB 
above l|xV/m. Data for each path are plotted in separate graphs. If more than one field component is 
in the file, the program plots each component with different line styles and colors on the same graph. 
The program also plots two additional lines at the bottom of each graph. One of these lines represents 
the height of the ionosphere and the other the ground conductivity. The plot representing the ground 
conductivity also contains a symbol indicating the beginning of each segment along the propagation 
path. These data are taken fi-om the path segmentation data, which are part of the file. As a reminder, 
a legend for these quantities appears at the lower right edge of each graph. The label below each 
graph includes the name of the program that generated the file, and the date the file was generated. 
The latter helps keep track of which version of the program was used. Table 7 is a summary of the 
control strings used by this program. Those that are unique to the LWFPLOT are described below. 
One of the sample cases provided with the software distribution is for this program, and a sample 
graph is shown later on in figure 28. 

TX-NTR and JX-NJR are used to name the files that contain the signal strength versus distance 
data. Although not encoded in this data string, there must exist corresponding files with the extension 
“LWF’. The substrings NTR and NJR carry over from the LWPM to help the user keep things orga¬ 
nized but only one transmitter may be plotted at a time (the last one in the input file before the 
START control string).

FILE-LWF sets the directory path for the mode sum files. If not specified, the program uses the 
directory in which it is being run. 

BEARINGS is used to select specific paths from the input file. If the data string is not blank, then 
the input file is searched for the designated bearing angles. If a designated bearing angle is found in 


29 



the file, then signal strength versus distance is plotted. If this control string is not used, then all paths 
in the file are plotted. 

MODIF-PWR is used to change the transmitter or jammer power to the specified value in kW, 
before plotting the curves of signal strength versus distance. 

DIST-AXIS contains parameters used to scale the horizontal axis of the graphs. If the parameter 
scale-x is zero, then the next three parameters are used. If scale-x is not zero, then the vertical size of 
the graph is determined from dstmax, dstmin, and scalex. If dstmax is -99 (default), then the maxi¬ 
mum value is determined from the input array of distances. All the distance values are in km. The 
scale is kilometers per inch. 

AMPL-AXIS contains parameters used to scale the vertical axis of the amplitude graphs. If the 
parameter scale-a is zero, then the next three parameters are used. If scale-a is not zero, then the 
horizontal size of the graph is determined from ampmax, ampmin, and scale-a. If ampmax is -99 
(default), then the maximum value is determined from the input array of signal strengths. All the 
amplitude values are in dB above 1 |J.V/m. The scale is dB per inch. 

PHAS-AXIS contains parameters used to scale the vertical axis of the phase graphs. If the param¬ 
eter scale-p is zero, then the next three parameters are used. If scale-p is not zero, then the horizontal 
size of the graph is determined from phsmax, phsmin, and scale-p. If either phsmax or phsmin is -99 
(default), then the corresponding value is determined from the input data. The units of the phase axis 
are set by UNITS, which may be DEGREES or MICROSEC. 

PHAS-PLOT turns plots of the phase on and off by setting OPTION to YES or NO. 

RUNNING-AVG is used to control averaging of the input data before it is graphed. The value of 
nravg specifies how many points are averaged. This is a running average so that a value output at a 
specific range is the average of the input value at the range and (nravg-1)/2 values before and after 
the range. Thus, it is common to use odd numbers for nravg. 

COVERAGE PLOTS 

The most commonly used graphical output program in the LWPC is GRDPLOT. This program 
plots contours of constant signal, signal-to-noise ratio, and signal-to-jam ratio in a geographical dis¬ 
play. The geographical areas are defined the same as in PRVWPLOT. Table 8 shows a complete list 
of the control strings for this program. Since most of the control strings have already been described, 
not all of the available ones will be discussed here.

TX-NTR and JX-NJR are used to name the files that contain the operating-area grid data. 
Although not encoded in the control string, corresponding files with the extension “GRD” must 
exist. The substring NTR carries over from the LWPM to help the user keep things organized, but 
only one transmitter may be used at a time. Thus, the program does not use the numerical value of 
NTR. However, the numerical value of the substring NJR indicates the jammer numbers used in the 
control strings that start with PLT-S/J and PLT-J/N, as described later. 

FILE-GRD sets the directory path for the coverage grid data files. If not specified, the program 
uses the directory in which it is being run. 

PLOT-LBL allows the user to add a character string to each graph that is generated. The string is 
the same for all graphs in a particular set and is placed along the bottom of each graph. 


31 



RX-DATA is used to specify the field component to be used by GRDPLOT when plotting the grid 
files. The data string contains either VERTICAL or HORIZONTAL. 

OP-AREA is used to specify the operating area used to create the “GRD” file in a manner identi¬ 
cal to that used by LWPM. The “GRD” file used by the program is named by concatenating the name 
specified by the control strings TX-NTR and JX-NJR with the AREA-ID. 

CNTR-RANGE is used to specify a range of contour levels to be plotted. The data string contains 
three values: cntr-min, cntr-max, and cntr-inc. In this case, the contour lines are plotted from the 
minimum value to the maximum value in evenly spaced increments. The units of the parameters 
depend on the coverage map being generated; namely, if the contour map is for signal, then cntr-min, 
cntr-max, and cntr-inc are in dB above 1 pV/m; if for signal-to-noise ratio, then they are dB. The 
contour levels are plotted as color-filled bands using the eight colors specified in the 
“GRAPHICS .INI” file described below. 

CNTR-LEVELS is used to specify a list of up to nine specific contour levels to be plotted. The 
units of the levels depend on the coverage map being generated; namely, if the contour map is for 
signal, then cntr-min, cntr-max, and cntr-inc are in dB above 1 pV/m; if for signal-to-noise ratio, 
then they are dB. The contour levels are plotted as color-filled bands using the eight colors specified 
in the “GRAPHICS.INI” file. The list of contour levels is processed as sequential pairs so that at 
least two values must be specified. 

RX-MODEL identifies the model of receiver performance to be used. As already described, there 
are two receiver models. One of these was developed by PSR and is identified as PSR. The other 
model was developed by MITRE and is identified as MITRE. 

TA-LEVELS is used to specify up to three time availabilities for which separate coverage maps 
are to be generated. These levels represent the percentage of time that a signal or signal-to-noise ratio 
is exceeded. 

THRESHOLDS is used to specify up to seven values for time availability contours. These levels 
are in the units appropriate for the contours being plotted. For example, if the threshold is for signal, 
then the units are dB above 1 pV/m; if for signal-to-noise ratio, then the units are dB. If THRESH¬ 
OLDS are specified, then contours of time availability are automatically selected. 

A-NOISE is used to specify the parameters of the atmospheric noise to be used to generate con¬ 
tour maps of signal-to-noise ratio and signal-to-interference ratio. The parameters supplied in the 
data string are used to find the appropriate grid data file that is assumed to exist. The extension of the 
noise grid data file indicates the name of the noise model: “NTT” is for the NTIA model, “ITS” is for 
the rrSN model, and “LNP” is for the LNP model. The full name of this file will be formed by con¬ 
catenating the root file name defined by TX-NTR or JX-NJR and AREA-ID. For example, if ROOT- 
FILE-NAME is Cutler and AREA-ID is Atlantic, then the program looks for a noise grid file named 
“CutlerAtlantic.NTI”, “CutlerAtlantic.ITS”, or “CutlerAtlantic.LNP”. 

P-NOISE is used to specify the mean level in dB of a source of interference other than atmos¬ 
pheric noise. This interference level is treated as a noise floor in that it becomes important as the 
atmospheric noise approaches the level of the interference. Since the source of this interference is 
assumed to be man-made, there is no standard deviation associated with it. 


32 



The control strings that start with PLT- determine the number and type of contour plots produced 
in a run. The data strings PLT-S, PLT-N, and PLT-S/N have numerical inputs of one or zero, to turn 
on or to turn off plotting a corresponding map of contours of signal, noise, and signal-to-noise ratio. 
The data string of PLT-J is a list of jammer numbers for which contour maps of signal level are to be 
made by using the designated jammers. The jammer numbers are taken from the NJR substring of the 
control string JX-NJR. If only one jammer is used, then either JX or JX-1 can be used. Similarly, 
the data string for PLT-J/N identifies the transmitters for which jammer-to-noise contours are to be 
made. The list of jammers does not have to be the same as used in the PLT-J control string. 

The control string PLT-S/J sets up contour maps of signal-to-jam ratio. The data string associated 
with this control string can be much more complicated than those associated with PLT-S and PLT-S/N 
because this data string contains a list of combinations of jammers. For example, if three jammers 
have been identified, then the data string can contain any of the following: 1, 2, 3,12, 13, 23, and 
123, indicating contours of signal-to-jammer 1, signal-to-jammer 2, signal-to-jammer 3, signal-to-the 
sum of jammers 1 and 2, and so on. Similarly, the data string associated with the control string PLT-S/I 
is also a list of combinations of jammers. This control string generates contours of the ratio of signal- 
to-jammer plus atmospheric noise. 

Figure 20 illustrates a sample input file for GRDPLOT using multiple jammers. The file contain¬ 
ing the transmitter signal data is in a file named “XMTR.GRD”, and those of the jammers are in files 
named “JAMRl.GRD”, “JAMR2.GRD”, and “JAMR3.GRD.” These files are introduced to the 
program by using the control strings TX, JX-1, JX-2, and JX-3, respectively. The PLT- control 
strings call for signal-strength plots for the transmitter and the second jammer. In addition, plots of 
the ratio of signal-to-jam for jammer 1 and the sum of jammers 1 and 3 are to be done. The CNTR- 
RANGE control string indicates that the range of contours is to be selected from the data and that the 
increment between levels is 3 dB.

FILE SUMMARIES 

The program named SCAN provides summaries of the contents of the output files of the LWPC. 
The program provides different levels of output depending on the user’s specification. The program 
is set up to interactively get the names of the files to be scanned. However, it can be started with a 


33 




command line entry identifying the name of an input file. This is illustrated in the sample case named 
SCAN. If the file to be scanned has the extension “MDS”, there are two levels of printout. The low¬ 
est level of output is a summary of the transmitter, op area, and the bearing angles; and lengths and 
segmentation of all the paths. The next level of output adds the mode parameters at each segment of 
every path. If the file to be scanned has the extension “LWF”, there are three levels of output. The 
lowest level is a summary of the transmitter, op area, and the bearing angles; and lengths of every 
path. The next level adds the signal strength and relative phase along every path. The third level of 
printout only provides the signal strength and relative phase at the receiver coordinates. This output 
only makes sense if the propagation paths are specified using the RECEIVERS and -hRECEIVERS 
control strings. If the file to be scanned has the extension “GRD”, “NTI”, “ITS”, or “LNP”, there is 
only one level of printout. This output shows the transmitter, op area, grid coordinates, and dimen¬ 
sions. 

Every file written by the programs of the LWPC contain three unique records. Every level of out¬ 
put provided by SCAN shows these records, identified by the string “file id”. In an “MDS” file, only 
the first record is defined. In an “LWF’ file, the first two records are defined. In a “GRD”, “NTI”, 
“ITS”, and “LNP” file, all three records are defined. Figure 21 shows an example of these three 
records, taken from a “GRD” file. The first record identifies the “MDS” file from which the “LWF” 
and “GRD” files were generated. The first entry in this record contains the date the file was written. 
The second entry is a three-character sequence created by a random-number generator using the field 
for seconds in the time of day as the seed. This entry is unique to the run in which the data cire gener¬ 
ated. Hence, if the series of data files from “MDS” through “GRD” are all created in a single execu¬ 
tion of the LWPM, this field will be the same in all three records. The third entry identifies the pro¬ 
gram used to create the data, and the last entry contains the full filename of the file. These entries are 
designed to keep track of inconsistencies between the data contained in the files and user-generated 
labels and identifications, which may change fi’om run to run. The second record in this figure identi¬ 
fies these same quantities in the “LWF’ file, and the third record is for the “GRD” files.

SAMPLE CASES 

The sample cases (table 9) are not meant to be exhaustive tests of the programs, but to be exam¬ 
ples of the usage of the various options. These samples are included with the distribution of the soft¬ 
ware. The primary output files from the LWPC are the ones with extension “MDS”, “LWF”, and 
“GRD.” These are not included with the distribution because they are unformatted. However, this 
report shows the graphical output for the cases that may be compared to the user’s results. The sam¬ 
ple run streams are named with the extension “INP” and the resulting logs are named with the exten¬ 
sion “LOG.” Command files named with the extension “CMD” appropriate for running the sample 
cases under OS/2 or Windows NT are also provided. Table 9 lists these sample cases with a brief 
description of the options being exercised. A few of these cases are discussed in more detail.

the sample case named LWPM. The contours in figure 26 are for the signal-to-atmospheric-noise ratio 
at 90% time availability. The rapid drop in signal-to-noise ratio as propagation paths cross Greenland 
is seen in the closely spaced and nearly vertical contour lines in the eastern part of the operating area.

is a summary of the important path segmentation data, namely, the height of the ionosphere and the 
ground conductivity. The beginning of each segment is indicated by a small symbol in the curve rep¬

LWPC DATA FILES 


The LWPC requires a number of data files for its execution. These files contain geophysical infor¬ 
mation such as ground conductivity, coastal outline coordinates, and coefficients for the atmospheric 
noise. The program also requires a file for graphical initialization and specification of transmitter 
coordinates and map area boundaries. These files must all be located in a common directory, typi¬ 
cally named “LWPC_DAT” or “LWPCVData”. 

LWPC DATA LOCATION 

A file named “IwpcDAT.loc” must be placed at the root of drive C. There is no case sensitivity in 
the file name on computers running OS/2 or Windows 95/NT so the name as shown is just a matter 
of style or taste. This file contains only one record identifying the path to the LWPC data files. Using 
one of the above examples, this record would look like “C:\LWPC\Data\” if it referred to a directory 
named “\LWPC\Data\” on drive C. 

GEOPHYSICAL DATA 

The ground-conductivity map is stored in a text file named “COND$D.DAT” and in a binary file 
named “COND$F.DAT. The program uses the text file to specify the ground conductivity. The pro¬ 
gram uses the binary file to display the ground-conductivity areas graphically. The coastal outline 
database is contained in a binary file named “COAST$D.DAT”. The coefficients used to calculate 
the levels of atmospheric noise are stored in the binary files named “ITSNSD.DAT” for the ITSN 
model and in “NTIA$D.DAr’ for the NTIA model. 

TRANSMITTER AND MAP SPECIFICATION 

The user has two methods of setting parameters associated with the control strings TX-DATA, 
JX-DATA, OP-AREA, and MAP-AREA. If the user specifies the parameters of the control string 
explicitly in the data string, then the corresponding specification file found in the directory contain¬ 
ing the LWPC data files is updated by using the new values. If the specification file already contains 
an entry with the same identification as used by the user, the parameters in the file are compared with 
the values supplied by the user. With one exception, if every value specified by the user does not 
match those found in the specification file, then the run is aborted. This is done to require a consis¬ 
tent namin g convention for transmitters, operating areas, and map areas. The exception noted above 
is for MAP-AREA. The user may change the dimensions. The user can edit the specification files to 
clean them up and remove entries as required. These files must be located in the directory containing 
the LWPC data files. The transmitter specification file is named “XMTR.LIS”, the op-area specifica¬ 
tion file is named “AREA.LIS”, and the map-area specification file is named “MAP.LIS”. 

GRAPHICS INITIALIZATION 

The graphical output provided by the LWPC is controlled in part by an initialization file named “GRA¬ 
PHICS .INI”. Figure 29 is a sample of this file. This file identifies colors and fill patterns for contour fill 
areas and geophysical displays. There are two sections in this file. The first section identifies color 
assignments and is preceded by a control string “colors” and terminated by a control string “end”. Simi¬ 
larly, the second section is demarked by the strings “fills” and “end”. The order of these sections may 
be reversed within the file. The records containing the string “colors” and “fills” may contain additional 
identification as illustrated in the figure. Each record in the colors section must contain the following 
data: name of the color, the red-green-blue (RGB) sequence used to define the color, and a pen number.

Figure 29. Sample graphics initialization file. 

The programs of the LWPC fix the names of the colors. However, the user may change the color 
displayed by changing the RGB sequence to suit individual taste. For example, a lighter shade of 
green could be displayed by changing the RGB sequence for “green” to 000 125 000. The pen num¬ 
ber is written to the HPGL output files in place of the color or RGB sequence. Importing HPGL files 
into PowerPoint only allows specification of pen numbers to identify colors, and the maximum num¬ 
ber of pens (colors) is eight. The colors named “coast”, “land”, “border”, “grid”, “oparea”, and “ter¬ 
minator” are used for the corresponding display in the graphical output. The colors named “colorN”, 
where “N” is 1 through 8, are used in numerical order to color the contour plots generated by 
“GRDPLOT”. If the file provided with the software distribution is modified, care should be taken to 
ensure that the pen numbers assigned to these eight colors do not match the one used for the land- 
mass overlay.

OUTPUT DATA FILES 


The output files are all written in unformatted form and a special program named SCAN is used to 
print out summaries of the parameters that are stored in them. Some parameters share common usage 
throughout the full set of output data files. Whenever appropriate, the parameters from one file are 
passed on to subsequent types of files to provide continuity and some audit-trail information. The 
first record of all data file types contains the same information. The first record contains an eight- 
character string to be used to record archive information. This record also contains three strings, 
named MDS-FILE-ID, LWF-FILE-ID, and GRD-FILE-ID. Each of these strings contains the date the 
file was written; a randomly generated, three-character string to uniquely identify the file; and the 
full file name, including the directory tree. The presence of these strings in each type of file provides 
information regarding the history of the data used to produce the file. For instance, each “GRD” file 
identifies the “LWF’ file that provided the signal strength data and the “MDS” file that provided the 
“MDS” data used to calculate the “LWF” data. The program identification will be LWPM-V20. The 
first record also contains a list of parameters to identify the propagation paths for the data sets. The 
character string PATH-ID contains iht AREA-ID if the paths were defined with an OP-AREA control 
string. Bearings if the paths were defined with the BEARINGS control string, and Receivers if the 
paths were defined with the RECEIVERS control string. If the RECEIVERS control string was 
used, then the list of receiver coordinates is stored in the arrays rxlat and rxlon. If the OP-AREA 
control string was used, then the lengths of the paths are stored in the array range; otherwise, the 
array range stores the constant value specified by the control string RANGE-MAX. Also, if the 
control string OP-AREA was used, then the boundaries of the operating area are stored in this first 
record. 

Figure 30 shows the data written to the “MDS” files. Character strings are shown in uppercase, 
and the length of each string is shown in brackets following the name of the string. Record 2 identi¬ 
fies the parameters of each segment of each path, beginning with the geographical bearing angle 
(bmg), the length of the path (rhomax), the receiver coordinates {rlat, rlon), and the range to the 
receiver (rrho). Additional parameters are stored in the array paraml. Currently, this array contains 
10 parameters: the coordinates of the beginning of the segment (lat. Ion), the range from the trans¬ 
mitter to the beginning of the segment (rho), the orientation and strength of the geomagnetic field 
with respect to the direction of propagation (azim, dip, magfld), the ground conductivity and dielec¬ 
tric constant (sigma, epsr), and the slope and reference height of the exponential ionosphere (beta, 
hprime). Record 3 contains the eigen angle of the mode and the following five parameters stored in 
the array param2: Tl, T2, T3, T4, f(R) (Ferguson and Snyder, 1980). The end of segment data for 
each path is indicated by a dummy record containing: brng, rhomax, rlat, rlon, rrho, 0,1, 0, 99. 
Records 2 and 3 are repeated for each path.

Figure 30. Order of data parameters in “MDS” files. 

Figure 31 summarizes the output written to “LWF’ files. Record 2 contains a summary of the 
parameters along each path. The array sgmnt stores the path segmentation data for each path in the 
data set. At present, the number of parameters stored in sgmnt is stored in nrps, and the number of 
segments is stored in nrsgmnt. The array sgmnt contains the following 10 parameters: the coordinates 
of the beginning of each segment (lot, Ion), the range from the transmitter to the beginning of the 
segment (rho), the orientation and strength of the geomagnetic field with respect to the direction of 
propagation (azim, dip, magfld), the ground conductivity and dielectric constant (sigma, epsr), and 
the slope and reference height of the exponential ionosphere (beta, hprime). If nonexponential pro¬ 
files are used, an eleventh parameter showing the profile index is added. The number of points at 
which the signal strength and relative phase are computed is stored in nrptl. The signal strength and 
relative phase along each path is calculated parametric in the following seven parameters: the num¬ 
ber of field components (nrcmp), the transmitter power (power), the distance from the transmitter 
(dist), the orientation of the antenna (inclination, heading), and the altitude of the trans mi tter and the 
receiver (talt, ralt). The parameter dist is not used in LWPC-2.0; it is included for compatibility with 
a planned extension of the mode su mmi ng capability. The values of these parameters, excluding 
nrcmp, are stored in the array param. The number of such parametric records determines the number 
of signal-strength arrays written to the file. The number of these records is stored in nrpt2. Record 3 
stores the distance, signal strength, and phase relative to the propagation in free space. The array xy 
stores the distances from the transmitter at which signal strength and relative phase are computed; 
amp stores the signal strength in dB above IjlV/m; and phs stores the relative phase. Record 3 is 
repeated as required by the value of nrcmp and nrptl (in LWPC-2.0, nrptl is always 1). Records 2 
and 3 are repeated for each path.

Figure 31. Order of data parameters in “LWF” fiies. 

Figure 32 summarizes the data written to the “GRD” files. The parameters nrcmp and nrptl 
are carried over from the “LWF’ file. Record 2 identifies the operating area and its boundaries 
(AREA-ID, xlatl, xlonl, xlat2, xlonl) and the number of points in the grid in longitude (nrlon) and 
latitude (nrlat). The grids of signal strength and associated standard deviation of the signal are writ¬ 
ten parametric in the same set of parameters used for the “LWF” files. Consequently, record 3 is 
repeated as required by the values of nrcmp and nrptl (in LWPC-2.0, nrpt2 is always 1). Records 2 
through 3 are repeated for each operating area. The array param stores the parameters of the grid 
data: the transmitter power (power), the distance from the transmitter (dist), the orientation of the 
transmitting antenna (inclination, heading), the altitude of the transmitter and the receiver (talt, ralf), 
the date and time (MONTH, day, year, UT), the bandwidth (bandw), the adjustment factor for hori¬ 
zontal noise (adjny), and the standard deviation of the signal (stndev). Furthermore, if the “GRD” file 
is for atmospheric noise, then CASE-ID contains the string Noise-, XMTR-ID contains the name of the 
noise model and the date and time used to compute the values of atmospheric noise.

SOFTWARE INSTALLATION 


The source-code files and data files are distributed in three zip files (lwpcv20, IwpcData, baseline) 
that fit on two standard 1440-kilobyte, 3.5-inch floppy diskettes. To obtain a copy of these files, 
contact Jerry Ferguson (e-mail: ferguson@spawar.navy.mil). 

For use on computers running Windows NT*, the executable program files and binary data files 
are distributed in three other zip files (IwpcExe, IwpcDat, IwpcPlt) that fit on two standard 
1440-kilobyte, 3.5-inch floppy diskettes. 

Create a directory to contain the LWPC files, assumed to be “C:\LWPCv20\”. Copy the distribu¬ 
tion files into this directory and execute the file “Staitup.cmd” to unpack the files. 

If the LWPC files are placed in a directory not named “C:\LWPCv20\”, then edit the file named 
“setLWPC.cmd” to show the correct path. 

Execute the file “BuildLWPC.cmd” to create the library, binary data files, and executable files. 

If the executable files and the binary data files are to be used as provided in the software distribution, 
copy the zip files from the diskettes into the LWPC directory. Execute the file named “Binary.cmd” to 
unpack the files. 

The LWPC data files are placed in a subdirectory named “Data”. If these files are placed in a 
directory not named “C:\LWPCv20\Data\”, edit the file named “IwpcDAT.loc” to show the correct 
path and copy it to the root directory of drive C. 

Execute the sample cases to verify the correct installation. 

The subdirectory named “C:\LWPCv20\Baseline\” contains backup copies of the sample cases and 
the resulting output. The files in this directory should not be modified in any way. 

OPERATING SYSTEM AND COMPILER 

The programs of the LWPC as distributed are written for the Windows NT® operating system and 
the WATCOM C and FORTRAN compilers. The routines written in C provide the graphical interface 
between the FORTRAN routines and the screen and printer. In the subdirectory named Library, these 
routines all have names that begin with “sys_”. The FORTRAN routines whose names end with the 
string “Plot” are really subroutines to the graphics driver named “GRFDiiver”, which is written in C, 
found in the subdirectory named GRFDriver. The compiler flags and linking options can be found in 
the file named “BuildLWPC.cmd”, which is executed to create the programs from the source files. 
Finally, the following routines are used to make compiler-specific calls to obtain system-dependent 
parameters: get_command_line.for, get_date.for, get_random.for, and get_time.for.

13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words) 


This document describes a revision of the Navy’s Long-Wavelength Propagation Capability (LWPC) developed 
by the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego. This version of the program includes improvements to 
the graphics routines, increased flexibility in specification of alternative ionospheric models, and an option to 
execute a full-wave mode conversion model for the signal-strength calculations. This version is principally composed 
of FORTRAN subroutines with a few additional routines written in C to implement the graphics capabilities under 
the Windows 95/NT operating systems.
