Introduction 


The purpose of the research reported here is to provide a rapid computational method for 
computing various statistical parameters associated with overlapped Hann spectra. These 
results are important for the Targeted Search part of the SETI Microwave Observing 
Project. 


Parameters, Tables, and Computer Runs 

Formulas to evaluate relevant statistical parameters for 50% overlapped Hann spectra have 
been derived. Details axe provided in the attached publication on Computational Problems 
and Signal Processing in SETI, ref. 1. High precision computer codes to implement the for- 
mulas, and thus compute the statistical parameters, have been written and tested. Three 
independent methods have been used as a cross-check to guard against programming mis- 
takes. The parameters of interest include m (the number of overlapped spectra computed), 
T u (the threshold), Pf a (the false alarm probability), Pd (the detection probability), and 
r (the signal-to-noise ratio). 

Given m and Pf a it is possible to compute the threshold T„, and then find the r that 
corresponds to a given Pd- This computation requires an enormous amount of computer 
time, in some cases 15 or 20 minutes on a VAX 8650. Consequently, the idea is to compute 
the parameters at several points over regions of interest, and use interpolation methods 
to obtain results at intermediate points. The tables produced by these rather extensive 
computations on the VAX 8650 have been published as a NASA Technical Memorandum, 
ref. 2. These tables cover false alarm rates from 10 -14 to 10 -1 and signal detection 
probabilities from 0.50 to 0.99 for the number of computed spectra ranging from 4 to 2000. 

An interactive computer program OHINTERP has been written using the C program- 
ming language to do the interpolations in three dimensions. Observe that when using the 
tables the parameters Pd, m, and Pf a can be regarded as representing the x, y, and z axes 
in a three-dimensional space. The program uses cubic interpolation and runs very fast, 
yielding output results as fast as one can enter the various input parameters. Four samples 
of interactive runs are included in Appendix A of this report. The first run simply repro-

duces what is in the table for Pj a — 10 -6 and no interpolation is required. The second 
run requires a single interpolation in that same table. The third run yields an interpolated 
result that made use of a two-dimensional interpolation. The fourth run makes full use of 
interpolation in all three dimensions. 

The accuracy of the interpolation in this three-dimensional space has been tested and 
found to be at least as good as one significant figure less than the computed values that 
appear in the tables. For this reason, interpolations generated by the computer program 
are rounded to three decimal places after doing the calculation to four decimal places. 


Summary 

A rapid computational method has been developed for computing statistical parameters 
associated with overlapped Hann spectra. Since accurate calculations to implement the 
formulas require such an enormous amount of computer time, tables are produced that 
cover regions of interest. By using the tables in conjunction with very fast interpolation 
procedures an interactive computer program can be used to obtain additional informa- 
tion. The results of this research are important for the Targeted Search part of the SETI 
Microwave Observing Project. 

Ongoing and Future Work 

The principal investigator has accepted an IPA assignment at NASA Ames Research Center 
for the 1991-92 academic year. During that time he will continue to work on various 
computational aspects of signal detection associated with SETI; work on editing a book of 
algorithms associated with SETI will continue. New work on algorithm development and 
analyses of reports from the CW Detector and the Pulse Detector will begin.
