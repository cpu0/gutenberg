AIPS++ is an Astronomical Information Processing System being designed and implemented by 
an international consortium of NRAO and six other radio astronomy institutions in Australia, 
India, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the USA. AIPS++ is intended to 
replace the functionality of AIPS, be more easily programmable, and will be implemented in 
C++ using object-oriented techniques. 

Programmability in AIPS++ is planned at three levels. The first level will be that of a 
command-line interpreter with characteristics similar to IDL and PV-Wave, but with an ex- 
tensive set of operations appropriate to telescope data handling, image formation, and image 
processing. The third level will be in C++ with extensive use of class libraries for both basic 
operations and advanced applications. The third level will allow input and output of data 
between external FORTRAN programs and AIPS++ telescope and image databases. 

In addition to summarizing the above programmability characteristics, this talk will give an 
overview of the classes currently being designed for telescope data calibration and editing, image 
formation, and the “toolkit” of mathematical “objects” that will perform most of the processing 
in AIPS++.
