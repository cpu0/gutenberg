ABSTRACT 

The work is devoted to the theoretical analysis of contact melting by the migrating heat source with 
an arbitrary shaped isothermal heating surface. After the substantiated simplification the governing equa- 
tions arc transformed to the convenient for engineering calculations relationships. Analytical solutions 
are used for numerical prediction of optimal shape of the heating surface. Problem is investigetcd for the 
constant and for temperature dependent physical properties of the melt. 

1. INTRODUCTION 

Melting of solids by contact with a heating surface takes place in numcro.iN natural and 
technological processes. These processes are enumerated in the previous works [2, 4, 12-14, 22] devoted 
to contact melting problem and are divided into two groups. In one group the melting material lies on the 
heating surface and pressed against it by some external force (for instance, the force of the weight of the 
melting material). This situation arises when an unfixed solid melts in an enclosure [1, 16, 22] and in other 
contact melting devices used in industry [8]. Another group of applications involves a moving heat source 
melting its way through the surrounding solid. This situation arises in such fields as welding [21], geology 
[3], nuclear technology [9, 10] thermal drilling of rocks [4, 6, 18, 20] and glaciers [11,17, 19]. Thermal dril- 
ling is commonly recognized now as the most effective method of boring glaciers. Boring rocks, sands and 
soil by thermopenctrators is a relatively new method in mining engineering. It has some advantages in 
comparison with traditional rotary drilling. The moii considerable advantage of thermodrilling is that 
three major facts of excavation (rock fracturing, debris removal and wall stabilization) are accomplished 
in a single integrated operation. 

This work is devoted to the theoretical analysis of the contact melting process by the moving heating 
source with an arbitrary shaped isothermal heating surface. 

2. ANALYSIS 

2.1. The physical model and govcrnin}; equations. 

Obviously every technological process where contact melting occurs has its own specific character. In 
particular case of thermodrilling. it is contact melting with a great specific load and heal energy, wiih ar- 
bitrary shaped heating surface. Thermopenctrators are radially symmetric and in some cases ring-shaped, J

[or toroidal, with a large central hole for forming and extracting the core sample [6]. A schematic diagram] 
of the contact melting for the thermodrilling conditions is shown m Fig.l. Axisymmctric heater -1 is pen- 
etrating into the melting solid -2 with the velocity V under the effect of applied external force F. The 
Ihcrmopcnctrator is separated from the solid with a layer of melt -3, flowing along the thin channel be- 
tween the heating surface I , and solid-liquid interface I ^. It is assumed that the solid-liquid interface 
IS a sharply defmed surface and melting occurs precisely at temperature t^, melt flow is laminar and 
two-dimensional. Molten layer is assumed to be incompressible Newtonian liquid with a temperature de- 
pendent physical properties (except density). Experimental results [6, 15] indicated that the heat source ve- 
locity attains its quasi-steady, constant value V soon after mitiation of melting. This fact justifies the next 
assumption of quasi-steady heat and mass transfer in the contact melting problem. 

According to the physical model and assumptions enumerated above the governing differential equa- 
tions of heat and mass transfer in the molten layer can be written as follows: 

divy = 

pjv' V)y = G-p^Vp-fdivT 

C^pjjy- VtJ = div(;.j^VtJ + <I. (,) 

where T is the dcviator part of the tensor of internal stresses; v, p, t^ are the liquids velocity, pressure 
and temperature respectively; O represents the dissipative terms in heat transfer equation; C^, p^, ;., liq. 
uid properties defined in Nomenclature; the rest of the symbols arc standard. 

It is convenient for further analysis to use two systems of coordmatcs fixed to the holing surface: cy- 
lindrical coordinates (r, z) and local orthogonal boundary layer coordinates S and ^ are inJicated in Fig. 1. 

Transforming (1) to non-dimensional form and using the similarity method in a preliminary analysis 
the main dimcnsionlcss parameters and numbers arc generated [7]: 

Pe--. Ste = . K, = ^-L-^j .K^=-^. Re = Vp.d/.: ^. 

WP _ PcK.K, ;. 

^'^C% (t -t )■ ^^ = -K^' *^^=Ti-. K, = p^gd/W (2) 

All the quantities here arc defined in the Nomenclature. Each of the dimcnsionlcss numbers (2) has 
an exact obvious physical meaning. In order to substantiate the simplification of the governing equations 
(1), the analysis of the values of these non-dimen.ional numbers for the concrete conditions of thermal 
drUling of ice and rock was carried out. Dimcnsionlcss parameter K^- 10"'- lO"' physically represents 
the ratio of characteristic thickness of the molten layer and characteristic size of the heating surface d; cri- 
terion Kg- 10-^ is the ratio of the characteristic mass force of the melt and external force; Reynolds 
number Re- lO"*- lO''; Brinkman number Br~ 10"'- 10"^ represents the viscous dissipation of heat m 
the molten layer, Pecklet number Pe~ 10—100; Stefan number Ste~ I— 10; K^, K,~ 1. 

After neglecting terms of 0(K„ K,, Re. Br) the governing nond.mcnsional equations of heat and 
mass transfer in the molten layer will take the following form:

Equations (23), (24), (27)-(31) simulate heat and mass transfer processes in contact melting problem 
with the accuracy of OCK^). They arc convenient for prediction of contact melting process for materials 
with variable physical properties such as different kinds of rocks and sands. 

When the physical properties of melt arc constant (for example in the case of ice melting) equations 
(17), (23), (24), (27), (28), (30), (31). allows the considerable simplification.

3. RESULTS 

Numerical prediction of u„ u,, P, H, 0, /? and other quantities of interest is carried out for ice and 
rock thcrmodrilling conditions. All the calculations of rock melting arc based on equations (23), (24), (27) 
— (31). Relatively complete description of basalt physical properties at high temperature is available in [5, 
6]. Non-linear equation (27) is solved numerically by the iteration procedure. After this other quantities 
are obtained automatically in a view of equations (23), (24), (28)— (31). As the initial estimate of iterative 
process solution (35) is chosen. When the ice boring process is investigated formulae (29), (32)— (37) are 
used. The values of ice physical properties one can find for example in [4, 17, 19]. Effectiveness of the 
[heating surface is estimated by the value of parameter f! Tt is shown in previous works [4, 17] that in com- J

Fparison with the other (cone-shaped, sphere-shaped, etc.) thermopenclrators of the same power output | 
the parabolic shaped pcnetrator attains the highest melting velocity, Therefore present paper is devoted to 
more detail analysis of contact melting with parabolic heating surface. The elongation of the s.irfacc is 
characterized by the value of shape parameter A. The results of numerically predicted efficiency as a func- 
tion of A for different conditions of ice and rock melting arc plotted in Fig. 2. Numerical results indicates 
that for slow melting when heat transfer in the molten layer is of minor significance and in the contrary 
the heat dissipation increases the flat heating surface (A< 1) is more cffccfivc. Vice versa for high speed 
melting the heat energy rate in the melt is dominating in comparison with the dissipation in surrounding 
solid material. So in this case the elongate form of heating surface is preferable. According the calcula- 
tions presented in Fig. 2 there is the interval for melting velocities when the definition of the optimal shape 
is not trivial. For toroidal pcnetrator (v = 0)and ice melting conditions 20 < Pe< 55; for non— coring 
pcnetrator (v= 1) and rock melting conditions 40< Pc< 75. In order to find the maximum of P and the 
corresponding value of A, the derivative of /? with respect to A is calculated. When the problem is 
non-linear and the physical properties of the melt depend on temperature the derivative is calculated 
numerically; when n, c, / arc constants it is feasible to calculate P\ analytically. In a view of relationship 
(37) the equation /?\ = for computation of the optimal A can be written as follows; — PcH'^E — E'^ 
= 0. 

This simple equation is solved by dividing segment in half method.
