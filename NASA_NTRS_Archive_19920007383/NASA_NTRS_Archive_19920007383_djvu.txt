ABSTRACT This paper describes a diagnostic expert system to improve the quality of Naval 
Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) construction drawings and specification. CLIPS 
and CAD layering standards are used in an expert system to check and coordinate construction 
drawings and specifications to eliminate errors and omissions. 


INTRODUCTION 

Designing and constructing naval shore facilities for the United States Navy is a complex 
process. The quality of construction documents is a major factor in this process. The review 
and coordination of construction drawings and specifications is one of the critical tasks performed 
by NAVFAC architects and engineers. Defective drawings and specifications can lead to change 
orders, time delays, and litigation. 

Experience has shown that more than half of the errors and omissions found in 
construction drawings and specifications result from inadequate coordination between architec- 
tural and engineering disciplines (Nigro, 1984). A recent study by the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers found that more than 95 percent of all review comments addressed coordination issues 
(Kirby, 1989). 

In response to the problem, NAVFAC implemented a quality assurance program in 
April of 1986. An interdisciplinary coordination review checklist was developed to check 
for in-consistencies, interferences, errors and omissions, both technically and graphically, that 
may exist in or between disciplines. A recent survey by Charles Markert, NAVFAC’s Deputy 
Assistant Commander for Engineering and Design found that NAVFAC has discovered signifi- 
cant benefits from conducting interdisciplinary coordination checks at the final design stage of 
projects (DCQI, 1990). 

The NAVFAC interdisciplinary coordination checklist contains over 500 review items. 
The checklist, when used conscientiously, can eliminate many of the design deficiencies which 
have occurred in past construction projects. Current procedures calls for each checklist item to 
be analyzed for applicability to the project’s drawing and specification content. This is 
accomplished by manually reviewing the drawings and specifications with the checklist. If 
an item is found not applicable, the letters “NA” will be inserted adjacent to the checklist item. 
The remaining checklist items are used to perform the interdisciplinary coordination review.

THE PROBLEM 


The development and application of quality control coordination checklists is a step in the 
right direction, but does not provide a production oriented soludon to the problem. Often 
checklists contain several hundred items which may not be applicable to the drawing and 
specification content. Typically, due to quantity and nonapplicability, checklist items are often 
ignored during the review process. The process of edidng, comparing, and coordinating 
checklist items with the drawings and specificadons is time consuming considering it is not 
unusual for project drawings to exceed 50 sheets. Checklist editing also assumes a level of 
experience the reviewer may not possess and may well result in the non-prioritizing of the issues 
being checked. 

The majority of NAVFAC’s construction drawings are produced using manual drawing 
procedures, but this is rapidly changing. NAVFAC as well as architectural/engineering firms 
under contract to NAVFAC have made heavy investments in computer-aided design (CAD) 
hardware and software. Receiving construction drawings delivered in a CAD format is becoming 
common. Despite the self-coordinating aspects of CAD drawings, coordination and omission 
errors can still arise. No matter what process (manual drafting, systems drafting or CAD) is used 
to produce a set of construction drawings, all drawings need to be checked (Duggar, 1984). 


OBJECTIVE 

The objective of this project is to produce an easy-to-use, automated, expert system, capable of 
quickly analyzing project data (drawing and specification content), recognize potential 
coordination issues, establish review priorities and provide quality control guidance specific 
to the project being reviewed. The expert system must function as an intelligent assistant which 
provides the user with knowledge (advice) based on expen experience and lessons learned 
from past projects with similar drawing content. 


SOLUTION 

The solution to the problem of automating the quality review of construction drawings and 
specifications is to develop a rule-based diagnostic expert system capable of reading the drawing 
contents of CAD drawing database files. The C Language Integrated Production System 
(CLIPS) was selected as the expert system shell and AutoCad software running in conjunction 
with the CadPLUS Total Architectural/Engineering software was selected to produce the CAD 
drawings. 

The CAD Data Base 

The CadPLUS Total Architectural/Engineering System is a powerful facility design tool 
developed by the Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory and CadPLUS Products Company 
of Albuquerque, NM under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement. The 


358 


software runs in conjunction with AutoCad and implements the CAD Layering Guidelines 
published by the American Institute of Architects (AIA). 

In order to insure reusability of CAD drawings during a facility’s life cycle, NAVFAC 
has adopted a standard approach for the use of CAD layers. Layering is “the basic method most 
CAD systems use to group information for display, editing, and plotting purposes” (Schley, 
1990a). NAVFAC along with the American Institute of Architects, the American Consulting 
Engineers Council, the American Society of Civil Engineers, International Facility Management 
Association, United States Army Corp of Engineers and the Department of Veterans Affairs 
sponsored the development of a standard approach for the use and naming of CAD layers. 

It was not the intention of the CAD Layering Guidelines to attempt to use layers to carry 
“drawing intelligence” (Schley, 1990a), however the CAD Layering Guideline’s structure 
and format, see Figures 1 through 5, provide a detailed description of a project’s drawing 
content. Drawing content is the key to determining the applicability of interdisciplinary 
coordination checklist items.

CLIPS Expert System Shell 


CLIPS is a forward chaining rule-based expert system shell, “designed at NASA/Johnson Space 
Center with the specific purpose of providing high portability, low cost and easy integration with 
external systems” (Giarratano 1989a). The three major components of the CLIPS expert system 
shown in Figure 6 are: 


1. Fact-list: global memory for data 

2. Knowledge-base: contains all the rules 

3. Inference engine: controls overall execution 

“In order to solve a problem, the CLIPS program must have data or information with 
which it can reason. A chunk of information in CLIPS is called a fact” (Giarratano 1989b). The 
programs fact-list is a product of the CAD drawing database. A LISP program within the CAD 
system is used to generate an ASCII file (layer.dat) listing all layers present within the CAD 
graphic database. The CLIPS load-facts function is used to input the facts into the program. 
The following are examples of facts : 


Fact List 


Description

(a-prof) 

(s-psfr) 

(p-strm-rfdr) 

(e-prof) 


Architectural wall, new 
Roof Plan 

Structural Framing Plan 
Roof Drain 
Electrical Roof Plan 


A rule is the method that CLIPS uses to represent knowledge. An example of a possible rule for 
checking drawing coordination is: 


IF the project drawings contain a Roof Plan and Roof Framing Plan. 
THEN coordinate the Roof Plan with the Roof Framing Plan and verify 
direction of roof slope. 


The rule expressed in CLIPS format would appear as: 

(defrule coordinate-roof-plan-and-roof-framing-plan 
(a-prof) 

(s-psfr) 

=> 

(fprintout t “Coordinate the Roof Plan with the Roof Framing 
Plan” crlf) 

(fprintout t “Verify direction of the roof slope.” 
crlf))

COMMENTS TO A/E 


Figure 6. Prototype work model. 


The knowledge-base rules are a product of the existing NAVFAC interdisciplinary 
coordination checklist and REDICHECK. REDICHECK, which was developed by LCDR 
William T. Nigro, CEC, USN (Ret) is a structured coordination review system that is also 
implemented by using a manual checklist. 

The CLIPS inference engine makes inferences by deciding if a rule is satisfied by the facts. 
For example, if a project under review contained a Roof Plan (layer a-prof) and a Framing Plan 
(layer s-psfr), then pattern matching would occur in the previously defined defrule and the 
knowledge-base would consider the review comment as applicable. In this application, the CLIPS 
knowledge-base consists of rules that when activated by matching facts, outputs a project-specific 
quality control coordination checklist 

The rules required to generate a project-specific checklist are embedded in the CLIPS 
program. In order to reduce the size of the program, the master checklist items are stored outside 
the program and accessed by the CLIPS read function.

CLIPS also has a feature to control the execution of rules called salience. Salience values 
are used to order the rules in terms of increasing priority and will activate rules to assemble a 
prioritized project specific checklist 


FUTURE WORK 

To date, much progress has been made in understanding the problem domain and 
developing the knowledge-base. Future development plans include: 

1. Development of a menu driven interface. 

2. Development of rules that identify omissions, duplications, and inconsistencies 
between reference/identification symbols (detail bubbles, door reference symbols, 
equipment numbers, etc.) and details, sections, and schedules. 

3. Development of rules that identify omissions, duplication, and inconsistencies 
between labels/keynotes and project specifications. 

4. Development of an interface between the CAD geometric data base and the CLIPS 
knowledge-base. 


CONCLUSIONS 

At a recent Naval Sea Systems Command conference. Admiral Frank B. Kelso, II, Chief of Naval 
Operations commented that we have “to learn to do things more efficiently; with better quality 
than we had in the past.” In this application, CLIPS provides NAVFAC with a powerful tool 
to improve the total quality management of the construction document review process.
