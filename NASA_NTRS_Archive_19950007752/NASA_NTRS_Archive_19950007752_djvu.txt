Ada 9X Overview / _ ^ 

ABSTRACT / <j / 0 ,, ^ 

The current version of Ada has been an ANSI standard since 1983. In 1988, 
the Ada Joint Program Office was tasked with reevaluating the language and 
proposing changes to the standard. Since that time, the world has seen a tre- 
mendous explosion in object-oriented languages, as well as other growing 
fields such as distributed computing and support for very large software sys- 
tems. Mr. Weller will discuss the new features being added to the next version 
of Ada, currently called Ada9X, and what transition issues must be considered 
for current Ada projects. The presentation assumes a familiarity with the fea- 
tures of the current Ada programming language. 


BIOGRAPHY 

Mr. Weller is a senior systems engineer with CAE-Link, Space Technology 
Division. He is the project leader of the Software Engineering Group, which is 
responsible for the definition of the software architecture and development 
methodology for both the Space Station and Space Shuttle Training Systems. 
Mr. Weller has been working with Ada since 1985, and is currently an official 
reviewer of the Ada 9X language. Mr. Weller was previously in the Air Force
