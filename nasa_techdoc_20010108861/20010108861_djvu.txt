Abstract â€” A fast computational method based on differential 
equation approach for inverse DOK model has been extended for the 
inverse CMH model. Also, a cobweb technique for calculating the 
inverse CMH model is also presented. The two techniques are differed 
from the point of view of flexibility and computation time. 


INTRODUCTION 


The CMH model is a moving Preisach model in which the 
reversible component of the magnetization is state-dependent. 
Unlike the DOK model, it accurately predicts the variation in 
zero-field susceptibility with magnetization. It has not been 
used much in the past because the DOK model, which is 
much easier to calculate, is accurate enough in most cases to 
describe the magnetization process and a fast simple 
algorithm was not available. 

Two fast techniques based on the differential equation 
method and the cobweb method for calculating the CN4H 
model have been presented in [1]. The speed increase of the 
two techniques results from computing the magnetization by 
simply adding the change in magnetization due to any change 
in applied field to the previously computed magnetization, 
instead of integrating over the Preisach plane at each step of 
the computation. 

Ferromagnetic actuators are used for active control in 
many automotive, industrial, and aerospace applications. 
Peizoceramic, Shape memory alloy, and Terfenol-D are more 
widely used ferromagnetic materials, even though they 
display the hysteretic behaviour at large drive levels. For high 
accuracy or micropositioning applications, an accurate 
compensator based controller can improve the performance of 
ferromagnetic actuators [2-4]. The fast inverse CMH model 
based computational methods presented here could be used to 
compensate the hysteretic effects.

The signal flow for an inverse CMH model is shown in Fig.

The CMH model is implemented based on the cobweb 
grid systems for irreversible magnetization and a+ and a. 
variables for the reversible magnetization [1]. A detailed 
algorithm for inverse CMH model using cobweb approach is 
developed. Details of the algorithm will be presented in the 
final paper.

computation time and flexibility.
