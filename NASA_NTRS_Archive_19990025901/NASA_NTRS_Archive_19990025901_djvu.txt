Dear Mr. Hueter, 

Attached are the final report materials for NASA Grant NAG8-1302 entitled “Launch 
Vehicle Systems Analysis’" that was conducted by the Space Systems Design Laboratory (SSDL) at 
the Georgia Institute of Technology during the period June 3, 1996 to September 30, 1998. The 
final report includes a summary of grant activities, copies of technical papers written during this 
grant, and presentation-style charts highlighting major grant activities. 

In addition to providing generic RBCC design tool and process support to MSFC’s 
Preliminary Design office (PD), our research under this grant was divided into four main topics. 
First, we have developed a new performance analysis tool for Rocket-Based Combined-Cycle 
engines. The new tool is called SCCREAM, and it is available to users on the World Wide Web. 
Second, we have conducted an independent Vision Vehicle design exercise to evaluate ejector 
scramjet RBCC propulsion for advanced HTHL launch vehicles. Our vehicle design is called 
Hyperion. Third, we actively supported Marshall’s Bantam-X program to explore low cost, low 
payload launch vehicle designs. Georgia Tech developed and evaluated two RBCC concepts for 
Bantam-X - Stargazer and Bantam Argus. Lastly, we supported MSFC’s Mars Exploration team 
during the summer of 1998 by evaluating several interplanetary trajectory options for a potential 
human mission. 

I would like to thank you for your continued support of our research and educational 
activities in advanced space transportation system design. Partly with the support of this grant, the 
Space Systems Design Lab has grown from only 2 graduate students in 1996 to a more fully 
developed and capable research lab of 1 1 graduate students in 1998. Thanks to its sponsors, SSDL 
is becoming a unique resource for training students in the tools and methods of advanced vehicle 
design. We look forward to working with you and your organization on future projects. 

Sincerely, 

V-JUiK Gj&l

Final Summary of Grant Activities 
Launch Vehicle Systems Analysis 

Grant NAG8 -1302, NASA - Marshall Space Flight Center 

For the period June 3, 1996 - September 30, 1998 


Grant Background: 

This report summaries the key accomplishments of Georgia Tech’s Space Systems Design 
Laboratory (SSDL) under NASA Grant NAG8-1302 from NASA - Marshall Space Flight Center. 
The report consists of this summary white paper, copies of technical papers written under this 
grant, and several viewgraph-style presentations. The period of performance of this grant was June 
3, 1996 to September 30, 1998. 


Summary of Grant Accomplishments: 

During the course of this grant, there were four main tasks completed by the PI and student 
members of the SSDL. These tasks were, 

1) SCCREAM - A new computer analysis tool for predicting the performance of various 
RBCC engine configurations was originally developed and later improved under this grant. 
SCCREAM (Simulated Combined-Cycle Rocket Engine Analysis Module) is an object- 
oriented code written in C++. Version 5 (the latest version) is also accessible from the web 
at http://atlas.cad.gatech.edu/~jebradfo. SCCREAM is capable of quickly predicting thrust 
and Isp of a given RBCC engine configuration over a range of flight conditions and engine 
operating modes (ejector, ramjet, fan-ramjet, etc.). Unlike other airbreathing engine codes, 
SCCREAM is uniquely suited for use in a conceptual vehicle design environment — 
particularly where POST is used to perform trajectory optimization. This work was carried 
out by John Bradford, a graduate student in SSDL, from September 1996 to September 
1998. He plans to continue improving SCCREAM and adding new capabilities under a 
NASA GSRP Fellowship that started in September 1998. SCCREAM is currently being 
used by NASA - MSFC personnel in PD and EP (George Kearns and D. R. Komar). 
Copies of SCCREAM technical papers are included as attachments to this report. 

2) Hyperion - In support of its RBCC ground test program, NASA’s ARTT office also 
solicited advanced launch vehicle designs from the various ARTT engine contractor teams. 
These RBCC Vision Vehicles were to be single-stage LOX/LH2 vehicles capable of

jro/1.99/1 



delivering 25,000 lb. payloads to the International Space Station orbit. Under this grant, 
Georgia Tech developed and refined an RBCC SSTO vehicle design based partially on the 
Vision Vehicle requirements. The Georgia Tech design is called Hyperion. It is a horizontal 
take-off, horizontal landing vehicle powered by 5 RBCC ejector scramjet engines. A set of 
ducted fans is also included for powered landing and loiter operations. Two versions of 
Hyperion were investigated — a baseline version capable of delivering 1 1 ,000 lb. to Space 
Station, and a Vision Vehicle version capable of delivering 25,000 lb. to Space Station. 
Both designs used non-proprietary tools and databases and the results were made available 
in the open literature. The Hyperion design was analyzed and refined over the period of this 
grant by a team of several graduate students in SSDL lead by John Bradford. Team skills 
and disciplines included aerodynamics, propulsion, trajectory optimization, mass 
properties, operations, configuration and packaging, cost analysis, and business 
simulation. The latest results from the Hyperion design are included as attachments to this 
report. Other grant-supported presentations made on Hyperion or RBCC Vision Vehicle 
mission requirements are also attached. 

3) Bantam-X Supp ort - In the late spring of 1998, a $25k supplement was added to this grant 
for an SSDL design team to address Bantam-X vehicle configurations. Bantam is a small 
payload mission (about 300 lb. to LEO) with a very aggressive launch price goal of less 
than $1M - $1.5M per launch. A team of several Georgia Tech students and the PI worked 
with NASA MSFC personnel (primarily D. R. Komar of EP) to develop a Bantam-class 
TSTO launch vehicle design called Stargazer. Stargazer uses a wedge shaped, reusable, 
flyback booster powered by 4 LOX/LH2 ejector scramjet RBCC engines and a LOX/RP 
expendable upper stage (with a Fastrac -derived engine). The Georgia Tech team performed 
a conceptual assessment of Stargazer including weig it, performance, and cost. A second 
concept, Bantam Argus, was also briefly evaluated. The preliminary results for both 
designs are included as an attachment to this report. In addition, this grant supplement 
sponsored a summer internship at MSFC for Laura Ledsinger, a graduate student in SSDL. 
While at MSFC the summer of 1998, Ms. Ledsinger continued to make refinements to the 
Stargazer concept and provided various forms of trajectory support to PD and EP. A copy 
of Laura Ledsinger’ s summer research results are atta:hed. She currently serves as the team 
leader for on-going Stargazer trade studies being coneucted under a new NASA grant. 

4) Interplanetary Trajectory Supp ort - A second grant supplement in the amount of $6k was 
added in the summer of 1998 to support trajectory analysis for interplanetary human Mars 
missions being conducted by MSFC’s Exploration office. This supplement supported a 
summer internship for Tara Poston, an undergraduate student in SSDL. Ms. Poston 
worked primarily with Larry Kos in PD evaluating various trajectory options and 
opportunities for Human Mars missions (e.g. departure dates, stay times, aerobrake vs. 
propulsion capture, and preliminary launch vehicle stack sizing). A summary presentation 
of Ms. Poston’s summer research activities is included as an attachment.

Secondary Goal - Knowledge Transfer: 

When initiated, one of the secondary purposes of this grant was to increase the cooperation 
between MSFC’s advanced space vehicle design organizations (primarily the Preliminary Design 
office and some elements of the Advanced Space Transportation Program office) and Georgia 
Tech’s Space Systems Design Lab. As the grant continued, this underlying cooperation was 
developed and maintained in the form of information exchange, design tool development, and “on- 
site” residency of the Georgia Tech PI at NASA during parts of the summers of 1997 and 1998. 
Also, the PI and the students in the SSDL at Georgia Tech often served as a remote resource for 
Preliminary Design (PD) in areas specifically related to RBCC launch vehicle design. SSDL has 
performed several conceptual RBCC launch vehicle designs using tools similar to those available to 
engineers in PD, and the NASA COTR had hoped by that SSDL would help to build a new 
capability to analyze and design RBCC launch vehicles within PD. 

While good working relationships have developed between both organizations, actual 
transfer of RBCC vehicle design capabilities has not been entirely successful. At the end of this 
grant, it is still not clear that NASA MSFC has the capability to fully perform a complete 
conceptual design of an RBCC launch vehicle. The tools and computer resources are in place to do 
so (most were existing already, only GT’s new SCCREAM and CABAM tools were added to the 
toolset). What then is the reason for lack of success in this area? While it is not the purpose of this 
report to recommend possible solutions to NASA, three areas are highlighted that, in the opinion of 
the PI, are keys to any successful design organization. 

1) Management - A successful design organization depends on quality technical management. 
Management must provide motivation for the team, establish expectations of performance 
and schedule, monitor the team’s progress, and initiate corrections as needed. In particular, 
management is responsible for assembling a team of personnel capable and willing to 
perform a given design task. Management must also establish a clear reward system based 
upon each employee’s performance in the design environment. As a particular suggestion 
in this case, NASA management should also move to more fully integrate cost analysis into 
PD advanced design projects. 

2) Lead Engineers/Svstems Engineers - Lead engineers are the most critical component of a 
design team. They manage the flow of information between members of a team, set 
schedules, call meetings, and provide technical decision making. Lead engineers are 
knowledgeable of all of the individual disciplines within a process (cross-trained) and fully 
understand the data flow between them. They have considerable design experience and are 
typically promoted from within an organization. A good design organization will have 3-4 
lead engineers so that more than one design project can be conducted simultaneously. PD 


NAG8-1302 Summary of Activities 


jro/1 .99/3 



currently has a lack of lead engineers and a lack of disciplinary engineers even willing to 
serve as a lead engineer, partly because there is no organizational-level reward to 
progressing into that position. Also, previous lead engineers have often been given 
responsibility for a given project, without also being given the authority to manage his or 
her team members. A formal, continuous training program for lead engineers would also be 
beneficial. 


3) Disciplinary Skills - Most design organizations will be at least “two deep” in every 
discipline. PD buyouts, retirements, and transfers have left its advanced design 
organization without trained, motivated personnel in several of the key engineering 
disciplines required to conduct a conceptual RBCC vehicle design. MSFC often asks its 
most motivated young engineers to handle two or three disciplines in an effort to cover the 
design space. Necessary computing tools are either in place or easily obtained. PD should 
be allowed to recruit new personnel to its advanced design organization. RBCC 
propulsion, aerodynamics, configuration, and mass properties are in particular need of 
additional depth. 


Students Supported: 

During the period of this grant, three Georgia Tech graduate students were directly supported 
with graduate research assistantship (GRA) monthly stipends and tuition reimbursement. An 
undergraduate student was also partially supported. 

1) John E. Bradford (graduate student, GRA supported from 9/96 - 6/98) 

2) Laura A. Ledsinger (graduate student, GRA, supported from 6/98 - 9/98) 

3) Jeffery A. Scott (graduate student, GRA, supported from 6/98 - 9/98) 

4) Tara Poston (undergraduate student, supported 6/98 - 8/98) 

John Bradford was supported by the original grant. Laura Ledsinger and Jeff Scott were part 
of the Bantam-X Stargazer team and were supported by the Bantam-X grant supplement. Tara 
Poston was supported during her 1998 summer internship by the Exploration grant supplement. 


Degrees Awarded: 

One advanced degree was awarded during the period of this grant based partially on research 
work performed on tasks outlined above.

jro/ 1.99/4 



1) John E. Bradford, Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering, December 1997. 

After earning his MS AE in December of 1997, Mr. Bradford is continuing his research on 
SCCREAM and is currently a Ph.D. student in AE at Georgia Tech. He has been supported by a 
NASA GRSP Fellowship since September of 1998. Jeff Scott, who was supported by this grant 
for several months during the summer of 1998 as part of the Stargazer team, earned an MS in AE 
in December 1998 (just after the grant concluded). 


Travel & Summer Activities: 

The following travel was taken in support of activities related to this grant. 

1) Dr. John Olds spent four weeks at NASA MSFC during the summer of 1997. This time 
was spent working with PD (primarily Steincamp, Brady, and Panned) to improve the 
RBCC design process, understand tools, review PD designs, etc. 

2) John Bradford spent eight weeks at NASA MSFC during the summer of 1997 working on 
SCCREAM and conducting Hyperion trade studies. During this time he worked with Bill 
Panned in PD and was supported by the NASA Academy program. 

3) Dr. John Olds and John Bradford attended the 37 th AIAA Joint Propulsion Conference in 
Seattle, WA in July 1997 to present a technical paper on SCCREAM (AIAA 97-2760).

RBCC Workshop and Review held at UAH in Huntsville, February 1998. 

5) Dr. John Olds spent fours weeks at NASA MSFC during the summer of 1998. Part of this 
time was spent working with engineers in PD (Swalley), and part of the time was spent in 
AST. The primary goal was to improve PD’s RBCC design process and provide assistance 
as necessary with design tools. 

6) Laura Ledsinger spent eight weeks at NASA MSFC on an internship during the summer of 
1998. She worked primarily with PD (Swalley), but also worked closely with D. R. 
Komar from EP. Her primary task was to continue Stargazer trade studies and assess 
branching trajectories. 

7) Tara Poston spent nine weeks on an undergraduate internship at NASA MSFC during the 
summer of 1998. She conducted trajectory analyses for PD’s Exploration team (Kos). 

8) Dr. John Olds and John Bradford attended the 38 ,h AIAA Joint Propulsion Conference in 
Cleveland, OH in July 1998 to present a technical paper on SCCREAM improvements 
(AIAA 98-3775).

Improvements and Enhancements to SCCREAM, A Conceptual RBCC 

Engine Analysis Tool

ABSTRACT 

A rocket based combined-cycle engine analysis 
tool suitable for use in the conceptual design 
environment has recently been established. While this 
tool was being used in the design environment, new 
analysis capabilities were desired and areas for 
improvement were noted. 

This paper will detail the recent improvements 
made to the conceptual design tool, SCCREAM, and 
present the results generated by the added capabilities. 
The improvements range from an additional engine 
analysis mode, alternate propellant combinations, and 
a new user-interface which enables remote execution. 

The improvements and added capabilities to 
SCCREAM will be discussed and the program 
methodology will be examined in detail when 
appropriate. Results generated by SCCREAM ’s new 
scramjet analysis mode are then shown to compare 
very well with an industry standard code, RJPA. 
Engine performance generated by SCCREAM for a 
single stage to orbit launch vehicle are then compared 
with historical airbreathing engine performance data, 
and other industry common analysis codes.

RBCC BACKGROUND 

Rocket Based Combined-Cycle (RBCC) represents 
a new approach for providing routine access to space. 
By integrating the elements of rocketry and air- 
breathing systems into a single unit, RBCC tries to 
exploit the best qualities of each. The rocket primary 
is used for providing the high level of thrust required at 



takeoff conditions and for acceleration until ramjet 
takeover speeds can be obtained. Once ramjet 
operation is feasible, the rocket primary is shut off to 
conserve fuel. The airbreathing modes of ramjet and 
scramjet are then used to accelerate the vehicle through 
the portions of the atmosphere where free oxygen is 
available. As the vehicle climbs and increases its 
speed, a point will be reached at which the ramjet or 
scramjet is no longer providing enough thrust to 
sufficiently accelerate the vehicle. For single stage to 
orbit (SS TO) configurations, it is at this point that the 
rocket primary is re-ignited and the vehicle proceeds 
directly to orbit. 

RBCC is not a new concept. Originating in the 
1960’s, a variety of basic concepts were developed 
considerably under a joint effort by the Marquaidt 
Corporation, U.S. Air Force, and Lockheed 1 . Due to 
budget constraints at the time and technical challenges 
required for full implementation, RBCC quickly fell to 
the sidelines, and the less complex rocket engine 
received full attention for space applications. 

During the 1980’s, significant gains were made in 
the area of airbreathing propulsion. The National 
Aerospace Plane program, or NASP, made major 
technological gains for airbreathing systems. NASP 
identified the major difficulties associated with this 
form of propulsion and many new technologies in the 
areas of thermal protection, inlet design, and 
supersonic combustion were enabled. Despite the 
technology advances, the unbelievable and 
overwhelming task of airbreathing to speeds above 
Mach 15 prevented a feasible vehicle design from 
being obtained. 

It has been only recently that interest has been 
renewed in RBCC systems. By merging two 
previously independent systems, RBCC can offer a 
number of advantages for launch vehicle designers. In 
terms of engine performance, RBCC offers higher 
trajectory averaged specific impulse (1^) than pure 
rocket engines, and higher engine thrust-to-weight 
ratios than pure airbreathing engines. But, these gains 
come at the expense of a higher vehicle dry weight and 
increased vehicle complexity. The real advantage from 
RBCC is in the high flight rates and mission 
flexibility that these engines enable. RBCC is 
suitable for missions that include: earth-to-orbit, pop- 


up trajectory maneuvers, and high speed point-to-point 
missions. RBCC also promises increased loiter and 
abort options. These capabilities will be required on 
future space transportation systems. 

A number of very attractive vehicle concepts for 
future launch systems have already been designed 2 . 
Many of the most promising of these concepts utilize 
RBCC propulsion, and the feasibility of these systems 
is almost unquestioned. The primary challenge now is 
in designing an economically viable system. With 
total program development costs ranging in the 
billions of dollars, robust designs that ensure success 
are mandatory. 

RBCC propulsion appears to have a very 
promising future, and may provide the key to 
affordable, routine, and safe access to space. 

PREVIOUS RESEARCH 

Engineers in a conceptual RBCC launch vehicle 
design environment needed to be able to assess engine 
performance at each point in the ascent trajectory. That 
is, for a given altitude, flight velocity, and engine 
operating mode, what thrust and I sp are produced by the 
engine? This data is typically used in a trajectory 
optimization code to determine a minimum fuel flight 
path to orbit. 

Due tc computing speed limitations, the required 
engine data is commonly generated off-line for a range 
of expected altitudes and flight speeds. The resultant 
database is formatted into a tabular form. Data is 
interpolated from the tables as needed by the trajectory 
optimizaticn code. 

The cirrent engine analysis tool, SCCREAM, is 
a descendait of tools generated under earlier research 
efforts 3 . SCCREAM (Simulated Combined-Cycle 
Rocket Engine Analysis Module), is an object-oriented 
code written in C++. The code executes on a UNIX 
workstation, runs a full range of flight conditions and 
engine modes in under 60 seconds, and will output a 
properly formatted POST 4 engine table. SCCREAM 
is not intended to be a high-fidelity propulsion tool 
suitable fr r analyzing a particular RBCC engine 
concept in great detail, although its results compare 


- 2 - 



very well with those generated from more detailed 
codes. It was created to be a conceptual design tool 
capable of quickly generating a large number of 
reasonably accurate engine performance data points in 
support of early launch vehicle design studies. 


SCCREAM OVERVIEW 

SCCREAM has the capability to model the 
performance of four types of RBCC engines. One is 
the configuration identified in the Marquardt study 
— the supercharged ejector ramjet (SERJ). The other 
three are the (non-supercharged) ejector ramjet (ERJ), 
the ejector scramjet (ESJ), and the supercharged ejector 
scramjet (SESJ). Additionally, SCCREAM can model 
pure ramjet and pure scramjet configurations. 

SCCREAM operates by solving for the fluid flow 
properties (velocity, temperature, pressure, mass flow 
rate, gamma, specific heat capacity, etc.) through the 
various engine stations for each of the engine 
operating modes. Equations for conservation of mass, 
momentum, and energy are used. This process is often 
iterative at a given engine station or between a 
downstream and an upstream station. The flow 
properties are calculated using quasi- ID flow 
equations. Engine cross-sectional area is the only 
geometry variable along the stream direction. 
Component efficiencies are used to simulate losses of 
total pressure in the mixer and nozzle, and reduced 
enthalpy in both the rocket primary and main 
combustor. The inlet is simulated by a simple total 
pressure recovery schedule. Thrust and 1^ are 
determined using a control volume analysis of the 
entering and exiting fluid momentum and the static 
pressures at the inlet and exit planes. 

Most internal areas in SCCREAM are determined 
based on ratios to the inlet/cowl cross-sectional area. 
Default area ratios are supplied, so typically a user 
enters only the inlet area. The size of the rocket 
primary unit is primarily based on a user-entered 
propellant mass flow rate for the rocket primary. These 
two independent variables can be varied to produce an 
engine with a desired sea-level static thrust and 
secondary-to-primary mass flow ratio. In practice, 
however, the inlet area is often limited by overall 
vehicle geometry or shock-on-lip conditions. 


Optionally, the user can enter a desired sea-level static 
thrust and inlet area, and SCCREAM will iterate to 
determine the primary mass flow rate required. 

In order to generate a POST engine table, a 
candidate engine’s performance is evaluated over a 
range of altitudes and Mach numbers. These Mach 
number and altitude ranges can be set by the user. For 
example, a ramjet’s operational Mach numbers might 
be set from 2 to 5.5, with altitude ranges from 30,000 
feet to 150,000 feet. Overlapping Mach numbers and 
altitudes between various operating modes allows 
POST to select optimum engine mode transition 
points if desired. Default Mach number and velocity 
ranges are provided for each mode. 

Performance in pure rocket mode is determined by 
analyzing a high expansion ratio rocket engine 
operating in a vacuum. A user-entered nozzle efficiency 
is used to account for losses associated with the 
expansion of the primary exhaust through the engine 
and then onto the aftbody. 



Figure / - Axisymetric Engine Station Locations 



SI S* S2 S3 S3 1 S4 S5 Sc Sc’ 

Figure 2 - 2-D Engine Station Locations 


Figure 1 shows the station numbers and reference 
locations for by SCCREAM for an axisymetric RBCC 
engine configuration. Figure 2 shows station 
locations for a 2-D engine configuration. The 2-D 
engine layout is more common for vehicles with 
scramjet capability. Station 1 is at the inlet plane of 
the engine. Freestream flow conditions at station 
‘infinity’ are modified by a single shock wave to 
simulate any precompression effects of the vehicle 
forebody on the engine. The forebody shape (wedge or 
cone) and the forebody angle are entered by the user. 


-3 



Therefore the flow conditions at station 1 are typically 
not the same as the freestream flight conditions. 

The inlet performance is modeled by a curve fit of 
the total pressure recovery and is a function of the 
Mach number at the inlet face. Variable geometry at 
the inlet throat is assumed. 

Station 2 is at the location of the rocket primary 
and scramjet fuel injectors. For ejector mode, station 
2 to 3 is a constant area mixing process between the 
entrained air stream and primary exhaust. 

From station 3 to 3’ an isentropic expansion of 
the flow is performed. This is generally beneficial for 
ramjet performance, but tends to penalize the scramjet 
performance. 

From station 3’ to 4, the hydrogen fuel is injected 
at a specified equivalence ratio and allowed to bum. 
Upon exiting the combustor, the flow is passed 
through a converging-diverging nozzle to the exit 
plane of the engine (station e or e’). 

For a more complete description of the flow 
process, the reader is referred to Reference 3. 

IMPROVEMENTS 

The following is a list of the improvements made 
to SCCREAM that will be discussed next. 

1. Scramjet analysis capability 

2. Rocket primary combustion 

3. Rocket primary propellants 

4. Detailed forebody analysis 

5. New POST output deck format 

6. Remote operation 

Some of the improvements have already been 
mentioned while discussing the general operation of 
the code. Each will now be discussed in detail, 

Scramjet Analysis 

As stated earlier, the previous version of 
SCCREAM lacked a scramjet mode analysis 
capability. Results from an earlier study by 


Shaughnessey 5 were hard-wired into SCCREAM for 
this mode. The scramjet capability is undoubtedly the 
most signif cant and important improvement made. 

Modeling of scramjet performance involved 
allowing a supersonic flow to pass completely through 
the engine without choking in the inlet throat, 
combustor, and nozzle sections. The conservation 
equations for mass, momentum, and energy were 
employed n a similar manner to that from the 
subsonic flow (ejector, fan-ram, and ramjet modes) 
cases. By careful arrangement of the iteration routines, 
the supersonic solution which satisfies the 3 
conservation equations can always be obtained. 

The entire mass flow at the inlet face is always 
ingested by the engine. The flow at station 1 is passed 
through the inlet and oblique shock system (not 
actually modeled in detail). A curve fit for the total 
pressure recovery of a supersonic inlet, based on the 
Mach number at station 1 replaces the subsonic inlet 
curve fit. Figure 3 shows the subsonic and the new 
supersonic pressure recovery schedules. 

The conditions at the location of the rocket- 
primary (station 2) are then determined. This is a 
simple iteration procedure and as long as the area 
blockage from the rocket-primary is not too large, then 
a supersonic Mach number at station 2 can be 
obtained. If the area downstream of the inlet is too 
small, a common occurrence for RBCC configurations 
with oversized primaries, the downstream primary 
blockage will choke the flow to subsonic conditions. 
For these cases, a solution is not obtained. 



Fig ire 3 - Inlet Total Pressure Recovery 


The hydrogen fuel is injected and mixed from 
station 2 to station 3, without any reaction occurring 


- 4 - 




(no heat addition). This is done to simulate injecting 
the fuel further upstream, as often required for 
supersonic combustion to allow adequate mixing. The 
added fuel changes the molecular weight and specific 
heat of the flow. This slightly affects the static 
conditions at station 3. A total pressure loss is 
simulated in the mixer section by defining an 
efficiency factor. 

When solving for the static conditions at station 
3, a new iteration procedure is required. Recall that for 
the subsonic flow cases, the assumption was that the 
static temperature is close to the total temperature. 
The mixture specific heat capacity was then calculated 
using the total temperature. This allowed for a much 
simpler iteration routine involving Mach number, 
which can easily be bounded between Mach 0 and 
Mach 1. For supersonic flow, the assumption of the 
static temperature being close to the total temperature 
is poor. A new routine has been devised that now 
includes the specific heat in the determination of the 
static conditions. 

The static temperature at station 3 is iterated upon 
instead of the Mach number. This creates some 
problems because of the difficulty in setting upper and 
lower bounds on the temperature that will always 
ensure a supersonic solution is obtained. The exact 
problems encountered will be discussed later. 

With an assumed static temperature and known 
flow composition, the mixture specific heat can be 
obtained. JANNAF based curve fits of the specific 
heat for each species a function of temperature is used 
by SCCREAM. A mass averaging technique is then 
used to determine the specific heat of the mixture. 

Once the specific heat is obtained, the specific 
heat ratio can then be easily calculated since the 
molecular weight is known. The total enthalpy of the 
flow at station 3 is the same as that a station 2, thus 
the total temperature can be obtained dividing the total 
enthalpy by the specific heat value. 

The known quantities are now static temperature, 
total temperature, and specific heat ratio. From these, 
the Mach number at 3 can be obtained using the 
conservation of energy equation. From the definition 
of Mach number, the flow’s velocity can then be 


obtained. The continuity equation, or conservation of 
mass, is then used to determine the static pressure at 
station 3. 

It is now necessary to obtain a new value for the 
static temperature to confirm the guessed value. This 
new temperature is obtained from the momentum 
equation. It is assumed that the added fuel has no 
contribution to the momentum balance. 

The new and guessed temperatures are then 
compared and a new estimate for the static temperature, 
based upon a bisection routine, is determined. This 
process is repeated until convergence is obtained. 

As previously mentioned, convergence problems 
can be encountered from iterating on the static 
temperature. If the guess is to high, the flow can have 
a subsonic Mach number at station 3. But, this 
condition can also result if too much fuel is added at 
station 2. A series of checks is used to either adjust 
the guess for the temperature or reduce the amount of 
fuel being added. 

After a solution at station 3 is reached, the flow is 
isentropically expanded to the area at station 3’. This 
process will accelerate the flow since it is supersonic 
and the area is increasing. 

From station 3* to station 4, the fuel that was 
added in at station 2 is now burned. The combustion 
process is modeled as a frictionless, one-dimensional 
heat addition process. A routine similar to that used 
from station 2 to 3 is applied again. At station 4, a 
minimum Mach number at or above sonic conditions 
can be set, with the SCCREAM default being Mach 
1.15. If thermal choking occurs, or the minimum 
Mach number constraint is violated, the amount of 
fuel added (based on user defined phi) is automatically 
reduced, and the analysis restarts at station 2. 
Complete combustion is assumed, with the combustor 
efficiency accounting for the unbumed fuel and 
resulting oxygen content. Species accounted for in the 
combustion process are: N 2 , H 2 0, Ar, 0 2 , and H 2 . 

After station 4, the flow is expanded out the 
diverging portion of the nozzle to the exit plane of the 
engine (station e) or aftbody of the vehicle (station e’), 
depending upon the current flight altitude. Since the 


-5 



flow is supersonic, there is not a converging section in 
the nozzle. The flow composition from the combustor 
is frozen, and the specific heats are again included in 
the iteration procedure to account for the decreasing 
static temperature from the accelerating flow. 

It should also be noted that SCCREAM can also 
be used to model a pure ramjet or pure scramjet engine 
now. These are non-RBCC engines configurations 
that do not have an ejector-mode nor the accompanying 
blockage at station 2 in the engine. 

Rocket Primary 

Previously, the user had large number of input 
parameters that had to be defined in order to properly 
model and size the rocket primary. These parameters 
included the total temperature, molecular weight, 
specific heat ratio, expansion ratio, and chamber 
pressure. SCCREAM was able to accurately 
determine the primary nozzle exit area and product 
exhaust velocity, but only after the user had over- 
defined the primary. Once in the engine, the flow was 
then assumed to be composed of 100% H 2 0 and the 
user-defined value for the molecular weight was 
overridden and set to 18.0, corresponding to a pure 
steam exhaust. Thus, even after defining all these 
inputs, the rocket primary could still only be modeled 
at stoichiometric conditions upon entering the main 
engine. 

To eliminate this discrepancy and relieve the user 
of the extraneous input parameters, Response Surface 
Equation's (RSE’s) were used to model the chamber 
temperature and exhaust product mole fractions. 
RSE’s model complex systems with simple algebraic 
equations. These equations can yield very accurate 
results for non-discrete models, as well as save 
valuable computation time. 

In all, 8 RSE’s were generated as a function of 
the chamber pressure and mixture ratio. The first two 
equations were for the total temperature and specific 
heat ratio(y). The remaining 6 were used for the mole 
fractions of: H 2 , 0 2 , H 2 0, O, H, and OH. 

The well established Chemical Equilibrium and 
Applications program, or CEA 6 , from the NASA 
Lewis Research Center was used for determining the 


equilibrium composition in the rocket chamber. For 
the analysis performed by CEA, the rocket propellants 
(oxygen and hydrogen) were both assumed to be in 
gaseous form at 298 K. The input parameters, 
chamber pressure and mixture ratio, were varied from 
500 to 3,000 psia and from 4 to 12 respectively. A 
total of 64 different cases were analyzed. 

After all of the runs were completed, a statistical 
analysis program , JMP 7 , was then used for setting up 
the RSE’s. The general form of each RSE generated 
is: 

X=a*P t +fi*P c 2 +x* MR*P + 5 * MR+ e* MR 1 ( 1 ) 

where P c is the chamber pressure, MR is the primary 
mixture ratio, and a through e are constants. A 
residual analysis of the RSE fits show excellent 
correspondence with the results from CEA. 

With the mole fractions now known, the 
molecular weight of the mixture can be determined. 
The flow composition is frozen and then expanded to 
match the user-defined expansion ratio. Basic rocket 
analysis equations are used for solving for the throat 
area, exit pressure, and exit velocity. 

SCCREAM was then modified to track all of the 
primary e>haust products throughout the rest of the 
engine. In doing so, operation of a non-stoichiometric 
rocket prin ary is enabled. 

Primary Propellants 

An additional rocket primary propellant, hydrogen 
peroxide (H 2 0 2 ), has been added. Concentrations of 
85%, 90%, and 98% H 2 0 2 can be selected and modeled. 
The non-H 0 2 percentage in the concentrations is pure 
water. Th< user is simply required to select the desired 
concentration, then enter the chamber pressure and 
expansion ratio for the primary subsystem. 

Hydrogen peroxide is a mono-propellant that 
reacts whei brought into contact with a catalyst like 
platinum or copper. For a given concentration, the 
decomposition temperature is fixed, thus the expected 
temperatures for the 3 concentrations are hard-wired 
into SCCREAM. The decomposition of H 2 0 2 results 
in a mixture composed of 43% 0 2 and 57% H 2 0 by 


-6 



weight, not including any initial H 2 0 present. 
Benefits of H 2 0 2 are the design simplicity resulting 
from having only a single working fluid, as well as a 
lower combustion temperature. The lower combustion 
temperature allows for increased chamber pressures. 
Typical values for P c are from 500-5000 psi. These 
benefits come at the cost of a lower specific impulse 
and exhaust velocity. 

SCC REAM will analyze the performance and size 
the rocket primary for the H 2 0 2 configurations. 
Industry data has shown that 100% decomposition is 
nearly obtainable, so a primary combustion efficiency 
is not used for these cases. The 0 2 and H 2 0 exhaust 
products are then tracked through the mixer and into 
the combustor. The excess 0 2 from the primary is 
added to the oxygen content of the air stream. The 
total oxygen mass flow is then used with the 
equivalence ratio to determine the amount of fuel added 
in the combustor. 

Forebodv Analysis 


SCCREAM allows the user to define either a 
conical or 2-D wedge shaped forebody to account for 
compression effects. In SCCREAM version 1.0, both 
the cone and wedge shapes used closed form solutions 
for solving for the flow properties behind the bow 
shock. For conical flow, this closed form solution 
will accurately predict the properties behind the shock, 
but not behind the shock at the surface of the vehicle 
and at the cowl lip. To obtain a more accurate 
estimate of the mass flow at the inlet, a more rigorous 
analysis is now performed. 


For determining the properties behind the bow 
shock of a cone, a system of 3 ordinary differential 
equations must be solved. They are shown here in 
their more familiar (spherical coordinates) form: 


Y> 


d$ 


(2) 


dv e _ r a 

dQ \vl-a 2 ) 


vv 2 

](2 *V r + V e *col6 — L ~) 


(3) 


dp 

dQ 


(V e 2 ~a 2 ) 


)*(V f + V # cot 0) 


(4) 


where a is the speed of sound, 0 is the ray angle, V r is 
the radial velocity component, V e is the normal 
velocity component perpendicular to the radial 
component, p is the static pressure, and p is the 
density of the flow. 

The reverse procedure of guessing a shock angle, 
as recommended by Anderson 8 , is implemented to 
solve these equations. 

Additional information about the inlet is required 
from the user (these input values are not necessary for 
a wedge shaped forebody). These new inputs are the 
length from the nose of the vehicle to the inlet lip and 
the height of the inlet. 

When equations (2)-(4) are solved, the flow field 
behind the bow shock is completely defined. A 

streamline that intersects the cowl lip can be 
determined using the additional input parameters. The 
mass flux is then determined along this streamline and 
averaged with the mass flux at the vehicle's surface. 
This value is then used as the mass flow rate seen 
across the entire inlet at station 1 . 

Output Deck 

The static pressures inside an airbreathing engine 
can be substantial and will significantly effect the 
weight of an engine. The trajectory flown by the 
vehicle will have the strongest influence on the 
maximum internal pressures that will be experienced 
by the engine. For freestream dynamic pressures (q) 
greater than 1500 psf, ramjet mode static pressures in 
excess of 200 psi can easily develop as the flight Mach 
number is increased. This can significantly increase 
the weight of an engine, and this information needs to 
be supplied to the engine weight model. 

Figure 4 shows the maximum static pressures 
experienced by an Ejector Scramjet configuration for a 
typical constant-q, single stage RBCC vehicle. Note 
that from Mach 4 to 5.5, the pressure increases very 
rapidly, especially for the q=2000 psf trajectory. At 
Mach 5.5, the q=1500 path has a maximum pressure 
of only 220 psi, while the q=2000 path experiences 
over 300 psi. These effects are indeed significant and 
must be accounted for in the overall vehicle design. 


- 7 - 



To allow for tracking of these engine pressures, a 
new table has been included in the POST engine deck 
produced by SCCREAM. This table contains the 
maximum static pressure experienced by the engine at 
every flight condition. This information can easily be 
monitored during the trajectory, and can be passed to 
an engine weight estimation code (WATES 9 ) during 
each iteration while closing a design. Alternatively, a 
maximum static pressure limit can be set in the 
trajectory model. POST can be constrained not to 
exceed this value for the static pressure over the course 
of the trajectory. 



Figure 4 - Maximum Internal Static Pressures 
Remote Operation 

In the interest of allowing easy access and 
operation of SCCREAM, a web based interface has 
been created. This interface allows for execution and 
retrieval of the results from SCCREAM over the web 
from any computing platform. The user must simply 
have access to an Internet browser (Netscape, Internet 
Explorer, etc.). The web interface also allows for any 
user to easily access the most current version of 
SCCREAM without the hassle of obtaining and 
installing the newest version. Currently, access to 
SCCREAM is unrestricted. The web address for 
SCCREAM is: 

http: //atlas, cad gateck edu/~jebradfo 

In addition to remote operation, the new interface 
allows for easy error checking before program 


execution. Hyper-links for each variable are set up to 
provide a brief description of each input parameter and 
give typical ranges. Sample engine configurations for 
a variety of RBCC vehicles have also been included on 
the page. 

The web interface is composed of three different 
programming languages. They are the common Hyper 
Text Markup Language (HTML), JavaScript, and 
Practical Extraction Report Language (PERL). 

The HTML portion utilizes the form ‘post’ 
method for transferring data to the machine hosting the 
SCCREAM executable. The ‘post’ method is 
preferable over the ‘get’ method when transferring 
more than one piece of information. The web page 
itself consists of radio buttons, pull-down menus, and 
text fields for the SCCREAM input parameters. This 
allows for easy configuration changes and updating of 
the engine model. Figure 5 provides a partial screen 
shot of the user interface for Version 4.0 of 
SCCREAM. 



Figure 5 - Web-based user interface 


The JavaScript routines perform error and range 
checking of the user inputs. This helps limit the 
possibility of errors being generated when SCCREAM 
executes. For example, if the user accidentally puts in 
a nozzle efficiency greater than 100%, a JavaScript 
warning message will be displayed. This message will 
identify the name of the variable with the infeasible 
input value and provide the allowable ranges for the 


- 8 - 





particular variable. The JavaScript also creates a more 
dynamic page, with default input values automatically 
changing based upon a user’s selections. As an 
example, if a non-supercharging RBCC engine (no 
fan) is selected, the fan pressure ratio automatically 
changes to 1.0, for no total pressure rise. If the user 
selects the pure-ramjet option, all input fields 
associated with the rocket primary subsystem are 
eliminated. 

Once all of the input parameters have been 
checked and verified by the JavaScript, an estimate of 
the total run time required is displayed. The web form 
is then processed by execution of a Common Gateway 
Interface (CGI) script. This script is located on the 
server for the SCCREAM host, and is written in 
PERL. This PERL script opens and writes to the 6 
text based input files, runs SCCREAM, and then 
displays the results back to the user’s web browser. It 
should be noted that the original text input files are 
still in place and the SCCREAM source code has not 
been altered to be compatible with the web interface. 
Therefore, SCCREAM can still be executed on a 
stand-alone platform that does not have Internet access. 

After execution of SCCREAM is completed, the 
user can simply download the results by selecting the 
hyper-links to the main output file and POST deck. 
The browser ‘Save As’ option will retrieve the results 
and place them in the user’s local directory. 

RESULTS 
Comparison with RJPA 

The Ramjet Performance Analysis Code 10 , RJPA, 
was developed at Johns Hopkins University in the 
mid- 1960’s. The Fortran based code uses a one- 
dimensional integral analysis approach and is 
applicable to a wide variety of airbreathing and rocket 
propulsion concepts. The combustor uses the NOTS 
equilibrium code for determining the chemical 
composition of the flow. Frozen and equilibrium flow 
analysis options can be selected. 

The RJPA engine model is divided into 4 main 
components: the inlet, diffuser, combustor, and nozzle 
sections. 


For comparison runs with SCCREAM, only 
scramjet performance was analyzed for Mach numbers 
from 6 to 12. A generic scramjet engine configuration 
with moderate internal area contraction and exit flow 
expansion was selected. 

For establishing the inlet flow conditions, the 
static conditions for temperature, velocity, and pressure 
behind the bow shock were specified for each case. 
These values were obtained from SCCREAM for a 
conical forebody with a half-angle of 9.2°. The 
physical area of the inlet at the cowl was 51 ft 2 . 

The diffuser section consisted of defining the exit area, 
total pressure recovery, and initial guesses for the 
specific heat ratio. The exit area from the diffuser 
corresponded with the area at station 3’ in 
SCCREAM, and was set to a value of 33 ft 2 . The 
total pressure recovery was made to correspond to the 
value used by SCCREAM, at each flight condition. 
Heat losses in the diffuser were ignored. 

For the combustor model, a constant area process 
was desired, so the exit area from the combustor was 
33 ft 2 . Skin friction and heat transfer in the combustor 
were neglected. The equivalence ratio and initial 
guesses for the static pressure at the exit plane were 
also defined in RJPA. For cases below Mach 7.25, 
the equivalence ratio had to be reduced in order to 
prevent choking due to the heat addition in the 
combustor. If the specified phi is too high in RJPA, a 
solution cannot be obtained. For these same cases, 
SCCREAM automatically throttled back the fuel flow 
rate from the maximum value defined by the user. The 
phi determined by SCCREAM provided starting points 
for determining an allowable phi in RJPA. It should 
be noted that the allowable fuel flow rate from 
SCCREAM was slightly higher than the value 
allowed by RJPA. To ensure a fair comparison, 
SCCREAM was run again with the same phi used by 
RJPA. 

For the nozzle expansion, an efficiency of 98% 
and an exit area of 204 ft 2 was defined. A frozen-to- 
equilibrium nozzle flow ratio of 0.667 was also used 
for determining the thrust and 1^ values. RJPA 
performs the nozzle analysis for both frozen and 
equilibrium flow. The frozen flow case should have 


-9 



lower thrust and 1^, when compared to the equilibrium 
case. Real nozzle performance is somewhere in 
between these to bounds, with kinetic models 
suggesting it is closer to the frozen flow results. By 
defining a frozen-to-equilibrium ratio of 2/3, RJPA 
computes a ‘real’ flow performance by averaging 2/3 
of the frozen flow results with 1/3 of the equilibrium 
flow results. The performance results presented are for 
the ‘real’ flow case. 



Figure 6 - C, versus Mach Number 



Figure 7 - Lp versus Mach Number 

Figure 6 provides the comparative results for the 
thrust coefficient versus freestream Mach number. The 
cowl area of 51 ft 2 was used to normalize the thrust 
coefficient. The dynamic pressure for most cases was 
approximately 2000 psf. 

In the Mach number range of 7 to 10, 
SCCREAM and RJPA match very well. At the lower 
Mach numbers, it appears SCCREAM underpredicts 


the thrust level predicted by RJPA. This is currently 
being attributed to SCCREAM not modeling the pre- 
combustion static pressure rise (the PSPCI term in 
RJPA) from the shock train. This pressure rise results 
in different flow conditions at the start of the 
combustion process, which in turn effect the flow 
conditions exiting the combustor. Table 1 provides 
more detailed information on the static conditions at 
this low Mach number condition. Notice from the 
table the static pressure and temperature differences 
exiting the combustor. These differences diminish at 
the Mach 8.75 and Mach 10 conditions, where the 
effect of the shock train pressure rise also diminishes. 
This lends support as to the theory of why the 
differences are occurring, but determining the exact 
mechanism will require further investigation. 

At Mach numbers above 10, the differences 
between RJPA and SCCREAM appear to be slowly 
increasing. As the Mach number and energy of the 
flow increases, the exact composition of the flow 
becomes more important. Of particular consequence is 
the fact the SCCREAM does not account for the 
hydroxyl species (OH). The presence of the hydroxyl 
molecule will effect the molecular weight and specific 
heat of the flow. These in turn affect the static 
conditions. Since this is not modeled by 
SCCREAM, a higher thrust value than RJPA could 
result at increased Mach numbers due to different static 
conditions at the exit plane. 

Figure 7 provides the I sp versus Mach number. As 
expected based on the thrust coefficient trends, 
SCCREAM slightly underpredicts the 1^ predicted by 
RJPA at the lower, reduced phi, Mach numbers. From 
Mach 7 to 10, very good correspondence between the 
two codes is displayed again. Above Mach 10, 
SCCREAM has a higher I <p in a similar manner as the 
thrust profi e.

Table 1. Flow Property Comparison for SCCREAM and RJPA 






















Comparison w it h O th er Codes 

The Hyperion concept’s ejector scramjet (ESJ) 
engine performance has been reanalyzed using the 
current SCCREAM (Version 4.0) model. Hyperion is 
a single stage to orbit vehicle that flies on a constant q 
boundary of 2,000 psf in scramjet mode up to Mach 
10. The vehicle is design to carry 20,000 lbs to low 
earth orbit from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in 
Florida. The forebody is a conical shape with a half- 
angle of 9.2°. The reader is encouraged to obtain 
reference 3 for more details on the Hyperion concept. 

As previously documented, RAMSCRAM 311 data 
has been generated based upon a similar Hyperion 
engine geometry and flight path. It should be noted 
that a ramjet to scramjet transition Mach number of 6 
was used for the RAMSCRAM data, but Hyperion 
now transitions at Mach 5.5. 

SRGUL was used by Shaughnessey 5 to generate 
ramjet and scramjet performance for a vehicle with a 5° 
half-cone angle for NASA-Langley. These results are 
for a non-RBCC engine with a different engine 
geometry and inlet efficiency. 

The RJPA results presented here are for the 
conditions previously stated in the direct comparison 
cases. The engine geometry is very similar to 
Hyperion *s engine design. 



Figure 8 - C, versus Mach Number(group 1) 



Figure 9 - Up versus Mach Number(group 1) 


Figure 8 shows the thrust coefficient comparisons 
for the 4 codes SCCREAM, RJPA, RAMSCRAM, 
and SRGUL. It can be seen that SCCREAM and 
RAMSCRAM match very well for the ramjet portion 
of the trajectory. SCCREAM appears to accurately 
predict an equivalent drop in thrust from transitioning 
from subscnic to supersonic combustion. Note that 
an instanta teous switch from subsonic to supersonic 
flow is modeled here, but a real engine would likely 
have a much smoother transition period. In scramjet 
mode, RJPA and SCCREAM agree very well, as 
previously shown. RAMSCRAM appears to have 
less thrust than SCCREAM and RJPA in scramjet 
mode, but still displays similar trends. 

The S*GUL data fits very well with all three 
codes at Mich numbers greater than 7. But, as Mach 
number decreases below Mach 7, SRGUL’ s thrust 
coefficient continues to increase while the rest are 
exhibiting a decrease. It is known that SCCREAM, 
RJPA, anc RAMSCRAM have lower thrust at these 
Mach numbers due to throttling of the equivalence 
ratio. The need to throttle phi to prevent choking the 
flow is lar gely dependent on the engine geometry and 
inlet efficiency. It is also known that the SRGUL 
engine flcwpath allows a phi=l at these Mach 
numbers, which accounts for the increasing thrust 
level. Designing for the phi=l scramjet condition can 
come at the expense of performance in other modes. 
This would not have been a consideration for the 
designer of a pure scramjet configuration. 


-12 





Figure 9 shows the 1^ profiles for the 4 codes. 
Once again, SCORE AM and RAMSCRAM match 
well for ramjet mode performance. SCCREAM and 
RJPA match almost exactly in scramjet mode, and 
RAMSCRAM is displaying similar trends again. The 
SRGUL Ijp profile does not coincide with any of the 
codes. It should be re-iterated that this is not the same 
flow path design and engine configuration. The data 
does provide an interesting reference for comparing 
RBCC performance with an engine designed for only 
ramjet/scramjet operation. 

Comparison with Historical Data 

Data from the early Marquardt studies for ejector 
ramjet and ejector scramjet configurations has been 
obtained. Results from this study are commonly 
referred to as NAS7-377 data. This data is for a launch 
vehicle with an 8° half-angle wedge forebody, flying 
on a constant q boundary of 1 500 psf. 

In 1988, the Astronautics Corporation 12 performed 
a study for the United States Air Force. The vehicle 
used ejector scramjet engines and had a 10° half-angle 
cone. But, the data obtained and presented here are 
results for a 6° half-angle wedge. 

Figure 10 shows the thrust coefficient profile 
generated by SCCREAM and compared with historical 
data. In the early stages of ramjet mode, the large 
increase in the thrust coefficient by SCCREAM can be 
attributed to the increasing phi in the combustor. As 
the flight speed increases, the maximum phi of 1 is 
quickly obtained. The thrust coefficient matches well 
with the NAS7-377 ejector ramjet predictions for the 
remainder of subsonic operation. SCCREAM and the 
trends from the Astronautics data appear to agree well 
in scramjet mode. Due to the differences in forebody 
angles, inlet efficiency, and internal geometry, it can 
not be expected that SCCREAM will exactly match 
these predictions. 

Figure 1 1 shows the 1^ comparisons of 
SCCREAM with the historical data. It appears that 
agreement over the most of the trajectory is excellent. 
But, it does not appear that the NAS7-377 and the 
Astronautics data have a change in performance while 
transitioning from subsonic to supersonic combustion. 
This is curious as the recent analysis from RJPA and 


RAMSCRAM both display the same drop in 
performance being predicted here by SCCREAM. A 
possible explanation is that a smooth transition was 
modeled between ramjet and scramjet operation.

CONCLUSIONS 

Significant improvements have been made to 
SCCREAM since its inception. The current version 
4.0 has retained its execution speed, while at the same 
time improving its accuracy and capability. 

Among the conclusions drawn in this paper are 
the following: 


-13 





1. A scramjet performance model suitable for a 
conceptual design environment has been established. 
The accuracy of its results has been confirmed through 
direct comparison with the industry standard code, 
RJPA. 

2. The required number of inputs for defining the 
rocket primary flow has been reduced from 5 to 3. 
This was accomplished at the same time as greatly 
improving the accuracy of the primary flow and 
increasing its modeling ability. 

3. The first fuel trade study capability has been 
enabled by addition of a hydrogen peroxide rocket 
primary. This primary can be operated at 3 different 
initial concentrations of 85%, 90%, and 98%. 

4. Valuable static pressure information has been 
added to the trajectory output deck. This will allow 
the designer to more accurately perform trades and 
model a vehicle’s trajectory. The new data can easily 
be incorporated into an engine weight estimation 
model. 

5. A web based user interface has been established. 
This interface readily allows remote execution, reduces 
the possibility of input errors, and eliminates the need 
for updating software by the remote user. 

FUTURE WORK 

SCCREAM will continue to be improved to 
increase modeling accuracy and capabilities without 
sacrificing speed, ease of use, and flexibility. Among 
many near-term improvements being considered are the 
following: 

1 . Addition of a combustor model that will allow for 
a non-constant area and account for friction and heat 
loss effects. This work has currently begun. 

2. Allow for specifying multiple compression ramps 
on the forebody surface. This will be implemented for 
both conical and wedge configurations. 

3. Creation of the additional operating mode known 
as ‘scram-rocket’. This mode occurs near the end of 
scramjet operation, while transitioning to the all- 


rocket mot e. It has the potential of maintaining 
adequate thrust through use of the rocket primary, 
while still utilizing the small amount of oxygen in the 
atmosphere to increase specific impulse. 

4. Establish a method for determining angle of attack 
effects. This is a fairly simple procedure for the wedge 
configuration, but there does not appear to be a quick 
solution for conical flows at an angle of attack. 

Once generated, these effects will be added to the 
POST deck for incorporation into the trajectory 
analysis. 

5. Provide on-line data plotting using the web-based 
interface. This will allow the user to quickly assess 
their engine’s performance. 

6. Addition of a hydrocarbon primary and secondary 
fuel-injector analysis capability. Hydrocarbon fuels 
have been identified as promising candidates for RBCC 
missile applications.

ABSTRACT 

Rocket-based combined-cycle engines are currendy 
under consideration for use on future, reusable launch 
vehicles. By combining traditional rocket and 
airbreathing operating modes into a single engine, 
multi-mode RBCC engines offer a number of 
advantages for launch vehicle designers including 
higher trajectory averaged 1^ than pure rockets and 
higher installed thrust-to-weight ratios than pure 
airbreathers. 

This paper presents a new computer tool capable 
of predicting RBCC engine performance (thrust and 1^) 
over a wide range of flight conditions and engine 
operating modes. The tool is called SCCREAM — 
Simulated Combined-Cycle Rocket Engine Analysis 
Module. SCCREAM is an object-oriented 
workstation-level code written in C++. It uses quasi- 
ID flow analysis, component and combustion 
efficiencies, and an inlet pressure recovery schedule as 
simplifying assumptions. SCCREAM was created for 
the conceptual launch vehicle design environment and 
is capable of quickly generating large tables of engine 
performance data for use in trajectory optimization. 

An overview of SCCREAM and the program 
logic is presented. Results from SCCREAM are 
favorably compared to historical RBCC engine 
performance data and to data generated by other engine 
design tools.

RBCC BACKGROUND 

Rocket-based combined-cycle engines are unique 
in that they combine the most desirable characteristics 


of airbreathing engines and rocket engines into a 
single, integrated engine. RBCC engines have the 
advantage of high average specific impulse (1^) in 
comparison to rockets, and high thrust-to-weight ratios 
in comparison to airbreathers. 

The concept of combined-cycle engines has existed 
since the mid-60’s. During this inception phase, an 
extensive study was conducted by the Marquardt 
Corporation, Lockheed-Califomia, and the U.S. Air 
Force on various ‘composite engine’ designs, as they 
were formerly called [1]. This study initially analyzed 
36 different variants of combined-cycle engines. At the 
study’s conclusion, two types of RBCC engines were 




Figure 1 - Supercharged Ejector Ramjet Engine [ ref 1 ] 

selected as the most interesting options — a near-term 
option and a far-term option. The decisions were made 
based on technological feasibility and resulting 
performance on a representative two-stage-to-orbit 
launch vehicle. The two final selections were the 
Supercharged Ejector Ramjet (SERJ) configuration 
(figure 1), and the more technically challenging 
Supersonic Combustion Ramjet with Liquid Air Cycle 
(ScramLACE) configuration. The SERJ engine 
configuration is composed of four operating modes: 
ejector, fan-ramjet, ramjet, and pure rocket. A 
derivative of the SERJ is the Supercharged Ejector 
Scramjet (SESJ). This configuration consists of five 
operating modes, the four from the SERJ and an 
additional scramjet mode. 

During ascent phase, the RBCC engine initially 
operates in ejector mode. The ejector mode utilizes the 
rocket primaries (figure 2) as the main source of 
thrust. Entrained air from the inlet and fuel from the 
secondary fuel injectors is also burned in the 
combustor to provide additional thrust. A low-pressure 




Figure 3 - Fan Storage Methods [ ref 2 ] 

ratio fan, located between the inlet and primary, may 
also be used. Once significant ram pressure is achieved 
from the surrounding air, typically occurring around 
Mach 2 to 3, the rocket primaries are shut off. The fan 
remains functioning up to about Mach 3, constituting 
the fan-ramjet mode. At Mach 3, the fan is removed 
from the flow path or perhaps windmilled in place to 
as high as Mach 6. Figure 3 shows possible methods 
for removing the fan from the flow path should that be 
necessary. Tie engine operates in pure ramjet mode up 
to around Mach 6. At Mach 6, depending upon the 
engine type (SESJ or SERJ), the engine will 
transition either to scramjet mode or directly to rocket 
mode. If scramjet mode is available, the engine will 
continue operating as an airbreather with supersonic 
combustion up to an optimal transition Mach number. 
Recent conceptual vehicle designs have suggested 
transition 1 1 pure rocket mode might optimally occur 
between Mich 10 and Mach 15. While transitioning to 
rocket moce, the inlet face is closed and the rocket 
primaries are restarted. Vacuum Isp’s in the range of 
410-470 seconds are typical values during rocket mode. 

PREVIOUS RESEARCH 

Engineers in a conceptual RBCC launch vehicle 
design env ronment need to be able to assess engine 
performance at each point in the ascent trajectory. That 
is, for a given altitude, flight velocity, and engine 
operating mode, what thrust and I sp are produced by the 
engine? This data is typically used in a trajectory 
optimizatic n code to determine a minimum fuel flight 
path to orbit. Figure 4 from reference 3 gives typical 
RBCC engine I^’s for a representative vehicle flight 
profile.

Figure 4 - Typical RBCC Performance [ref 3] 


Due to computing speed limitations, the required 
engine data is commonly generated off-line for a range 
of expected altitudes and flight speeds. The resultant 
database is formatted into a tabular form. Data is 
interpolated from the tables as needed by the trajectory 
optimization code. 

The current engine analysis tool, SCC REAM, is 
a descendant of tools generated under earlier research 
efforts. Original research in 1993 resulted in a simple 
spreadsheet model that was capable of predicting 
RBCC engine performance in ejector mode only [4]. 
The original model could also incorporate a 
supercharging fan if required. The spreadsheet consisted 
of approximately 2,500 iterative calculation cells to 
perform the internal engine flow calculations. The 
spreadsheet generated properly formatted tabular data 
that could be electronically transferred to a workstation 
class computer and imported into a popular trajectory 
optimization program, POST [5]. 

Subsequent research extended the original 
spreadsheet model to include fan-ramjet and ramjet 
modes of operation [6]. The number of iterative 
spreadsheet cells increased to approximately 10,000. 
As in the original tool, this spreadsheet produced a 
properly formatted POST engine table that could be 
electronically transferred to a workstation for trajectory 
optimization. Unfortunately, recalculation of this 
expanded spreadsheet was slow. In addition, for certain 
initial guesses of flow conditions, the automatic 
internal spreadsheet iteration was often unstable. That 
is, the internal pressures, velocity, and Mach number 
iteration could easily diverge for certain flight 


conditions. To remedy the situation, a new standalone 
RBCC engine analysis tool was developed. 

The newest tool, SCCREAM (Simulated 
Combined-Cycle Rocket Engine Analysis Module), is 
an object-oriented code written in C++. The code runs 
on a UNIX workstation, runs a full range of flight 
conditions and engine modes in under 30 seconds, has 
more stable internal iteration schemes, and retains the 
ability to output properly formatted POST engine 
tables. SCCREAM is not intended to be a high- 
fidelity propulsion tool suitable for analyzing a 
particular RBCC engine concept in great detail. 
Rather, it is a conceptual design tool capable of 
quickly generating a large number of reasonably 
accurate engine performance data points in support of 
early launch vehicle design studies. 

SCCREAM 

Overview 

SCCREAM has the capability to model the 
performance of four types of LOX/LH2 RBCC 
engines. One is the configuration identified in the 
Marquardt study — the supercharged ejector ramjet 
(SERJ). The other three are the (non-supercharged) 
ejector ramjet (ERJ), the ejector scramjet (ESJ), and 
the supercharged ejector scramjet (SESJ). While 
SCCREAM does not model supersonic combustion 
directly, scramjet mode data for the latter two engine 
types is scaled from a previously published database of 
scramjet performance from NASA - Langley [7]. 

SCCREAM operates by solving for the fluid flow 
properties (velocity, temperature, pressure, mass flow 
rate, gamma, specific heat capacity, etc.) through the 
various engine stations for each of the engine 
operating modes. Equations for conservation of mass, 
momentum, and energy are used. This process is often 
iterative at a given engine station or between a 
downstream and an upstream station. The flow 
properties are calculated using quasi- ID flow 
equations. Engine cross-sectional area is the only 
geometry variable along the stream direction. 
Component inefficiencies are used to simulate losses 
of total pressure in the mixer and nozzle, and reduced 
enthalpy in both the rocket primary and main 


-3 




combustor. The inlet is simulated by a simple total 
pressure recovery schedule. Thrust and I, p are 
determined using a control volume analysis of the 
entering and exiting fluid momentum and the static 
pressures at the inlet and exit planes. 

Most internal areas in SCCREAM are determined 
based on ratios to the inlet/cowl cross-sectional area. 
Default area ratios are supplied, so typically a user 
enters only the inlet area. The size of the rocket 
primary unit is based on a user-entered propellant mass 
flow rate for the rocket primary. These two 
independent variables can be varied to produce an 
engine with a desired sea-level static thrust and 
secondary-to-primary mass flow ratio. In practice, 
however, the inlet area is often limited by overall 
vehicle geometry or shock-on-lip conditions. 
Optionally, the user can enter a desired sea-level static 
thrust and inlet area, and SCCREAM will iterate to 
determine the primary mass flow rate required. 

In order to generate a POST engine table, a 
candidate engine’s performance is evaluated over a 
range of altitudes and Mach numbers. These Mach 
number and altitude ranges can be set by the user. For 
example, a ramjet’s operational Mach numbers might 
be set from 2 to 6, with altitude ranges from 30,000 
feet to 150,000 feet. Overlapping Mach numbers and 
altitudes between various operating modes allows 
POST to select optimum engine mode transition 
points if desired. Default Mach number and velocity 
ranges are provided for each mode. 

Performance in pure rocket mode is determined 
using flow equations for a high expansion ratio rocket 
engine operating in a vacuum. A user-enterable nozzle

Mach Number at Station 1 

Figure 5 - MIL-E-5007D Inlet Pressure Recovery 

efficiency is used to account for losses associated with 
the expansion of the primary exhaust through the 
engine and then onto the aftbody. 

Station Calculations 

Figure 5 shows the station numbers and reference 
locations for a generic RBCC engine used by 
SCCREAM. Station 1 is the inlet plane of the engine. 
Freestream flow conditions at station ‘infinity’ are 
modified by a single shock wave to simulate the 
precompression effect of a vehicle forebody on the 
engine. The forebody shape (wedge or cone) and the 
forebody angle are entered by the user. Therefore the 
flow condi ions at station 1 are typically not the same 
as the freestream flight conditions. 

From station 1 to station 2, the total pressure 
recovery through the inlet is determined using a 
standard Mil-Spec recovery schedule for an inlet 
terminating with a normal shock (figure 6). Pressure 
recovery is defined as the total or stagnation pressure at 
station 2 d vided by the total pressure at station 1 . If a 
supercharging fan is present and operating, the total 
pressure at station 2 is subsequently adjusted by the 
fan pressure ratio. Typical single-stage fan pressure 
ratios are 1.3 to 1.5. Total enthalpy from station 1 to 
station 2 s constant. The mixer is assumed to be of 
constant cross sectional area, but the flow area at 
station 2 n reduced by the total exit area of the rocket 
primaries. That is, 

A 2 = Aj - Ap (1) 


Figure 5 - SCCREAM Station Locations 


- 4 - 



where A p is a function of the size of the rocket 
primaries. A 2 is therefore a ‘pinch point’ in the engine 
inlet due to the blockage caused by the rocket primary. 

In ejector mode, the secondary mass flow (i.e. the 
mass flow rate of air through the inlet) is determined 
by the minimum inlet area or ‘inlet throat’ area. The 
flow is assumed to be choked at this point. By default, 
the inlet throat area is assumed to be 25% of the inlet 
area in ejector mode. Should the combination of rocket 
exhaust from the primaries and secondary air flow 
through the inlet exceed that amount which can be 
passed through the mixer exit (A 3 ) for a given flight 
condition, SCCREAM automatically reduces the inlet 
throat area and thus the secondary airflow through the 
engine until the flow is just choked at station 3. 

In fan-ramjet and ramjet modes, the default inlet 
throat area is assumed to be equal to A 2 . That is, the 
inlet is opened up until the minimum inlet area occurs 
at the pinch point around the rocket primaries. In this 
case, the secondary airflow through the engine is either 
the mass flow rate that can be passed through station 2 
or the maximum mass flow rate captured by a wide 
open inlet area — whichever is less. At flight Mach 
numbers up to 3 or 4, the secondary mass flow tends 
to be limited by the pinch point at A 2 (note that the 
inlet area A! must also be reduced in this case). At 
higher Mach numbers, the secondary mass flow is 
generally limited by the maximum inlet area and is 
more typical of standard ramjet analysis. 

Knowing total pressure, total enthalpy, secondary 
mass flow, and area, the solution for the Mach number 
at station 2 is iterative. For a guessed Mach number, 
the flow velocity at station 2 can be calculated in two 
ways — one using the temperature and Mach number 
(i.e. the definition of Mach number) and the other 
using pressure, temperature and mass flow rate (i.e. 
conservation of mass). SCCREAM uses a bisection 
routine to find the Mach number that drives the 
difference between the two calculated velocities to zero. 
For ejector, fan-ram, and ramjet modes, the subsonic 
solution for Mach number is always selected. 

Between stations 2 and 3, the primary rocket 
exhaust (if present) is mixed with the secondary air 
from the inlet. SCCREAM assumes that the rocket 
primaries operate stoichiometrically (LH2/LOX = 1/8 


by weight) and that no combustion occurs in the 
mixer. This is known as the diffusion-then- 
afterbuming cycle. Again, the equations for 
conservation of mass, momentum, and energy are used 
to iteratively solve for the static pressure, temperature, 
and velocity at station 3 using the Mach number as an 
iteration variable. New primary + secondary flow 
specific heat (C p ), ratio of specific heats (y)» and 
molecular weight are also calculated at station 3 during 
the iteration process. Mass averaging techniques are 
used for C p and molecular weight. The primary rocket 
mass flow rate (set by the user), the exhaust velocity, 
enthalpy, and pressure, the primary exit area, and the 
secondary flow conditions at station 2 are all knowns 
in the station 3 iteration process. As previously 
mentioned, if the total mass flow rate in ejector mode 
is too large to be passed through station 3, the inlet 
throat area is reduced until the flow is just choked at 
station 3. The total pressure calculated at station 3 
after the solution has converged is multiplied by a 
mixer efficiency to account for viscous losses, etc. 

The flow undergoes a simple isentropic expansion 
from station 3 to station 3’ — just before the 
secondary fuel injectors. The combustor is assumed to 
be constant area. Therefore, 

A r = A 4 (2) 

The combustor area is input by the user as a ratio to 
the mixer area (A 4 /A 3 ). The mixer ratio is specified as 
a ratio to the inlet area (A,/A 3 ). Default area ratio 
values are provided. 

The combustor operates at a user-defined 
maximum equivalence ratio, phi. Phi is the actual 
fuel-to-air ratio divided by the stoichiometric fiiel-to-air 
ratio. A phi of 1 indicates stoichiometric combustor 
operation. For a given phi, SCCREAM uses the 
conservation equations for heat and mass addition in a 
1-D flow to determine the exit conditions from the 
combustor (station 4). As with other stations, these 
equations require an iterative solution. The combustion 
of hydrogen fuel with atmospheric oxygen is modeled 
as a heat release based on the fuel flow rate and the 
heat of reaction. An efficiency is included on the heat 
of reaction. Combustion is assumed to be complete 
and one way. 0 2 , H 2 , H 2 0, and N 2 are the only valid 
combustion species. A phi = 1 therefore results in 


-5 




Figure 7 - SCCREAM Execution and Data Flow 


only H 2 0 and N 2 products of combustion. A new y, 
C p , and molecular weight are also calculated at station 
4. 

If the user-input maximum phi results in a mass 
flow rate that cannot be passed through the combustor 
exit, SCCREAM automatically reduces phi at that 
flight condition until the flow is just choked at station 
4. This typically occurs at the lower Mach numbers in 
fan-ramjet and ramjet modes. 

The total pressure entering the nozzle (just past 
station 4) is reduced by a nozzle efficiency to account 
for viscous losses in the nozzle. Otherwise, the 
chemistry of the nozzle is assumed to be frozen at the 
composition exiting the combustor. The nozzle is a 
simple converging-diverging nozzle that expands the 
flow to supersonic speeds. At lower altitudes, the 
nozzle expands the flow to atmospheric pressure (ideal 
expansion). At higher altitudes, nozzle expansion is 
limited by a maximum exit area and the flow is often 
underexpanded. SCCREAM allows a user to model the 
effect of vehicle aftbody expansion by including a 
‘maximum theoretical expansion area* that increases 
with altitude. The rate at which the theoretical exit area 
increases and it’s maximum value are user inputs. The 
exit pressure, exit velocity, and exit mass flow rate are 
used in a control volume equation along with the inlet 
conditions to determine the overall engine thrust, 


thrust coefficient (Q), and 1^. Thrust coefficient in the 
airbreathing modes is defined as, 

C' (3) 

q * a, 

where A, is a fixed constant (the inlet area). C, is a 
common v ay to non-dimensionalize engine thrust to 
enable parametric scaling by inlet size and flight path. 

Program Execution 

Figure 7 is a flowchart that describes the general 
execution logic of SCCREAM. The flow diagram 
begins wih the ‘Execute SCCREAM* block and 
proceeds th rough each operational mode of the engine, 
with a fev contingencies depending upon the engine 
configuratnn selected. Worth noting is the ‘flow 
equations database* block. This block represents a C++ 
class object that contains all the necessary equations to 
determine temperatures, pressures, Mach numbers, etc. 
at each station inside the engine. The equations in this 
shared database are used in determining performance in 
the ejector fan-ramjet, and ramjet modes. The use of 
C++ and the class construct eliminates the need for 
excessive variable passing, as all variables are 
contained in a common area accessible by each other. 
This feature makes SCCREAM easy to read, debug, 
and modify .

Note that the flowchart also includes a block 
labeled ‘scramjet’. While SCCREAM does not analyze 
supersonic combustion directly, a previously published 
scramjet performance database [7] generated at NASA - 
Langley has been included in SCCREAM for creating 
engine performance tables for scramjet-capable SESJ 
and ESJ RBCC engines. This existing data consists of 
a table of scramjet 1^ and C t vs. Mach number. It is 
linearly scaled to provide a smooth transition from 
SCCREAM’s Mach 5 ramjet data at each altitude. 
That is, for scramjet engines, SCCREAM is used to 
generate ramjet values for C, and 1^ up to Mach 5 for 
various altitudes. Then the NASA scramjet data is 
scaled up or down and appended to the SCCREAM 
date at each altitude so that no discontinuity occurs in 
C t or I sp , but the trends in the NASA data are 
maintained.

design variables (figure 8) is used by all modes except 
for scramjet. Included in this file are the primary flow 
rate, engine geometry, and station efficiencies. After 
each engine mode has been analyzed, a properly 
formatted POST engine file (figure 9) and additional 
data analysis files are created. SCCREAM runs very 
quickly. 100 different flight conditions and operating 
modes can be analyzed in about 30 seconds on a 
Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 workstation. 


RESULTS 


Reference Vehicle 

To compare the RBCC engine data generated by 
SCCREAM to data available from other sources, a test 
case vehicle was adopted. Figure 10 shows a packaging 
view of the Hyperion launch vehicle. Hyperion is an 
advanced single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) launch vehicle 
currently being investigated by students in the 
Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory at Georgia 
Tech. The vehicle is fully reusable and takes off and 
lands horizontally. It uses five LOX/LH2 ejector 
scramjet (ESJ) RBCC engines for primary propulsion. 
Small rocket engines are provided on the top of the 
aftbody to provide trim on ascent. The forebody has a 
conical lower surface with a 10° cone half angle and a 
shallow elliptical upper surface. 



Figure 10 - Hyperion SSTO Launch Vehicle 

Hyperion is capable of powered landing and self- 
ferry using four small hydrocarbon-fueled ducted fans 
mounted under the wings. These engines are protected 
by a retractable inlet cover during ascent and entry.

Hyperion is designed to deliver 10,000 lb to the 
International Space Station (220 nmi. x 220 nmi. x 
51.6°) from Kennedy Space Center. It is unpiloted and 
could be operational by the year 2010. In ramjet and 
scramjet modes, the vehicle flies a constant dynamic 
pressure boundary trajectory of 1,500 psf (figure 11). 
Transition from scramjet mode to pure rocket mode 
occurs at Mach 10. 

Table 1 summarizes the per engine ESJ engine 
characteristics for each of the five RBCC engines on 
the Hyperion. Note that the combination of required 
sea-level static thrust and fixed inlet area resulted in an 
ejector mode primary mass flow rate of 216 Ibm/s. A 
pure rocket mode vacuum I sp of 462 sec. was assumed.

Figure:. 12 and 13 show a sample of the data set 
generated for ejector mode. Note the expected 
improvement in ejector 1^, and thrust as the vehicle 
accelerates [increases secondary flow rate). However, 
this augmer tation effect is reduced at higher altitudes.

Right Mach Number 


Figure 15 - Ramjet Mode C ’ Results 

SCCREAM generated data for ramjet mode 1^ and 
thrust coefficient are shown in figures 14 and 15. Note 
the unusual behavior in I sp around Mach 3. As 
expected, the I sp rises between Mach 2 and Mach 2.5 as 
thrust increases due to increased total pressure and 
secondary mass flow rate through the engine. However 
at around Mach 2.5, the 1^ unexpectedly begins to 
decline. A more detailed investigation of the results 
indicated that this decline is a result of secondary mass 
flow being limited by the area at station 2 — the inlet 
pinch point. As flight Mach number rises, the total 
pressure losses through the inlet increase, but in this 
case, the increase in secondary mass flow rate through 
the engine is slow to offset the losses. This effect is 
also evident in figure 15 as a smaller increase in C t 
between Mach 2.5 and 3. 

Between Mach 3 and 4, the limitation on engine 
secondary mass flow rate switches to become limited 
by the inlet area (like a more traditional ramjet), but 
the combustor would choke at the user-input phi = 
1.0. SCCREAM has automatically throttled phi in 
this range. The result is a temporary increase in 1^ 
around Mach 4. and C t behavior beyond Mach 4.5 is 
more typical of a ramjet with a phi = 1 and secondary 
mass flow rate limited by inlet area. Note that the 
effect of increased thrust coefficient with increasing 
altitude is primarily due to the increasing theoretical 
(aftbody) exit area as the vehicle ascends. 

Using the phi = 1 SCCREAM data set, thrust and 
Isp were calculated along a reference trajectory for 
Hyperion. Engine performance was determined at each 
altitude. Typical engine station flow values at two 
points along the reference trajectory are shown in table 
2. It is important to note that a SCCREAM data set is 
not associated with a particular flight path, but is a

range of thrust and I sp vs. Mach number and altitude. 
Flying an optimum trajectory though the data set 
results in a specific history of I sp and C, (or thrust) vs. 
Mach number. 

Comparison with Other Engine Performance Data 

To validate the thrust, C„ and I sp values generated 
by SCCREAM, the results have been compared to 
engine data from other sources. The early Marquardt 
study [1] (referred to as NAS7-377 on the following 
figures) contains extensive RBCC engine performance 
data including ERJ ramjet and ESJ scramjet mode 
thrust and 1^ for a vehicle flying along a 1500 psf 
dynamic pressure boundary. The NAS7-377 data used 
in this paper is for an 8° half-angle wedge. The ERJ 
thrust data was converted to C t using an 82 ft 2 inlet 
area and q = 1500 psf. The ESJ data used a 100 ft 2 inlet 
area. 

A study of RBCC engines performed in 1988 by 
the Astronautics Corporation for the U.S. Air Force 
[3] contains C, data for a scramjet and complete 1^ data 
for a ESJ engine over a 1500 psf trajectory. In the 
reference, Q data is tabulated directly and does not have 
to be calculated from a known thrust. Although the 
vehicle baselined in that study was a 10° half- angle 
cone, the available tabulated I tp data in the reference is 
for a 6° half-angle wedge.

The effect of forebody precompression on an 
RBCC engine is not insignificant. Larger forebody 
angles tend to generate more thrust, but have a slightly 
lower I sp . In addition, internal geometry areas and 
assumptions will certainly cause differences between 
data sets. However, the data from NAS7-377 and the 
Astronautics study are thought to provide a reasonably 
good comparison for SCCREAM appled to the 
Hyperion trajectory. 

Figure 16 shows the engine 1^ for the two 
SCCREAM cases, the NAS7-377 ERJ and ESJ data, 
and the Astronautics study data for an ESJ. Figure 17 
shows comparison data for C t in ramjet and scramjet 
modes. Q provides a better comparison in airbreathing 
modes than overall thrust due to the differences in 
reference vehicle size among the data sets. 

Comparison of in figure 15 indicates good 
agreement in ejector mode and scramjet modes. 
However, SCCREAM yields a slightly lower in 
ramjet mode than the comparison data. It is thought 
that this effect is caused by the small A 2 in the 


Hyperion engine and it’s effect on limiting secondary 
mass flow rate at those Mach numbers. However, 
work is continuing to verify this conclusion. The 
SCCREAM thrust coefficient data in figure 17 is 
nicely bounded by the two comparison sets. Compared 
to the Ijp results, the larger differences among the C t 
data sets are probably due to different internal engine 
geometries and forebody precompression assumptions 
as previously discussed. 

Compariso n w ith Q ther Engine Analysis Codes 

A comparison also was made to evaluate 
SCCREAM against other engine performance codes. 
SRGUL is the engine performance tool used to 
generate the NASA - Langley ramjet and scramjet 
performance data in reference 7. SRGUL is a higher 
fidelity code than SCCREAM, but is more time 
consuming to set up and run. It uses oblique shock 
solutions in the inlet, a marching solution for reacting 
flow through the combustor, and a method of 
characterist cs solution for the nozzle. Viscous effects 
due to boundary layer growth are handled throughout. 
To achieve, this extra detail, each engine flight 
condition requires significant setup and validation 
time. SRGUL is typically used in a preliminary design 
effort where the vehicle, engine geometry, and the 
flight profile are better established rather than in the 
conceptual environment for which SCCREAM was 
developed. 

Note ti at the SRGUL data from reference 7 is also 
the data in emally scaled by SCCREAM to predict 
scramjet performance above Mach 5. However, the 
SRGUL data presented in the following charts is the 
raw data (unsealed) from reference 7 for both ramjet and 
scramjet m«)des. The SRGUL data was generated for a 
5° half angle cone. However, it is not for an RBCC 
engine. That is, the engine is a straight dual-mode 
ramjet/scra njet. There are no rocket primaries in the 
flow and therefore no pinch point in the inlet. 

RAMSCRAM [8] is a ramjet and scramjet 
analysis tool developed by the NASA - Lewis 
Research C enter. It is also capable of modeling ejector 
mode. RAMSCRAM is similar to SCCREAM, in 
that it wa*^ created for use in the conceptual design 
environment. It uses a pressure recovery through the 
inlet (or a kinetic energy efficiency) and quasi - ID flow 


-10 





throughout. The combustion model in RAMSCRAM 
is more detailed than that used in SCCREAM, and 
accounts for equilibrium chemistry. That is, the 
composition of the flow leaving the combustor is a 
function of chemical equilibrium determined from 
pressure and temperature. Recall that SCCREAM 
assumes the reaction is complete and that only major 
constituents are produced in the combustor. The 
combustor area in RAMSCRAM can be constant or 
increasing. 

RAMSCRAM does not automatically adjust phi 
or secondary mass flow rate if there is a choking 
problem in the engine (the user must correct the error 
manually), but it does have a feature to vary station 
area as needed to pass the mass flow (called engine 
design mode). The code can run a number of flight 
conditions at once, but the output is not formatted as a 
POST engine input table and must be post-processed. 
Typically, RAMSCRAM is run only for points along 
a predetermined flight path, rather than creating a broad 
data set over a range of Mach numbers and altitudes. 
RAMSCRAM is written in FORTRAN. 

RAMSCRAM was used (by the authors) to model 
the reference Hyperion engine geometry and to predict 
engine thrust and I sp at several points along the 
reference 1500 psf flight path. In ramjet mode, 
RAMSCRAM used the same inlet pressure recovery as 
that used by SCCREAM (figure 6). In scramjet mode, 
RAMSCRAM used a 98.5% inlet kinetic energy 
efficiency. The engine mixer area, pinch point area, 
and combustor areas according to table 1 were kept 
constant in RAMSCRAM. Inlet throat area and 
combustor phi were adjusted according to the same 
logic used by SCCREAM as necessary to prevent 
choking. Precompression effects for a 10° cone and 
aftbody expansion benefits were also included. 

Figures 18 and 19 compare the SCCREAM 
results to SRGUL and RAMSCRAM for the Hyperion 
trajectory. The SRGUL data is for phi = 1. The 
RAMSCRAM data is for a maximum phi = 1. When 
running RAMSCRAM, the secondary mass flow rate 
(pinch point) and phi (combustor) both had to be 
reduced to prevent choking in ramjet mode at Mach 3. 
The phi also had to be reduced to prevent combustor 
choking in scramjet mode at Mach 6. 


With the exception of the dip in the SCCREAM 
data around Mach 3, the SRGUL data and the 
SCCREAM data compare favorably in I sp . Recall that 
SCCREAM and RAMSCRAM model a pinch point 
area due to the rocket primary and the SRGUL data 
does not. The RAMSCRAM 1^ data bounds the other 
two sets but at a somewhat higher than expected 
margin of error. However, the I sp trends for all three 
codes appear to be similar. Note the sharp transition 
from subsonic to supersonic combustion operation 
predicted by RAMSCRAM. A smooth transition 
between modes was not modeled, rather the entire 
internal flow was either subsonic or supersonic. 

SCCREAM and SRGUL C, results compare well. 
As expected, the SCCREAM phi = 1 results are 
slightly higher than the SRGUL data due to the 
benefits of extra forebody compression (a cone half 
angle of 10° vs. 5° for SRGUL). The effects of limited 
secondary mass flow at the pinch point and a throttled 
phi to prevent choking in the constant area combustor

Figure 19 - C, Comparison Data (group 2) 


- 11 - 




are clearly evident in the downturns in C t for 
SCCREAM and RAMSCRAM at Mach 3 and for 
RAMSCRAM’s supersonic flow result at Mach 6. 
Recall that there is no pinch point in the SRGUL data 
and there is no downturn of C, at Mach 2. 

The higher thrust coefficient predicted by 
RAMSCRAM in ramjet mode is almost certainly 
causing the higher 1^, also seen in figure 18. Work is 
continuing to identify the cause of this discrepancy, 
but it is likely due to differences in the combustor 
model between SCCREAM and RAMSCRAM. 


CONCLUSIONS 

An analysis tool for predicting RBCC engine 
performance has been developed and is well suited for 
use in the conceptual launch vehicle design 
environment. SCCREAM uses a quasi- ID engine 
analysis method to predict engine I, p and thrust over a 
wide range of flight conditions. The code outputs a 
properly formatted engine table for use in an industry 
standard trajectory optimization code, POST. Among 
the conclusions drawn in this paper are the following: 

1 . Written in C++ and running operating on a UNIX 
workstation, SCCREAM is a significant improvement 
over it’s spreadsheet-based predecessors in terms of 
speed, stability, and flexibility. 

2. SCCREAM was easily integrated into the 
conceptual design process for a reference RBCC SSTO 
launch vehicle. SCCREAM generated engine 
performance tables were used to identify an optimum 
flight path trajectory. 

3. For the reference engine geometry and flight 
profile tested, the results from SCCREAM compare 
favorably with previously published RBCC engine 
performance data as well as data produced by other 
engine analysis tools. 


FUTURE WORK 

SCCREAM will continue to be improved to 
increase it’s accuracy and capabilities without 
sacrificing speed, ease of use, and flexibility. Among 


the near-term improvements being considered are the 
following: 

1 . The ability to analyze scramjet mode performance 
directly within SCCREAM. While the basic flow 
equations are in place, improvements to the 
combustion model, the inlet model, and modification 
of the iteration flow property iteration schemes will be 
required. This will eliminate the dependence on NASA 
scramjet data. 

2. An improved method of calculating specific heat 
capacity, C p , for the flow at various stations. The 
current very limited table look-up mechanism will be 
replaced with a more detailed table or curve fit. 

3. An improved inlet pressure recovery model. A 
new pressure recovery model will be created that 
includes information about the actual inlet geometry in 
the calculation of pressure recovery. 

4. Demonstrate that SCCREAM can be included in 
an automated launch vehicle design framework or 
computing architecture. From the beginning, 
SCCREAM was created to be a design-oriented code. It 
can operate as a standalone code, but can also be 
included as a subroutine or contributing analysis in a 
larger multidisciplinary design optimization 
framework. This capability will allow the system-level 
designer tc optimize the entire vehicle (propulsion, 
trajectory, :onfiguration, material, etc.) for an overall 
objective function (e.g. return on investment).

Notes and Issues: 

• fully autonomous (no pilots), up to 6 passengers can ride in module in cargo bay 

• metallic TPS on windward fuselage, simplifies installation & maintenance 

• ESJ RBCC engine builds on historical development; eliminates fan hardware and storage problems
