VI. Summary 

Pascal has evolved since its origin in the 1970's. A full demonstration of 
just how much the language has evolved would require a study of the 
Extended Pascal standard, the Object Pascal report, and the Compaq 
Pascal Language Reference manual. My own work in Pascal has spanned 
the last fifteen years, and I've witnessed the evolution of the language 
first hand. 

While the evolved Pascal goes far beyond what Wirth originally put 
forth, it does not sacrifice the original design concept: an elegant 
programming language that makes it easier to write correct programs 
and harder to write incorrect ones. 

Programming languages like APL taught me long ago to avoid seduction 
by a language which offers a lot of power while sacrificing readable and 
manageable code. I have programmed in a dozen languages in the last 
two decades, and I have enjoyed most of them. But when I need to be 
productive and when I need to establish a strong code base in a timely 
manner, a code base that I won't find painful to revisit, the language I 
use is Pascal.
