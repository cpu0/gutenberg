SUMMARY 



The process for dry powder impregnation of carbon fiber tows being developed at LaRC 
overcomes many of the difficulties associated with melt, solution, and slurry prepregging. In the process 
fluidized powder is deposited on spread tow bundles and fused to the fibers by radiant heating 
Impregnated tows have been produced for preform, weaving and composite materials applications. 

Design and operating data correlations have been developed for scale up of the process to 
commercial operation. Bench scale single tow experiments at tow speeds up to 50 cm/sec have 
demonstrated that the process can be controlled to produce weavable towpreg. Samples have been woven 
and molded into preform material of good quality. 

INTRODUCTION 

Because of the high melt viscosities of thermoplastics and toxicity and handling problems with 
solvents several years ago NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) began investigating ways to powder 
coat carbon fiber using fluidized bed, slurry, and electrostatic technology (1). It was felt that powder 
coated prepreg would have good drape and perhaps some tack. Powder coated tow was thought to have 
the potential to be woven into cloths and preforms and to be filament wound and pultruded Powder based 
composites offered the potential of being cost-effective to produce and fabricate. 

Experiments at LaRC and elsewhere have confirmed many of the expectations for powder 
prepregging (2). Some of the important features of the powder coating process are these: 

- Versatile: Thermoplastics and thermosets 

- Operates at room temperature 
Involves no solvents 

- Has manageable exposure to toxic materials 

- Requires no significant refrigeration: reduces waste/spoilage 

- Can be woven, pultruded and thermoformed 

- Offers a viable alternative to RTM processing of textile preform composites 

The dry powder process under development at LaRC overcomes many of the difficulties associated 
with melt, solution and slurry prepregging. In the process, fluidized powder is deposited on spread tow 
bundles and fused to the fibers by radiant heating. This paper reports the results of bench scale 
experiments that have provided test materials and design and scale up information needed for process 
development. v 

EXPERIMENTAL 

, „ . J he experimental system was composed in sequence of the tow feed spool with tow tension brake- 
the tluidization chamber with powder feeder; the electric oven; the quality control monitor; the take-up ' 
spool with tow speed control, Figures 1 and 2. Unsized Hercules AS-4 carbon fibers in 3K and 12K 
tows were used with six matrix polymer powders, Table I.

DESIGN RELATIONS 

The experimental equipment and operating procedures have been described in detail in previous 
reports (2,3). The bench scale dry towpreg system was operated over a wide range of conditions to 
confirm design theory and operating correlations for each component and thereby provide the basis for 
scale up to produce commercial quantities of towpreg. 

Tow Spreader 

The tow bundle enters the spreader at the throat of a flat expansion section, air enters at the tow 
outlet and is drawn through holes in the sidewalls of the expansion section into a vacuum manifold. The 
angle of fiber spread in the pneumatic tow spreader is the result of the force balance between the tow 
tension applied by the brake and the air drag on the tow fibers due to flow toward the spreader walls. Tow 
spread is controlled and maintained by adjusting the tension and vacuum pressure. 

Powder Deposition 

In the powder deposition chamber, the expanded fiber tow behaves like a fibrous filter. Particle 
collection is by momentum impaction, inception owing to van der Waals forces, Brownian diffusion and 
in some cases electrostatic force. Theoretical analysis (2) provides the following design relationship for 
the level of powder deposition on the tow as it passes through the chamber where the tow residence time is 

(P/[l-P]) = {ruU[D p + Df] (N/W t )} (Ln/UD (3.1) 

6 C = L/U t , P is the weight percent resin in the towpreg, W t , the clean tow weight per unit length, U t , the 
linear tow rate, D p the particle diameter, U, the gas velocity, p p , the particle density, D f , the fiber diameter 
length, N the number of fibers in the tow, L the chamber, n the particle cloud density, and the average 
fiber collection efficiency r|i = 0.00465 over a wide range of chamber flow recirculation conditions. The 
appropriateness of this design relationship for the powder deposition rate was demonstrated for the 
powders over a wide range of operating conditions, Figure 3, during experiments at LaRC (2,3). 

Powder Recirculation 

The fluidized bed unit is comprised of two different particle fluidization systems - upflow and 
downflow. In the external return tube gas flows up through the fluidized powder and conveys it to the top 
of the fluidized deposition chamber. The powder and gas flow into the chamber, pass through and around 
the spread tow with some powder being deposited on it, and flow down to the fan inlet at the bottom. The 
fan accelerates the particles and gas into the external tube to complete the flow cycle. 

Beginning at the fan outlet the pressure losses for each section of the powder recirculation system 
are as follows (4). 

Acceleration : 

APi=(Tlt+Pg)U 2 /2g c (3.2) 

where APi is the pressure drop on acceleration to velocity U and n t is the dispersed particle density in the 
external tube. 

The suspension flows from the fan outlet into the tube with a reduction of the flow cross- sectional 
area. The pressure drop for flow contraction is 



444 



AP 2 = K(n t + p g )U 2 /2gc (3.3) 

where K = 0.4(1.25 - S2/S1), S 2 is the tube area and Si is the fan outlet area. 
Vertical flow : 

For solids-to-gas weight rate ratios over 50 the sum of the pressure drops due to friction can be 
estimated using the correlation for vertical flow. 

AP 3 = 2.5Len t U s 0-45 (Dp/DO - 25 (3.4) 

The correlation is not dimensionless (4): L e is the equivalent length of pipe, ft; n t is the dispersed solids 
density, lb/ft 3 ; Dp is the particle diameter, ft; and, D t is the tube diameter, ft. The solids flow slower than 
the gas. Solids flow slippage correlations for high particle loadings level off at the limit of one half the eas 
velocity, & 

Us = U/2 ( 3. 5) 

Flow resistance due to smooth 90° bends may be expressed as 26D t of equivalent pipe length (4) so that 
lor the two bends 

L e = L + (2) (26)D t = L + 52D t (3.6) 

combining equations gives 

AP3 = 2.5(L + 52D t ) (n t + p g ) (U/2)0-45( Dp/Dt) 0.25 (3 7) 

Column pressure : 

The vertical column pressure difference between that of the tube and the chamber is 

AP4 = (n t -n)h (3 8) 

where n t is the particle cloud density in the vertical tube and n the particle cloud density in the deposition 
chamber. v 

Chamber flow : 

The suspension flows from the tube into the chamber with an expansion of the flow cross-sectional 
area. The pressure drop for flow area expansion is 

AP 5 = (n t + Pg)(U2/2g c )(l - S1/S2) (3.9) 

Friction resistance for flow downward in the deposition chamber is assumed to be negligible compared to 
the other flow resistances. 

Total pressure loss : 

The sum of the above pressure losses represents the system resistance to flow and is provided by 
the tan recirculation. Consideration of the magnitudes of the various terms indicates that flow friction in 
the pipe and support of the suspended column of solid particles make up over 90% of the pressure drop or 
work required of the fan. F

Cloud Density 

The fan horsepower, system total pressure losses, and powder material balance may be used to 
calculate the cloud density achievable for a specific design at a given set of operating conditions (2). As 
indicated in equation 3.1, the cloud density is an important factor in establishing the rate of powder 
deposition on the tow. 

The stalling condition of the recirculation system is reached when the air flow in the tube, U, 
equals the maximum carrying velocity, U g , m , at which point powder accumulates in the vertical tube 
stopping the fan. Operation just below the stalling point provides the maximum particle cloud density. 

For upflow of gases and solids in a vertical pipe, the maximum carrying velocity can be estimated 
using the correlation (4) 

U g , m = 910 ( Pp /[pp + 62.3])D p 0-60 (3.10) 

The correlation is not dimensionless (4): U g , m is in ft/sec, p p is the density of the solid particles in lb/ft3, 
and Dp is the particle diameter in ft. 

Powder-Tow Fusion 

Towpreg flexibility and powder-fiber fusion are important for weaving and molding applications. 
These properties of the towpreg depend upon the temperature of the oven and the time that the powder 
laden tow takes to travel through the oven. Flexural rigidity data were obtained for towpreg having a 
range of resin content and fused at several different oven temperatures and residences times. The 
standardized cantilever test, ASTM D 1388-64, for fabrics, was used to determine the flexural rigidity of 
towpreg samples (5). 

Quality Control 

An instrument for on-line continuous detection of the towpreg resin content was developed in 
conjunction with Analytical Services and Materials, Inc. of Hampton, VA. Towpreg is composed of 
electrically conducting carbon fibers and dielectric polymer resin. The resin level monitor measures the 
electric capacitance of the towpreg, which is a function of its resin content. 

Once the system design has been selected, the operating variables are used to achieve towpreg 
quality control during production. The process outputs to be maintained, within certain setpoints, by the 
control system are towpreg resin content, powder fusion, and flexibility. During continuous operation, 
regulatory control over output variances is accomplished by adjusting the tow speed, powder feed rate, 
and oven temperature. 

COST ESTIMATION 

A preliminary estimate of the cost to make towpreg by the dry powder process was made based on 
the cost of the bench scale equipment, Table II. There are no multi-tow dry powder units upon which to 
base cost projections for commercial operation. Assuming that the process can be scaled up to the 25 tow 
level in 5-tow units, projections of the cost of such a system were made and are presented in Tables II and 
III. 

The impact of tow and resin costs are reflected in Table III and Figure 4. The powder 
impregnation process alone costs approximately $9.30 per pound of towpreg. Grinding solid resin to 
powder costs about $3.00 per pound. The cost of towpreg is the cost of the resin and tow plus the cost of 
milling the resin into powder and impregnating the fiber tow. 



446 



Towpreg may be stitched into uniweave tape/sheet or woven and braided into broadgoods and 
preforms. The cost to weave towpreg yarn in an 8 harness satin, 40 inches wide, is approximately $10.00 
per pound. These estimates suggest that the costs incurred in producing powder coated towpreg should be 
comparable to, and perhaps even less than, those incurred for producing conventional hot melt prepreg. 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Extensive testing of the bench scale dry towpreg system over a range of conditions has confirmed 
design theory and operating correlations for each component and provides the basis for scale up to produce 
commercial quantities of towpreg. The unit operated reliably with the various powders, using both 3K 
and 12K tows, for periods as long as eight hours, at tow speeds as high as 50 cm/sec (2). 

Test specimens of both unidirectional fiber towpreg and woven towpreg were prepared and molded 
for testing, Table IV. Weaving experiments indicate that the towpreg used as fill material must have a 
flexural rigidity below 10,000 mg-cm so that it bends and follows the shuttle action without breaking. 
Towpreg used as beam material must have a flexural rigidity below 100,000 mg-cm so that it does not 
break during heddle and comb action, and it must bind together the fibers so that they do not come loose, 
resulting in material thinning and comb clogging. This last condition requires using resin fusion to bind ' 
the unidirectional tow fibers in the beam material. 

CONCLUDING REMARKS 

Significant progress has been made on the development of the LaRC dry powder towpreg system. 
Polymer powders can be deposited on a moving carbon fiber tow in a recirculating fluidized bed and then 
fused to the tow using radiant heating. The flexibility of the resulting towpreg may be controlled by 
adjusting the temperature and time of the oven fusion process such that weavable towpreg can be obtained. 
Unidirectional and woven test samples, using both thermoplastics and thermosets, produced by the 
process have been of good quality. 

Design information and operating data correlations have been developed for scale up to commercial 
operation. Cost estimates suggest that processing cost are comparable to those of conventional hot melt 
prepreg. In the future, from a part fabrication point of view, powder coated prepreg tape, woven broad 
goods and woven and braided preforms may be considered as options to similar materials made by other 
methods.

* Assumptions 

The 25 tow system operates at 25 cm/sec or (50 ft/min) tow speed Standard 1.0 kg (2.2 lb) spools of 3K 
tow are used. The spool tow is 15,600 ft long giving a running time of 5.2 hours 

Allowing for loading, unloading, and maintenance it was felt that this level of operation would require one 
lull-time technician. M
