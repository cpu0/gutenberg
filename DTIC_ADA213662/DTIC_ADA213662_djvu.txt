1. Function of the Tailoring Tool 

The Tailoring Tool is designed in conjunction with the 
Comparator and Analyser Tool, to provide assistance to 
clients and Ada* Validation Facilities (AVFs) in the 
preparation of an Ada Compiler Validation and the checking 
of the results obtained from using the Ada Compiler 
Validation Capability (ACVC) test suite. Its objectives 
are to perform macro substitutions and to build an 
information file, which will provide input to the Comparator 
and Analyser tool. 


2. Operating System Criteria 

The Tailoring Tool requires that the following operating 
system criteria are available : 

a) The system must allow at least 8 character filenames. 

b) The operating system must allow filenames without 
extensions in order to allow the Tailoring Tool to open 
its output files. 

If the users operating system does not support these 
criteria then please contact the AVF that supplied the 
software-, who will pass the comments on to the NCC. A list 
of all the AVFs is found in Appendix C.

Within the Tailoring Tool the following naming protocol is 
required for filenames : 


FILENAME.EXTENSION 


3.1 Filename 

The convention used to allocate every filename within 
the Tailoring Tool (except those which have been split, 
see 3.2,) is as follows :

In tests where there is more than one compilation unit 
(multi-file test) , indicated by the use of the 
compilation number, all the units must be compiled 
before the test is linked. In a multi-file test a 
zero in position 8 indicates that this file must be 
compiled first. The order of compilation follows the 
order specified in the ACVC logbook. An 'M' in the 
main sub-program compilation unit indicates the main 
unit in a multi-file test.

90550-1,UG 


3.2 Split Filenames 

A Split file is determined necessary in order to :- 

o Allow specific lines within a particular test 

(normally 'B' tests) to comply with the 
requirement of the corresponding comment. 

o Allow a compilation unit to compile and run 

successfully. 

All Splits must be agreed by the AVF or AVO. 

The naming convention required to be followed for the 

Split files within the Tailoring Tool is as follows: 


1 

Position 

| Description

1 

36 | 


Char — Character 36 — Base 36 (0 to 9 and A to Z) 
Dec — Decimal 

The numbering of a Split (given by positions 7 and 8) 
must be contiguous for all tests split in a chapter- 
section-subsection set.

3.3 Extensions 

The extensions that reside within the ACVC test suite 
have specific meanings within the Tailoring Tool. 
These are as follows : 


Extension 

| Description 

1 

TST 

1 

| This file will need to have the Macro 

1 

1 


| substitution. 

1 

ADA 

| This test incorporates Standard 

1 


| features of the language. 

1 

DEP 

| There are Optional Implementation- 
| Dependent features in this test. 

! 

; 


If the users operating system does not allow three 
character extensions then the tool will truncate the 
extension down (See Section 4.3.1). The minimum 

extension size must be one character and even then the 
test file extensions retain their meaning within the 
Tailoring Tool and the ACVC.

4• Tool Implementation and Installation 

To allow the tool to be built and run using different 
operating systems, the Tailoring Tool is supplied as a 
series of source cede files written in Ada which need to be 
installed and linked into the Ada Library. TEXTIO is the 
only one Generic Xnstanstiation used within the code.

The following compilation procedures will result in an 
executable Tailoring Tool. There is no fixed order 
stated here, for each system will have its own protocol 
for compiling and linking. 


o Create a new application library with the 
overwrite facility enabled. 

o Compile each of the Tailoring Tool files. 

o Bind all the units of application code from the 
application library allowing the linking of the 
program to run. 

o Link the object code to create an executable file.

4.3 Activating the Tailoring Tool 

Before activating the Tailoring Tool the user must 
first make sure that : 

o All the A CVC Test Suite tests must be in one 

directory. 

o All the User Input Files must be set up and in the 
same directory as the Test Suite. These Input 
Files are described in Section 5. 

o This directory must be in the scope of the 

executable image of the Tailoring Tool. 

The Tailoring Tool will be activated by running the 
executable file 'MAIN'. The following tasks will be 
undertaken. 

4.3.1 User Inputs 

When the Tailoring Tool is activated the user 
will be asked to input information as follows 


a) Today's date - this is to be put in the 
form dd:mm:yyyy (eg 23:04:1988). 

b) A User's Comment - to go at the top of 
the macro replacement file. This has a 
maximum of 20 characters and should be 
used to identify the particular run. 

c) Whether or not the system is limited to 
8 character filenames. 

d) Whethe_ the system supports 3 or more 
character extensions. If the system 
cannot support 3 or more character 
extensions, then the user must state 
the maximum extension size.

90550-1.UG 


4.3.2 Tables 


The internal table structures are set up 
when the User Inputs are completed due to 
the fact that only the generation of errors 
will require further Terminal conversation. 
All the required information is obtained from 
the Input Files, which have to be set up by 
the user prior to using the Tailoring Tool. 
The screen will show what tables are being 
produced. These are local data structures 
and are provided solely for the Tailoring 
Tool's benefit. They are used to ensure that 
all the files have been processed by the 
Tailoring Tool at the end of the run. A 
definition of these follows : 

There are five tables defined in the 
tailoring tool. These are : 

Split Files Table 
Macro Replacements Table 
Special Tests Table 
- Withdrawn Tests Table 

Not Applicable Tests Table

4.3.2.1 Split Files Table 
Function 

Used by the Tailoring Tool to hold all 
the split file names associated with the 
implementation, together with a flag 
indicating whether the file has been 
processed by the tool or not. There are 
two parts to this table, a Split Table 
and a Split List. The Split Table holds 
the name of the test file which is 
split, and the Split List holds the 
names of the split files containing the 
edits.

4.3.3 Processes 

On executing the Tailoring Tool, the user 
will see the terminal screen scroll up to 

clear the screen, and then the information , 

defined in the User Inputs section will be 
inquired and the user must respond before 
the tool will continue. 

Having completed the inputs via the keyboard 
all the relevant tables will be produced. 

Once the tables have been completed the sub¬ 
processes using these data structures can 
proceed. The various sub-processes are as 
follows : 

a) Filenames are read in from FNAMES. 

These are checked to see if the filename 
is valid. If not then an error is 

raised and the next filename is read. 

b) If the file is on the withdrawn list 

then no further processing takes place 
and the next filename is read. 

c) The file is then checked to see if it is 

present in the scope of the Tailoring 

Tool, and, if split or has more than 
one module then the subsequent files are 
also checked for availability. 

d) If the file has a 1 .TST' extension then 

this indicates to the Tailoring Tool 

that at least one, macro substitution is 
required. All the MAX_INT_LEN dependent 
macros, that is the macros that rely on 
the maximum line length, are substituted 
together with those macros in the MACROS 
file.

Input Files 


Prior to using the Tailoring Tool, the user must create a 
number of ASCII character files. These files, called the 
Input Files are used to supply the Tailoring Tool with a 
list of all the filenames within a particular 
classification. The Input Files are : 

o FNAMES 

o MACROS 

o SPLITS 

o WDRNS 

o SPCLS 

o INAPPS 

o TSINFO 

The filenames must all be in Chapter order. That is 

alphabetically within each class.

Once all the tests have been dealt with and the 
information written to the TTTNF rile, the Tailoring 
Tool adds a completeness check count. From this check 


count the Comparator and Analyser Tool can reveal an 
indication of how much confidence the user can put on 
the data within this file.

7. Error Handling 

When an error occurs that is recoverable, the Tailoring 
Tool will ask for permission to continue. The only loss 
that will occur from this is that no completeness checks 
will be done. 

The Error messages that follow are found in the output file
