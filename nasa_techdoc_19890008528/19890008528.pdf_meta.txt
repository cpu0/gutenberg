x-archive-meta-description: A method for computing the skin-stiffener interface stresses in stiffened composite panels is developed. Both geometrically linear and nonlinear analyses are considered. Particular attention is given to the flange termination region where stresses are expected to exhibit unbounded characteristics. The method is based on a finite-element analysis and an elasticity solution. The finite-element analysis is standard, while the elasticity solution is based on an eigenvalue expansion of the stress functions. The eigenvalue expansion is assumed to be valid in the local flange termination region and is coupled with the finite-element analysis using collocation of stresses on the local region boundaries. Accuracy and convergence of the local elasticity solution are assessed using a geometrically linear analysis. Using this analysis procedure, the influence of geometric nonlinearities and stiffener parameters on the skin-stiffener interface stresses is evaluated.
