Preface 



This volume contains the Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on 
Intelligent Interactive Multimedia Systems and Services (IIMSS-2011). IIMSS-2011 
comes as a sequel to IIMSS-2008 (Piraeus- Athens, Greece, July 9, 10 and 11, 2008), 
IIMSS-2009 (Mogliano Veneto (near Venice), Italy, July 15, 16 and 17, 2009) 
and IIMSS-2010 (Baltimore, USA, July 28, 29, and 30, 2010). This fourth edition of 
the IIMSS Conference was organized jointly by the Department of Informatics of the 
University of Piraeus, Greece and the School of Electrical and Information 
Engineering of the University of South Australia, in conjunction with KES 
International. IIMSS is a new series of international scientific conferences aimed at 
presenting novel research in the fields of intelligent multimedia systems relevant to 
the development of a new generation of interactive, user-centric services. 

At a time when computers are more widespread than ever and computer users 
range from highly qualified scientists to non-computer-expert professionals and may 
include people with special needs, interactivity, personalization and adaptivity have 
become a necessity in modern multimedia systems. Modern intelligent multimedia 
systems need to be interactive not only through classical modes of interaction where 
the user inputs information through a keyboard or mouse. They must also support 
other modes of interaction, such as visual or lingual computer-user interfaces, which 
render them more attractive, user friendlier, more human-like and more informative. 

On the other hand, the solution of "one-fits-all" is no longer applicable to wide 
ranges of users of various backgrounds and needs. Therefore, one important goal of 
many intelligent multimedia systems is their ability to adapt dynamically to their users. 

To achieve these goals, intelligent multimedia systems need to evolve at all levels 
of processing. This includes further research and development of low-level data 
processing for information security, compression, transmission, clustering, 
classification and retrieval. This research leads into the development of new and more 
efficient intermediate-level intelligent multimedia systems for such applications, as 
information tracking, human and object monitoring, home and office automation, 
environmental information systems, or systems for rights management and licensing. 
Such intermediate-level intelligent multimedia systems are the building blocks of 
high-level intelligent multimedia services for such application areas, digital libraries, 
e-learning, e-government, e-commerce, e-entertainment, e-health, or e-legal services. 

Multimedia Services based on multimedia systems have made significant progress 
in recent times, as they arise in various areas including, but not limited to, 
advertisement, art, business, creative industries, education, entertainment, engineering, 
medicine, mathematics, scientific research and other applications. The growth rate of 
multimedia services has become explosive, as technological progress is forced to 
match consumer hunger for content. 

A typical example of multimedia service growth is the activity in mobile software. 
The term mobile services refers to services requested by a user of a mobile network 
through his/her mobile device. Early stage mobile services were centered on voice 



VI Preface 

communication (i.e., telephony) and were available only in telecommunication 
networks. However, with consumers requesting that modern mobile devices offer more 
than just voice communication, mobile software has already begun to provide access to 
a vast array of data and services. In general, mobile services, can be classified in several 
ways such as voice/call services (e.g. call forwarding, call waiting, calling line 
identification, missed call notification, or conference call service), location-based 
services (e.g. locating a street address or business or providing navigation information), 
transaction services (e.g. mobile banking or payments made directly over mobile 
phones), advertising services, and multimedia mobile services. 

Mobile multimedia services provide means for delivering multimedia content and 
information between two mobile stations or between a mobile station and an operator. 
Today, mobile technology is capable of offering its users commercial opportunities for 
creation and sharing of multimedia. Thus, a variety of mobile multimedia services give 
users the ability to use their device not just for telecommunication purposes, but also for 
a variety of other purposes, such as entertainment, learning, medicine, or advertisement. 

IIMSS conferences, following the general structure of KES events, aim at 
providing an internationally respected forum for presenting and publishing high- 
quality results of scientific research while allowing for timely dissemination of 
research breakthroughs and novel ideas via a number of autonomous special sessions 
and workshops on emerging issues and topics identified each year. 

IIMSS-2011 is co-located with the 3 r International Conference on Intelligent 
Decision Technologies (IDT-2011). 

We are very satisfied of the quality of the program and would like to thank the 
authors for choosing IIMSS as the forum for presentation of their work. Also, we 
gratefully acknowledge the hard work of IIMSS international program committee 
members and of the additional reviewers for selecting the accepted conference papers. 
Finally, we are indebted to the staff at Springer for their wonderful working in 
publishing the IIMSS-201 1 proceedings.

Abstract. In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), the sensor nodes are typically 
resource limited. This fact fosters the nodes to collaborate in order to implement 
their tasks. Therefore, WSNs are, inherently, collaborative networks. In this 
paper, we propose and implement a model that represents the various types of 
collaboration relationships that can be established in a WSN. This involves 
identifying and analyzing the different types of collaboration that may occur in 
any WSN. As a result, we propose a hierarchy composed by all types and dif- 
ferent levels of collaboration, and we propose a collaborative session manage- 
ment tool, called WISE-MANager. This tool allows bringing these concepts 
into practice, more precisely to the establishment of collaborative sessions. 
WISE-MANager increases the WNS's flexibility and the interaction between 
the user and the network. 



1 Introduction 

In this paper, we enhanced the CWSN model by defining a hierarchy of collaboration 
for WSNs. By bringing the main CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative Work) 
concepts into the area of WSNs, this work includes identifying and describing the dif- 
ferent types and levels of collaboration, as well as the collaborators that can exist 
within a WSN (which can be mainly classified in two types: humans and nodes). 

By collaboration we refer to any collaboration relationships that may be established 
between any two components of a WSN. Aiming to bring these concepts into practice, 
we have programmed ZigBee-based sensor nodes in order to establish collaborative 
sessions in a real WSN. 

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the related work. In section 3, 
the different types of collaboration are identified and described, and a hierarchy of col- 
laboration is proposed. Then, a definition of session and its classification is proposed. 
Section 4 describes the WISE-MANager tool and its implementation. Section 5 pro- 
vides some conclusions and some perspectives of future work. 

2 Related Work 

Most of works in the literature, that specifically focus collaboration in WSNs cover a 
specific type of collaboration, which is associated with the accomplishment of a certain

task, namely: signal processing [2], sensing [3], routing, localization [4], security [5], 
task scheduling [6], etc. Other works concern collaboration between wireless sensor 
nodes and other kind of devices (heterogeneous groupware collaboration) to support 
some specific applications. 

The work proposed by Liu et al. [7], called SNSCW (Sensor Networks Supported 
Cooperative Work), is the only one which presents a model for collaborative work in 
sensor networks. It is a hierarchical model that essentially divides cooperation in sen- 
sor networks in two layers; the first one relates to cooperation between humans and 
sensor nodes; the second one relates to cooperation between the sensor nodes. 

However, the SNSCW model only allows the modeling of collaboration itself. On 
the contrary, the CWSN model, which has been presented in [1], is a formal model that 
was created specifically to describe WSNs. However, the CWSN model allows not 
only the modeling of collaborative work (based in CSCW concepts), but also the mod- 
eling, formalization and visual representation of all the entities that can constitute a 
WSN (different types of nodes, clusters, relationships, sessions, obstacles, etc.), as well 
as its properties. Moreover, it considers more than two layers of collaboration. 

The CWSN model formalizes all the properties of each entity through first-order 
logic. Even though it is a graph-based model, it includes other objects [1] in order to 
make the modeling of all the entities of a WSN possible. This is of paramount impor- 
tance to completely represent a WSN. 

3 Collaboration Hierarchy in WSNs 

In this paper, we present a new approach that brings some of the fundamental CSCW 
concepts into the world of WSNs. The CWSN model is, then, improved in order to rep- 
resent not only all the entities that can compose a WSN and its attributes, but also to 
fully represent collaboration in a WSN. So, on one hand, we enrich the CWSN model 
with the most important CSCW concepts, such as: participants, relationships, roles, 
tasks, sessions and groups. On the other hand, we identify several levels of collabora- 
tion, going beyond the two levels defined by the SNSCW model [8], Thus, we extend 
the CWSN model with a hierarchical representation of collaboration. 

By collaboration we denote any collaboration relationships that may be established 
between any two entities of a WSN. It may refer to collaboration involved in transmis- 
sion of data between any two entities of the network, or to the collaboration required so 
that nodes can perform the majority of their tasks, which is a consequence of their se- 
vere resource limitations. However, the types of collaboration are determined by the 
types of nodes that exist in a WSN, since each type of node has its specific tasks. Con- 
sequently, the different types of collaboration that exist in a WSN are a natural result of 
its inherent hierarchy. For example, only the sink node can send data to the user; con- 
sequently, all the other nodes have to forward data towards the sink node; therefore, the 
sink node is naturally on the higher levels of the WSN hierarchy. 

Even though the collaboration activities in a WSN depend essentially on the type of 
nodes involved in a collaboration relationship, which results in different levels of col- 
laboration, other reasons for collaborating can be identified. In WSNs, collaboration 
typically occurs among nodes located in a certain region, which means that the group 
of nodes may not always be the same (location-centric collaboration), opposing to 



Managing Collaborative Sessions in WSNs 3 

traditional networks (node-centric collaboration). Nevertheless, besides location-based 
collaboration, it is possible to identify other ways to collaborate, based whether in 
monitoring a common phenomenon or in the hardware characteristics of the nodes 
themselves. 

3.1 Types of Collaboration 

Analyzing collaboration in WSNs from the point of view of relationships and interac- 
tions established among collaborators (or participants), we can identify essentially 
three main types of collaboration [8]: 1) collaboration between the user and the WSN, 
2) collaboration among nodes, and 3) collaboration between sessions. 

3.2 Collaboration Hierarchy 

Fig. 1 illustrates these different types of collaboration. Analyzing the figure, it is rather 
intuitive to conclude that WSNs present a hierarchy of collaboration relationships. This 
hierarchy can be composed by different levels of collaboration, as represented in 
Fig. 1: the node level; the cluster level; the session level; the network level; and the 
user level. Besides, according to the types of collaboration presented above, collabora- 
tion can occur either within a certain level (horizontal collaboration) or between each 
two consecutive levels (vertical collaboration). In the case of heterogeneous WSNs, 
even though it is not represented in Fig. 1, the wireless devices will be represented in 
the Node Level of this collaboration hierarchy.

Fig. 1. Multi-level collaboration hierarchy within a WSN 



In this work, we propose a definition of session as the essential unit of a collaborative 
activity in WSNs. A session is created based on different objectives defined by the 
user, such as: the type of phenomenon to monitor, the geographical area to monitor, the 
monitoring period, etc. 



4 L.M. Rodriguez Peralta, L.M.P.L. Brito, and J.F.F. Santos 

In the context of WSNs and considering CSCW definitions, sessions are composed 
by participants, the collaboration relationships and the respective data flows estab- 
lished among them, and the tasks of each participant. 

In a session, all types of collaboration relationships mentioned before can exist; 
therefore, several different collaborative groups can be established inside a session. 

Concerning the state of the nodes that constitute a session, a session can be classi- 
fied in one of four states, as represented in Fig. 2: 

â¢ Created - The session has been created but not initiated; i.e., the session is not in 
the open state yet. This is the first state of a session. 

â¢ Open - While the objective of the session is not fulfilled and some nodes are ac- 
tive, the session maintains its activity, i.e., it is open. 

â¢ Close - A session can become closed due to one of three possible motives: 1) when 
all nodes go into sleep mode; or 2) when all nodes are damaged or fail; or 3) when 
a temporary interruption of the session occurs (i.e., the session stops for a certain 
time interval that is settled by the user). 

â¢ End - A session ends due to one of three possible causes: 1) when the objective of 
the session is fulfilled; 2) when the predefined lifetime of a session comes to an 
end; or 3) when the session is aborted by the user (through the transmission of 
some command). 

â¢ Deleted - This state occurs when the user deletes the session and all the respective 
data.

Depending on the WSN specific application, sessions can be classified according to 
their temporal characteristics, as: 

â¢ Parallel sessions - Sessions that take place at the same time. 

â¢ Sequential sessions - A particular session starts only after another session ends. 

â¢ Synchronous sessions - The occurrence of these sessions is planned by the network 
manager. Parallel and sequential sessions can also be classified as synchronous 
sessions. 



Managing Collaborative Sessions in WSNs 5 

â¢ Asynchronous sessions - The occurrence of these sessions is not planned by the 
network manager. Rather, they can be started by some action (user initiated or node 
initiated), by the detection of an unexpected change in a certain phenomenon, etc. 

Defining a collaborative session with all its possible states, and establishing tempo- 
ral relationships between collaborative sessions is important to allow other researchers 
to better understand the operation of a WSN. These concepts can also help researchers 
to develop management tools that optimize the network management and that can 
make it more flexible. 



4 WISE-MANager 

In order to implement and validate the CWSN model, we have implemented a collabo- 
rative sessions' management tool, called WISE-MANager (Wireless SEnsor networks 
MANager for collaborative sessions). The WISE-MANager tool allows creating, moni- 
toring and managing collaborative sessions using the Zigbee protocol. The purpose of 
using collaborative sessions is to provide a better interaction between the user and the 
WSN, since the user can customize the type of monitoring to be carried out (sensor 
node, phenomenon, or time interval of monitoring), and query the network and its 
components. This way, the WISE-MANager tool increases the flexibility of the WSN. 

It is important to note that the proposed tool was developed in the context of the 
WISE-MUSE project [9]. 

Also note that the ZigBee protocol defines three types of devices: end devices, 
routers and coordinators. End devices correspond to sensor nodes with sensing capa- 
bilities, routers are sensor nodes can also sense data but they are essentially responsible 
for routing data collected by the end devices in the their WPAN to the coordinator, 
and, finally, the coordinator corresponds to the sink node. 

The WISE-MANager tool was implemented in Java and it is Zigbee-compliant. It is 
composed of two main modules: (i) Collaborative Sessions Management; and (ii) 
WSN Management. 

The first module, collaborative sessions management, allows creating and managing 
collaborative sessions inside a WSN. Users can configure the session's parameters (id, 
description, etc.), the sensor nodes that will make part of that session, the monitoring 
period, and the phenomena to be monitored (Fig. 3). After creating the session, the user 
can visualize and change the session's parameters. Moreover, he can also start and stop 
the session's monitoring at any moment, monitor the sessions that are in an "open" 
state, and delete them. Thus, sessions can be opened manually by the user or automati- 
cally according to the session's monitoring schedule. 

Moreover, the user can export the session's data to a MS Word document, choosing 
the session and the monitoring time interval. The document will contain the session's 
parameters as well as the data received during the session. 

In the second module, named WSN Management, the user can choose a serial port 
where the WSN's coordinator is connected. Using this module, the user can see the 
WSN information, like the PAN ID, the network channel, and the network components 
(routers, end devices, coordinator, etc.) and its parameters. Moreover, the user can 
modify the device's identifier (Fig. 4).

4.1 Case Study 



In order to validate the WISE-MANager tool, we have applied it to a heterogeneous 
network, which is composed of sensor nodes and other wireless devices that detect the 
state of the emergency doors at the Whale Museum situated in Madeira Island, Portugal. 

Several experiments were carried out to validate the proposed tool. 

One of the experiments consisted in the deployment of a WSN composed of six 
nodes (one coordinator, three routers, and two end devices). The main goal of this ex- 
periment was the monitoring of two separated exhibition rooms, as illustrated in Fig. 5. 

In this experiment, two different sessions were created, one for each exhibition 
room. The first session is composed of sensor node 3 while the second one is com- 
posed of sensor node 2. Both sessions monitor temperature, light and humidity, and 
they were executed in parallel for nine hours, more precisely from 23:00 to 8:10 am. 
The sensor nodes were programmed to measure and send data once each 10 seconds. 



Managing Collaborative Sessions in WSNs 7 

Another experiment conducted at the museum was made to test the emergency door 
device inside the WSN. Thus, we created two sessions inside the WSN: (i) session 3 
composed of node 3; and; (ii) session 4 composed of node 2 and node 6. This network 
is shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 7 illustrates physical location of the WSN inside the museum. 
In this figure, the whole WSN is represented using the CWSN model.

In this experiment, both sessions were executed in parallel, monitoring two different 
exhibition rooms. Session 3 monitored temperature and humidity, while session 4 
monitored temperature, humidity, light, and the emergency door state changes (emer- 
gency, open or close) from node 6, which was installed inside the emergency door's 
blocker, as depicted in Fig. 7. 

After these experiments, we verified that the WISE-MANager tool was able to cre- 
ate, start, close, end and delete sessions. Furthermore, all the data sent by the sessions 
was collected by the tool without any packet loss. 

4.2 Advantages and Disadvantages 

Analyzing Table 1, we can verify that in terms of querying the WSN, most of the tools 
are able to do it. On the other hand, none of these tools can create or use collaborative 
sessions to manage the WSN. The WISE-MANager tool allows customizing the moni- 
toring activity and defining the session's parameters. 

Moreover, the WISE-MANager tool, allows the user to control the network and in- 
quire the WSN, getting information like communication channel, network ID, PAN ID, 
etc. It is also possible to detect the network's devices and change their identifiers. 

Through collaborative sessions, the WISE-MANager tool enhances collaboration 
between the user and the network. Thus, the network is more flexible since the user can 
customize the collaboration, choosing different nodes to monitor different phenomena, 
and the monitoring time interval. Therefore, the network topology can be dynamic, 
since nodes can be active or inactive, according to the collaborative session's state. 
Additionally, this feature allows the energy saving of the network nodes.

5 Conclusions 



The CWSN model, published in [1], was specifically designed for WSNs and it is 
based in the CSCW methodology. It is a graph-based model, which great advantage is 
that, besides modeling collaboration, it also allows for modeling the entire WSN, all its 
entities, properties, relationships, states, etc. The CWSN model can be used, for exam- 
ple, as a framework for high-level configuration or programming tools (usually know 



Managing Collaborative Sessions in WSNs 9 

by macro-programming). Moreover, the CWSN model can be used to automatically 
generate some graphs of the WSN that will allow for identifying routing paths, detect- 
ing damaged/failed nodes or links, etc. 

In this paper, we have enhanced the CWSN model by proposing a hierarchy of col- 
laboration that identifies the different types and levels of collaboration that might exist 
within a WSN. We also correlated these types of collaboration with the different enti- 
ties that can constitute a real WSN. Moreover, we have proposed a hierarchical model 
of collaboration that brings the CSCW to WSNs. This work allowed us to conclude 
that the collaboration hierarchy, which is composed by distinct collaboration levels, is 
a result of the distinct roles that the different entities play in a WSN. A major advan- 
tage of the hierarchical modeling of collaboration is that it can be used by other re- 
searchers as a framework to describe the collaboration relationships established in any 
WSN, despite its particular application.

Abstract. Currently, there are several languages and tools that enable the 
creation of virtual scenarios. However, existing approaches are not intuitive and 
require a thorough knowledge of the user. The work presented in this paper 
aims at addressing this gap by the development of an intuitive framework for 
the creation of OGRE virtual scenarios with high graphical quality, customized 
multimedia presentations and supporting the distributed navigation and use of 
collaborative communication tools, such as VoIP (Voice over Internet 
Protocol), chat, etc. The proposed framework relies on the utilization of a 
generic metadata for the description of virtual scenarios which can be applied 
by different tools for authoring, and which can facilitate the subsequent 
automatic generation of OGRE code. With this approach OGRE developers can 
focus on the codification of the dynamics and strategies of the application being 
developed which helps reducing considerably the development time of these 
applications.

1 Introduction 

Currently, there are different languages and tools available for the development of 
virtual worlds. Nevertheless, the existing solutions are not intuitive and require from 
the developer a deeper knowledge of their components, representation and structure in 
order to be able to create a virtual environment. Furthermore, most of the existing 
solutions still lack the possibility of creating more complex virtual scenarios with: a 
high graphical quality; the possibility to integrate multimedia presentations inside the 
virtual world; the development of distributed applications which are able to provide 
remote navigation or communication tools such as VoIP (Voice over Internet 
Protocol), chat, etc., among other advanced features. 

One of the existing solutions for the development of Virtual Reality applications is 
the utilization of the graphical rendering engine OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics 
Rendering Engine) [1]. OGRE is a scenario oriented 3D engine written in C ++ which

provides a library of classes (APIs) for the description of virtual worlds and objects in 
a high abstraction level and graphical quality. 

Based on a literature review, some of the most promising OGRE editors available 
are Ogitor [2], OGRE Editor Multi Scene Manager Project Environment [3] and 
OGRE - MOGRE Editor [4]. These applications are in general well conceived and 
simple in order to allow the creation of virtual scenarios and they can be found in 
different states of completeness, sometimes being able to adapt themselves to new 
APIs and libraries. However, most of these tools have a proprietary representation for 
the virtual scenario created, do not allowing exporting the respective OGRE code for 
further implementations. 

Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to introduce and discuss the development 
of OGRE-Coder [5] which is a graphical tool for providing the visualization of OGRE 
virtual scenarios and the automatic generation of its respective OGRE source code. 
Another important contribution of this paper is outlined by the presentation of an 
XML-based language called OGREML [5] which was proposed for providing the 
interoperability among authoring tools. Thus, virtual scenarios can be created with 
any OGRE-compliant tool, and then exported to OGREML for the subsequent 
automatic generation of OGRE code. This approach allows developers to optimize the 
prototyping of their 3D applications since the time dedicated to the design of their 
graphical interface is reduced, allowing developers to focus on the programming of 
the dynamics and strategies of their applications. Thus, this framework is helpful for 
reducing considerably the development time of OGRE applications. 

2 OGRE Markup Language (OGREML) 

Based on the literature review, it is possible to verify that there are a few authoring 
tools for OGRE 3D environments. Nevertheless, these tools have a proprietary code 
and do not provide the automatic generation of OGRE code (C++ or C#). For this 
reason, it was important to provide a solution for generating OGRE code 
automatically, thus optimizing the prototyping of OGRE applications. Indeed, with a 
graphical interface for creating OGRE 3D scenarios, the OGRE developer is able to 
build his virtual scenario quickly and, after that, to generate all the respective OGRE 
code to the scenarios automatically. 

In this context the XML-based language OGREML (OGRE Markup Language) 
was proposed as a common representation for OGRE 3D scenarios. Therefore, the 
main goals for the proposal of OGREML were: (1) to describe completely all the 
components of an OGRE scenario and; (2) to provide the interoperability among 
different OGRE tools. 

OGREML is an XML-based language to describe OGRE virtual scenarios and it is 
composed of four major components: Ambient, Objects, Multimedia and 
NetworkConfiguration. All these components are gathered in the main block 
SceneConfiguration, as depicted in Figure 1 .

For instance, the component Ambient contains all information about the

values of the diffuse color and specular color, and its type), fog, sky, plane and 
camera. This component is illustrated in Figure 2.

The Objects component contains a description of all objects in the scene and their 
attributes such as: id, position in the scenario, scale and rotation, mesh file and if it 
can cast shadows. 

The Multimedia component defines synchronized multimedia presentations that 
may consist of videos, images and sounds, which will be displayed in the virtual 
world after the activation of a trigger [6]. 

The NetworkConfiguration represents the configuration of different network 
services among distributed OGRE applications, such as chat, VoIP and distributed 
navigation [7].

OGREML uses a simple description to represent all the components of an OGRE 
3D scenario, being at the same time expressive supporting most of the OGRE 
development components. In the next section we present further details on the design 
and implementation of OGRE-Coder. 

3 OGRE-Coder: Design and Implementation Issues 

In this section we present the main issues related to the implementation of OGRE- 
Coder such as requirements, use cases, architecture, and implementation aspects. 

3.1 Requirements and Use Cases 

The requirements reflect the needs that a client wishes to be fulfilled by the 
application being developed [8]. These requirements serve as guidelines, and most of 
the times, they may represent the objectives to be achieved in the project development. 
The requirements can be defined as functional and non-functional. 

The functional requirements describe the functionalities or services provided by the 
system (main functionalities). The functional requirements for the developed 
application were: 

â¢ Provide the user with a free navigation inside the virtual environment; 

â¢ Allow the user to open and visualize any virtual scenario described through 
the OgreML; 

â¢ Allow the automatic generation of C# code based on all the scenarios 
described using OgreML; 

â¢ Allow the user to visualize a scenario based on the generated C# code, and; 

â¢ Allow the visualization of multimedia content inside the virtual environment. 

The non-functional requirements are those which are not related directly to the main 
functionalities of the system such as, for instance, reliability, robustness, efficacy and 
security. The main non-functional requirements for the OGRE-Coder are: 

â¢ Provide a good performance for the automatic generation of C# code; 

â¢ Provide continuous and steady presentation of multimedia content inside the 
virtual environment, and; 

â¢ Allow future enhancements and expansion in the application, if needed. 

A use case diagram allows the understanding of all the possible interactions with the 
system, under the standpoint of the user (actor) [9]. After the definition of the 
requirements, only one actor was identified for the system, which is one responsible for: 

â¢ Choosing the scenario to visualize and map - The user can choose the 
respective OgreML file related to the scenario he wants to visualize and 
generate the respective C# code; 

â¢ Visualizing a scenario - The user can visualize a scenario from an already 
generated C# code, or from an OgreML file; 

â¢ Navigating in the scenario - The user can use the keyboard and/or the mouse 
to navigate and interact within the virtual environment, and; 



An Interoperable Environment for the Automatic Generation of OGRE Virtual Scenarios 15 

â¢ Visualizing multimedia content - The user can navigate within a virtual 
scenario and interact with a trigger (virtual object) in order to start the 
presentation of multimedia content (audio, video and image) inside this 
environment. 

3.2 Architecture 

The OGRE-Coder architecture is divided into five sub-modules: User Interface, Main 
Module, OGRE, XML-Manager and Multimedia Manager. Figure 3 illustrates the 
architecture of OGRE-Coder.

Fig. 3. Main architecture of OGRE-Coder 

As depicted in Figure 3, Main Module and Interface have a major role in the 
application. Main Module is responsible for the integration and coordination of all the 
other modules. Interface is responsible for receiving and handling all the user 
interactions. These two modules work in a coordinated way in order to respond to 
users interactions and to provide the presentation of the virtual environment. 

In particular, the Main Module can still be refined into 5 sub-modules, as 
illustrated in Figure 4(a): 



OGRE-Manager - module responsible for managing the user interactions, 

and initializing different components such as multimedia, scenario, data 

input and XML; 

Input Manager - module responsible for initializing the libraries related to 

the data input devices and events management (keyboard and mouse inputs); 

XML Manager - module responsible for managing the XML parsing 

requirements and the respective C# generation; 

Multimedia Initialization - responsible for initializing the multimedia 

libraries (audio and video), the definition of triggers and the execution of 

user interactions handlers, and; 

Scenario Initialization - module responsible for the initialization of all the 

objects which will be presented in the virtual scenario and for the definition 

of multimedia triggers.

Fig. 4. Main Module Architecture 

The XML Manager is responsible for reading the XML file indicated by the user, and 
for the automatic generation of its respective C# code. This module is depicted in 
Figure 4(b). This module is refined in the following sub-modules: 

â¢ XML Parser - component that carries out the parsing of the XML file, 
following the description of the virtual scenario, and storing its objects in 
typed lists. These objects can be of the type ambient, sky, object, camera, 
fag, etc.; 

â¢ Code Generation - component that provides different functionalities related 
to the automatic generation of C# code; 

â¢ C# - component that reads the lists provided by the XML parsing, and 
generates one object-oriented class for each type of object in the respective 
list; 

â¢ Code Compiler - component that compiles the description of the objects 
present in each class in order to create dlLs (dynamic-link libraries), and; 

â¢ DLL's - component that applies the dll's generated by the Code Compiler 
module in order to instantiate all the objects described by the C# classes for 
the visualization of the OGRE virtual scenario. 



The OGRE Module (depicted in Figure 3) represents the graphic engine OGRE which 
is the main module of the system being responsible for creating, managing and 
updating the tri-dimensional model. Briefly, this module is responsible for rendering 
and managing the presentation of the virtual environment. Further details on the 
OGRE's architecture and hierarchy of classes can be found in [1]. 

The Multimedia Manager Module is responsible for handling the multimedia 
presentation requests. These requests take place when the user interacts with a trigger 
object, which can be associated with any 3D object in the virtual scenario. As 
depicted in Figure 4(c), this module is composed of the following sub-modules: 



An Interoperable Environment for the Automatic Generation of OGRE Virtual Scenarios 17 

â¢ Event handler - component responsible for managing the events produced by 
the user interaction in order to trigger a multimedia presentation; 

â¢ Panels - component responsible for creating the visible panels where multimedia 
content (image and video) will be presented inside the virtual environment, and; 

â¢ Presentation Manager - component responsible for managing the 
multimedia presentation, begin and end of a media object presentation, 
presentation duration of each media object, panel management, etc. 

3.3 Implementation Tools 

OGRE-Coder has been implemented using Visual Studio C# 2008 [10]. Visual Studio 
is a software development environment created by Microsoft. This software is very 
flexible and allows creating from simple to more complex applications. 

Visual Studio proved to be an asset for the development of this application since 
some of its features enable a faster coding and debugging. 

Visual Studio 2008 C# allows the utilization of Visual .NET, C#, J# and ASP.NET, 
while providing the possibility to develop applications from scratch for different types 
of devices such as PCs, pocket PC and smart phones. 

4 OGRE-Coder Functionalities 

In this section we present some of the main functionalities of OGRE-Coder and we 
illustrate these functionalities with some snapshots of the application. 

The development of OGRE applications is in general a programming activity since 
all the code must be developed in C++ or C#. For this reason, the development 
process of these applications is rather complex and time consuming to the OGRE 
developer since he has to code all the virtual scenarios to be applied in his application. 

In order to facilitate the development of OGRE virtual scenarios a generic 
framework was proposed for promoting the interoperability among different OGRE 
authoring tools, and further automatic generation of the respective code with the

description of the virtual scenarios. This framework relies on the utilization of 
OGREML for the complete description of OGRE virtual scenarios. 

For instance, virtual scenarios can be created easily using OGRE-Creative Laboratory 
(OGRE-CL) [11], and by means of OGREML, be exported to Ogre Coder for the 
automatic generation of C# code, as illustrated in Figure 5. The integration of an authoring 
tool for the creation of virtual scenarios (OGRE-CL) with OGRE-Coder for the automatic 
generation of C# code will allow a more rapid prototyping of OGRE applications. 

Next section presents some characteristics of the authoring tool for OGRE virtual 
scenarios, OGRE-CL. 

4.1 Authoring OGRE Virtual Environments 

OGRE Creativity Laboratory (OGRE-CL) is an easy to use graphical tool for 
optimizing the creation of OGRE applications [11]. With this tool OGRE developers 
are able to quickly design the main virtual scenarios of his applications, being able to 
further generate the respective C# code related to the virtual scenarios conceived. 
Among its different functionalities, OGRE-CL allows the user to: create and manage a 
virtual scenario from scratch; configure parameters for the virtual environment 
(Ambient); add/remove mesh files; add and manage 3D objects; add multimedia 
content; allow conversation between different participants of a session, either by text 
message or by Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and; allow the distributed 
navigation between remote OGRE applications. 

OGRE-CL provides a simple interface for the composition of virtual scenarios 
based on OGRE. An important characteristic of OGRE-CL is that it relies on an 
extensible library of objects (meshes) that can be used to create the virtual scenarios. 
Some snapshots of OGRE-CL are depicted in Figure 6 (a) and (b). 




Fig. 6. Ogre Creative Laboratory (OGRE-CL) 



OGRE-CL is an optimal solution for OGRE developers since they can minimize 
the time for designing the graphical interface of their applications. With the utilization 
of OGREML, they can export the description of their virtual scenarios to OGRE- 
Coder to further generate automatically the respective OGRE code. 

As a case study, we applied OGRE-CL to create a thematic virtual scenario related 
to the undersea life. This scenario presents different 3D objects such as sunken boats, 
whales, fishes, sea stars, rocks, anchors, etc., as illustrated in Figure 6 (a) and (b). 



An Interoperable Environment for the Automatic Generation of OGRE Virtual Scenarios 19 

When this scenario is saved, it is stored as an OGREML file. This OGREML file 
and all of its respective files (meshes, materials, etc.) are stored in a directory 
structure which is used to provide interoperability between OGRE-CL and OGRE- 
ML, as illustrated in Figure 5. 

4.2 Generating OGRE Code with OGRE-Coder 

When the user executes OGRE-Coder and opens the OGREML file related to the 
virtual scenario he wishes to visualize and convert to OGRE code, the application will 
automatically generate all the C# code associated with this scenario, and also it will 
render this scenario in an OGRE window so that the user can verify the final graphical 
quality of his scenario, as depicted in Figure 7. 




Fig. 7. Visualization of a virtual scenario with OGRE-Coder 

OGRE-Coder also allows users to navigate within the virtual environment and to 
interact with all the objects during the visualization of it. Furthermore, the user is also 
able to interact (click) with some objects considered as triggers for multimedia 
presentation. If he clicks on these objects, the multimedia presentation is 
automatically started, as illustrated in Figure 8 (a) and (b). 





(a) (b) 

Fig. 8. Presentation of multimedia content with OGRE-Coder 



In general, OGRE-Coder provides a good performance for the visualization of 
virtual scenarios and automatic generation of their respective C# code. When applied 
jointly with OGRE-CL, these tools represent an expressive environment for the 
intuitive authoring of high-quality virtual environments supporting a variety of 3D 
models and textures.

5 Conclusions 

In this paper we presented the main aspects of the development of a useful tool for the 
rapid development of 3D scenarios, OGRE-Coder. An important contribution 
presented in this paper is the proposal of an XML-based language, called OGREML, 
for the complete description of OGRE virtual scenarios, and for promoting the 
interoperability among OGRE authoring tools. 

With the utilization of OGREML, OGRECL becomes an optimal solution for 
OGRE developers since they can minimize the time for designing the graphical 
interface of their applications, and after that they can apply OGRE-Coder to generate 
automatically the OGRE code related to his scenarios. This approach allows 
developers to quickly prototype the virtual scenarios of their OGRE Applications, 
concentrating their efforts on the development of the dynamic aspects of the 
application such as artificial intelligence, strategies, events handling, etc.

Abstract. This paper presents a project which introduces a novel concept and 
technical implementation of a video mediated collaboration system. The start- 
ing point was to provide tools suitable for professionals particularly in the field 
of design and engineering. The core of the concept is to create a permanent 
connection between two remote locations and to combine live video screen and 
interactive table surface. The aim is to use the best features of existing video- 
conferencing solutions, smart whiteboards and collaborative file sharing sys- 
tems. The technical solution is based on utilisation of existing components and 
low cost software. The first prototypes suggest that this type of system has more 
intuitive and natural user interface compared to current solutions. With future 
field testing the challenges concerning the application environment can be bet- 
ter met.

1 Current Systems for Enabling Remote Collaboration 

There are several tools facilitating video mediated communication over distance, 
ranging from carefully designed telepresence environments to desktop videoconfer- 
encing applications. Smart whiteboards and interactive table surfaces have also been 
introduced into the office environment. In the following, we briefly review these sys- 
tems, and point out some of the problems and limitations found in them. 

1.1 Videoconferencing and Telepresence Systems 

Videoconferencing systems have their historical background in videophone solutions. 
They have been developed as a visual version of a conventional telephone. Modern vid- 
eoconference solutions thus share the basic operational logic of a telephone, where a 
connection is established on user's request and terminated at the end of the discussion. 

Current systems have not been able to solve all challenges of having a viable video 
mediated collaboration environment. Full scale telepresence systems (e.g. Cisco, 
Polycom) feature carefully designed room environments with special lighting,

cameras, microphones and large displays [5, 15]. These systems usually have their 
own reserved internet connections and specific expensive hardware solutions to en- 
sure the stability and quality of the connection. 

Telepresence solutions may have accessibility problems [14]. Usually an organisa- 
tion has a limited amount of telepresence capable rooms, this may hinder collabora- 
tive work in general. Arranging meetings to telepresence room and establishing a 
video conference there also creates an extra step to the creative design process. Fur- 
thermore telepresence rooms are usually not suitable to any other kind of work than 
meetings. An environment created for executive level meetings does not encourage 
casual interaction. In design process it would be useful to be able to review a physical 
prototype and sketch new solutions together [4, 8]. 

1.2 Desktop Video Conferencing 

Laptops and modern smart phones with integrated web-cameras enable video calls 
and limited videoconferencing at nearly any location. One of the disadvantages is that 
current desktop videoconferencing setups are designed for individual use, and thus 
work poorly when there are several people by the same computer device. They also 
restrict the work to be conducted with the computer and do not encourage the use of 
conventional, not computer related working methods. Video, which represents the 
face of the remote user in a small display screen with low resolution and poor image 
quality restricts the modes and aspects of communication [1, 17]. 

Document sharing features of current desktop videoconferencing solutions and 
collaborative file sharing systems enable distributed work on the same document. 
However, they focus solely on digital documents and tools. This is considered as a 
limitation to work and forces users to use tools not entirely natural to them [8]. 

1.3 Interactive Tables and Smart Whiteboards 

Once the large LCD and Plasma computer displays became available in early 2000' s, 
there have been several interactive tables developed (Microsoft Surface, EyeBoard, 
Aurora, atracTable, Illuminate). Their most common use is viewing and using interac- 
tive multimedia for various purposes. The interactive surface of these devices is usu- 
ally horizontally positioned [2,3,9,10,13]. 

Smart whiteboards that enable the use of interactive multimedia are provided by 
several different companies, most commonly for education and business environ- 
ments [16,19,21]. 

There is also research and development of a smart whiteboard that enables collabo- 
rative work over distance, sharing tangible post-it notes and drawings [8]. 

All smart whiteboard solutions have the same limitations as ordinary whiteboards: 
they do not allow attaching objects on the vertical surface. In the worst case they can 
be used with an electronic pen only, which makes the drawing experience less natural. 
These boards are usually vertically positioned and allow digital content to be added 
via projector and the outcome to be captured as a digital image and in some systems 
shared with another similar device.

2 The Importance of Usability 

Usability is one of the main challenges of all existing videoconference systems. These 
systems are often found too complex and thus require training [1,6,14]. Even making 
a simple conference audio call requires some knowledge about telephone operator 
system. 

Videoconference systems vary and have dissimilar user interfaces [5, 15] which 
makes using them even more difficult. Establishing connections between different 
systems is in the worst case, impossible. All interruptions that are caused by the tech- 
nology are found to prevent the actual communication [1]. These problems may limit 
the overall use of videoconferencing. 

Videoconference systems should be designed to be intuitive and easy to use, so that 
any person without any specific training could operate them. Creating a connection 
with a videoconference system usually requires previous experience. Establishing a 
connection between two places should be as easy as making a conventional telephone 
call. Unfortunately, in many cases starting a videoconference can fail already at this 
stage [14]. 

More usability and technical challenges arise once the connection has been estab- 
lished. Poor quality nonsynchronous video and audio can cause problems in under- 
standing, turn taking etc. [11]. Sharing documents might require the use of some other 
system, which may have a completely different user interface [1]. 

We find that making the technology unnoticeable would be the easiest way to 
tackle these problems. Instead of concentrating on technical issues and problems users 
could focus on the actual work with the tools they prefer and are familiar with. 

3 Building Prototypes 

3.1 First Prototype 

This project started as an experiment to connect two Aalto University buildings lo- 
cated in remote campuses with a good quality live video link (Design Factory, Espoo 
and Industrial design programme, Helsinki). 

Our first prototype (see figure 1) was a high quality (FullHD) permanent video 
connection between these two locations. Both ends were connected to FUNET (Fin- 
nish University and Research Network) which allowed us to use 50 Mbit (25 Mbit in / 
25 Mbit out) bandwidth. During this experiment we found out that our system had 
used as much data bandwidth as the rest of our campus. This connection was round 
the clock sending unpacked raw camera data directly through the network using 
DVTS [7] for WindowsXP and receiving it in the other end by using the same soft- 
ware. The first prototype was used for a period of six months. 

The purpose of this system was to connect design professionals and trainees, and 
therefore system providing only live video connection was considered to be too lim- 
ited. Collaboration between these two locations required more than a permanent video 
connection. This gave us an idea of a simple interactive table that could serve as a 
shared drawing board.

3.2 Second Prototype 



In the second prototype we added another video connection for the table, still main- 
taining the first video connection (see figure 2). Since the first prototype required too 
much bandwidth to be feasible, we started experimenting with Skype [18]. The use of 
Linux operating system enabled us to control Skype using Python programming lan- 
guage. We were able to create an automatically re-connecting system, eliminating the 
need of all user intervention. In addition, Linux was considered more stable operating 
system than WindowsXP. 

One prototype unit consisted of two desktop PCs and two displays installed to a single 
casing that had wheels. The casing was required to hide the computers and their controls 
completely. Furthermore this casing allowed embedding the monitor to the table surface, 
mounting the screen for video connection and installing all necessary cameras.

Table surface consisting a monitor was plated with glass that enabled drawing on it 
with whiteboard markers and supporting objects placed on top of it. Camera was in- 
stalled above the table surface capturing the table top. Two identical copies of this 
setup were constructed to be used in field studies later. 

As we found that our interactive table surface requires a higher resolution than 
Skype can provide, we plan to replace Skype with a set of Linux programs better 
suited for this kind of application. We also plan using video cameras equipped with 
better optics, offering higher image quality compared to current webcams. 



4 Our Design Concept 

Our concept combines a high quality video and audio connection on large vertical 
screen and horizontal high resolution large video table, see figure 3. This table can be 
used as a shared whiteboard and surface that can transfer image of any object that is 
placed on it to remote location and vice versa. Information can be shared just by 
drawing directly on the table surface or placing an object on to the table (i.e. IPad, 
smartphone, laptop, paper, coffee cup, scale model).

4.1 Permanent Connection, Invisible User Interface 



In the era where Internet connections allow users to access digital media around the 
clock, establishing video calls separately for each discussion can be considered old 
fashioned. Creating a permanent connection removes this user task. 

We propose that the video and audio connection is active all the time which elimi- 
nates the problem of establishing a connection. Consequently, the conventional user 
interface becomes unnecessary and can be hidden from the user. Users are able to fo- 
cus on their collaborative work intuitively, naturally and without struggling with 
technology. The solution resembles the philosophy of ubiquitous computing where 



26 J. Manner and J. -P. Virtanen 

the user needs no longer focus on using a computer system, but simply performs the 
normal tasks, while the computer facilitates them on the background [6,20]. 

Having non-stop video connection in office environment changes the whole culture 
of collaborative video mediated work from formal meeting to an informal gathering 
around a coffee table. 

4.2 Natural Collaborative Tools 

In creative collaboration, drawing and writing to a shared table with regular white- 
board pens is more intuitive than using mice, cursors or computer drawing tablets. 
Our interactive table allows the use of these tools in video mediated collaboration. 

Sharing information by placing it on a table is less complicated than scanning in 
documents, sharing them via file sharing systems and struggling with different soft- 
ware incompatibilities. Intuitive tools and working methods also remove the need of 
any system training. 

5 Discussion 

5.1 Is Permanent Connection Too Limited? 

Our concept is useful if there is a constant need of communication between two 
locations. By eliminating the "call function" we remove the possibility of making in- 
dividual video calls to more rarely contacted recipients. The proposed system cannot 
completely replace current videoconferencing systems. Are the usability requirements 
met closely enough to justify the existence of partially overlapping systems? Could 
the development of an intuitive connecting interface solve this problem? 

5.2 Where Could This Concept Be Applied? 

The potential use-cases of the proposed system include remote offices, established 
subsidiaries and other long-time partners of organisations. There are also other situa- 
tions where easy video communication could be applied, that haven't been at 
the scope of development of current video conferencing systems i.e. a live connection 
from your local restaurant to a restaurant in Athens as new interior decoration 
element. 

5.3 Challenges of Permanent Video Connections 

One of the potential problems in permanent video connections is privacy. Research 
has been conducted on video communication systems in home environments. One of 
the challenges found has been defining which areas are shared by the video communi- 
cation system, which are private, and how this is indicated [12]. 

Closed videoconferencing environments ensure privacy, but also create accessibil- 
ity problems. If open videoconferencing is introduced to the office environment, it 
may cause privacy issues. Therefore the video communication areas should be clearly 
indicated, so that they can be avoided if necessary. 



Natural and Intuitive Video Mediated Collaboration 27 

Permanent live video connection wastes bandwidth when nothing is happening in 
the viewed area. Implementing software based motion detection to activate data trans- 
fer when persons appear into field of camera would prevent sending data in vain. 

5.4 Future Development Challenges 

The overall concept and the implementation should be tested with the users in the 
field. This would enable further study of potential problems regarding usability, pri- 
vacy and technical aspects. Through extensive field testing it can be verified whether 
the proposed system genuinely supports video mediated collaboration and social in- 
teraction when compared to existing solutions.

Abstract. Evolutionary algorithms are heuristic techniques for finding 
approximate solutions of hard optimization and adaptation problems. 
Due to their ability to create innovative solutions, evolutionary algo- 
rithms are very well suited for applications in the domain of art. In this 
paper the system supporting human composer in the process of music 
composition with the use of evolutionary algorithm is presented. The ar- 
chitecture of the system as well as implemented algorithms and results 
of selected experiments will be presented. 



1 Introduction 

Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are heuristic techniques for finding approximate 
solutions of hard optimization and adaptation problems 2]. The evolutionary 
algorithms can be applied to many different problems, like multi-modal opti- 
mization, multi-objective optimization, combinatorial optimization, etc. 

Because of their ability to explore huge solution spaces and to generate/ 
propose new and original (previously not even known to experts in the field) 
solutions to the given problems they can be applied in domains which require 
innovative approaches and creativeness, for example designing of engineering 
components, architecture, etc. Such capabilities were supposed to belong only to 
the human beings but the evolutionary algorithms demonstrate that computer 
program can also be creative and propose new, so far unexplored or unknown, 
solutions and even create art. One of the domains of art in which the evolution- 
ary algorithms can support (or compete with) humans is the process of music 
composition. This paper presents one of the possible approaches to support the 
human composer. 

Almost every musician is to some extent skeptical about the concept of using 
machines (computers) in the process of music composition â of course what we 
mean here is not using electronic musical instruments or some software support- 
ing the process of music composition by the human composer, but composing 
musical pieces by computer itself. Probably something like complete replacement 
of the human composer with some music software or hardware in the process of 
music composition is impossible. However, humans can easily interact with the 
system (especially when we use evolutionary algorithms) and guide the process 
of music composition.

There have already appeared several approaches to supporting music com- 
position with the use of evolutionary algorithms. J. A. Biles is the author of 
GcnJam â system for generating jazz solos on the basis of input data from MIDI 
interface [3|,|4|. Gen Jam was generating sample bars or phrases, which then were 
presented to the so called "mentor" who was assigning them htness values. 

B. Budzyski in his work [5] presented different approach to music composition 
with the use of evolutionary algorithms. There was no input data â initial pop- 
ulation was generated at random. There was also human factor present during 
evolution, but composer decided only whether to continue or to stop the evolu- 
tion process â music pieces were evaluated automatically, since there existed the 
fitness function. 

Tree-based representation for musical pieces and the appropriate mutation 
operator was proposed in [l[. 

Authors of [6[ proposed Harmony Search Algorithm. Musical composition 
was generated on the basis of vectors of notes improvised by n musical instru- 
ments. These vectors were classified on the basis of intervals between theme and 
variations. 

R. De Prisco and R. Zaccagnino presented the idea of bass harmonization 
with the use of genetic algorithm [95 . Their system took bass line as the input 
and on its basis generated three additional voices. 

In this paper we will present evolutionary system supporting music 
composition â EvoMusComp. We will use different approach than those pre- 
sented above. Firstly, in the presented system user can generate the whole new 
piece of music, or variation on chosen theme, with the use of evolutionary algo- 
rithm. User can interact with the system by setting values of parameters and 
stopping the process of evolution. The music pieces are evaluated with the use of 
fitness function, which is constructed from several components by the user at the 
beginning of evolution. In the following sections we will describe the architecture 
of the system, evolutionary algorithm used to generate the music and selected 
results of preliminary experiments. 



2 Evolutionary System Supporting Music Composition 

In this section we will describe the architecture of the evolutionary system sup- 
porting music composition (EvoMusComp) as well as the genetic algorithm used 
for music generation. 

2.1 Architecture of the System 

The implemented evolutionary system supporting music composition is based on 
the Java technology. The eclipse RCP platform was used to create user interface 
(see Fig. [Taj) . 

Basic components of the system are presented in the Fig. [lb] System compo- 
nent is responsible for merging information and controlling the information flow

2.2 Genetic Algorithm 

The general structure of the evolutionary algorithm used in the system is based 
on the well known J. Holland's and D. Goldberg's genetic algorithm |2fl. 

In the classical genetic algorithm the binary representation is used in order to 
represent the encoded solution. In the genetic algorithm used in the presented 
system such representation is adapted to the music notes description. 

The attributes of the Genotype class, that represents the genotype of individ- 
uals include: 

â¢ name â String type â represents the name of the note in the specific octave; 

â¢ octave â integer type â represents the octave that the note is in. In the algo- 
rithm it takes values from the range 3 to 7, depending on the key signature; 

â¢ noteKind â double type â represents the duration of the note. Acceptable val- 
ues are: 1.0 (whole note), 0.5 (half note), etc. 

In many research papers in the area of music composition, the structure of the 
chromosome is based on the single voice line. In the implemented system, the 
chromosome is built from n-elements voice array. This construction allows to 
compose not only one voice melodies, but also the whole phrase, or even whole 
piece of polyphonic music. 

There are two implemented genetic operators: crossover and mutation. Below 
we will describe them in more details because they are quite different from the 
standard operators used in genetic algorithms. 

The recombination operator was implemented as one-point crossover. When 
we try to exchange genes from the one chromosome with the genes from the 
other chromosome there may appear some problems. We can face the situation 
when the new chromosomes, created after the crossover, can be invalid.

Such situation is illustrated in the Fig. [21 The example shows that there 
is no note in the second chromosome in the place where the random point is 
placed before performing crossover. The sum of the notes' duration in the new 
chromosome would be longer or shorter than allowed.

Fig. 3. First (a) and second (b) chromosome after crossover 



Such error has to be fixed by changing the border note's values â it is shown 
in the Fig. [3J 

There are three variants of mutation, which can be chosen by the user: 

â¢ basic â value of a note is changed half tone up or down; 

â¢ extend â two neighboring notes are joined; 

â¢ split â one note is split into two notes. 

The probability of applying the mutation operator is also set by the user. The 
basic mutation of sample chromosome is shown in the Fig. [4j 
There arc three selection methods implemented in the system: 

â¢ roulette selection; 

â¢ tournament selection; 

â¢ ranking selection. 



Evolutionary System Supporting Music Composition 33 




Fig. 4. Chromosome before (a) and after (b) mutation 

As the result of applying of each of the above mechanisms the next generation 
consists of the same number of chromosomes (the number of the individuals in 
the population is constant). 

There are three basic components of the fitness function, in which user can: 

â¢ define preferred kind of note and distance between neighboring notes; 

â¢ define harmony functions; 

â¢ define the chromosome that will serve as a reference point for the adaptation 
function. 

With the use of the first and the second component we can compose a com- 
pletely new piece of music, but with the use of the third one, the user is able to 
compose a music variation on a given theme. 

2.3 The Process of Music Composition 

The process of music composing with the use of implemented system is illustrated 
in the Fig. \5[ First, we define parameters connected with the music notation:

measure count and key signature. Then parameters of the evolutionary algorithm 
are set. Evolutionary algorithm can be interrupted by the user and parameters 
can be modified interactively. 

3 Experimental Results 

In this section we will present the results of experiments carried out with the use 
of system presented in the previous section. The experiments were conducted in 
order to verify whether the system generates sensible results (music pieces) and 
which operators (and to what extent) give more satisfying results. 

The results of this experiments are very promising. With the use of imple- 
mented system user can create an original piece of music. With the given melody 
or music fragment (theme) one can also compose the variation. 

We can also mix settings of the system. At the beginning we can start compos- 
ing using some basic parameters describing specific kind of note and preferred 
distance between notes. Then we can take satisfying results as a basis chromo- 
some, which will be used in the next part of the music composition process as a 
reference point. If we want to extend our composition with an extra voice that 
wasn't specified at the beginning and restart the process of evolution, we can do 
it easily. So the implemented system is quite flexible and can serve as a composer 
of completely new pieces of music or variations on the given theme. Also the user 
can interact with the system during the process of music composition. 

During experiments different aspects were taken into consideration. One of 
them was the question whether the algorithm is able to generate reasonable 
results when it runs completely without the user intervention (changing values 
of parameters) for a given number of steps. Such experiments were conducted 
with all three selection mechanisms implemented. The results are presented in 
the Fig. O The whole experiment was carried out with the parameters' values 
shown in the Table [T] (column selection mechanism).

The results show that when there is no user interaction the greater number 
of steps for which the evolutionary algorithm is run do not necessary increase 
the value of the fitness function when tournament selection is used. In the case 
of the other two selection mechanisms there is a little progress only during the 
first 10 steps. These results show that interaction with the user is necessary â the 
best way of music composing with the use of evolutionary algorithm is to run it 
for a few steps, then stop the algorithm, modify the values of some parameters 
and resume the run of algorithm. 

The number of individuals present in the population has usually two contra- 
dictory effects. Better results are obtained when the population is larger, but it 
of course slows down computations. The influence of the number of individuals 
in the population on the time of computations is presented in the Fig. [7J Val- 
ues of parameters used during these experiments are presented in the Table Q] 
(column time of computations).

The influence of mutation probability on the quality of obtained results is 
shown in the Fig. \E\ Values of parameters used during these experiments are 
presented in the Table [1] (column mutation probability). It can be observed that 
mutation is very important operator in the presented system. Without mutation 
there is stagnation in the population. Aggressive mutation (p = 0.2) causes that 
better solutions appear in the population.

can be seen in the Fig. [Â§J Presented piece of music is the generated variation

4 Summary and Conclusions 

In this paper we have presented the system that can support the user (composer) 
during the process of music composition. The system can compose completely 
new pieces of music or generate variations on the given theme. 

User can interact with the evolutionary algorithm during initial phase, by 
setting the values of parameters and by constructing fitness function from the 
given set of components. User can also interrupt the process of evolution at 
the selected moment, change the values of some parameters and continue the 
evolution. As presented experiments show the obtained results are much better 
when user interacts with the system during its run. 

Preliminary experiments are quite promising â the system is able to generate 
completely new pieces of music or variations on the given theme, as it was 
presented in the previous sections. Future work will be focused on adding an 
expert system component which will play the role of human expert during music 
composition.

Abstract. It is argued that a social network can support knowledge transfer to 
its members with an informal way. It is also argued that a usable, in terms of 
HCI, social network can do this effectively and efficiently. Therefore, usability 
evaluation is a significant process that social networks, especially the 
education-oriented ones, have to undergo in order to be widely accepted and 
accomplish the task of knowledge transfer. This paper presents a methodology 
for the usability evaluation of social networks, that was applied to 
HOU2LEARN, an open educational social network setup in Hellenic Open 
University for educational and research purposes. The application of this 
methodology to HOU2LEARN is described and the evaluation results and 
outcomes are discussed. 

Keywords: Informal learning, social networks, usability, heuristic evaluation. 



1 Introduction 

Granted the pervasiveness of informal learning, the latter is supported by social 
networks which are widely accepted along with the Web 2.0 proliferation. Informal 
learning occurs by interaction, sharing ideas, creating content, making new contacts 
and engagement in critical thinking [14, 21]. Such activities within a social network 
offer experiences to the users while providing them knowledge in an informal way. 
Hellenic Open University (HOU), in order to face the challenge of open education 
through innovative methods, has set up HOU2LEARN (H2L); an open educational 
platform that aims to identify the learning outcomes that the members gain through 
their activities. 

H2L, as every environment that is used for educational purposes, has an increased 
demand, providing activities in an effective and efficient way, making the user feel 
engaged while interacting with it. To that extend, a usability evaluation may reveal 
usability issues that can be taken into consideration in a future redesign of the 
platform. In this paper, a detailed usability evaluation method, regarding H2L, is 
presented. More specifically, the heuristic evaluation method employed, was based on 
Nielsen's 10 heuristic rules [17], as well as on five additional heuristics specifically 
created, for such educational platforms, taking into consideration numerous studies 
using various heuristics. In the case of H2L, the main concern was on the usability of

its interface and not the learnability issues (as was the case in the majority of the 
studies considered). In brief, the evaluation depicted some aesthetic issues and some 
problems regarding the menus design and the navigation supported. 

Section 2 includes a brief literature review that summarizes the theoretical 
background and the relation between informal learning, Web 2.0 and social networks. 
The special issues of learning platforms regarding usability are also discussed. In 
Section 3, a detailed description of the H2L platform including objectives and features 
is presented. In Section 4, the evaluation methodology is presented along with the five 
additional heuristics. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the results of the methodology 
application in the case of H2L. 

2 Literature Review 

Researchers in the field of education acknowledge that informal learning is a 
significant element of education for learners of all ages [3, 21]. While formal learning 
needs an organised and structured environment, informal learning has a pervasive 
nature; it is integrated with daily routines related to work, family or leisure with no 
limits regarding age or institutional structure. It is a low conscious activity of the 
learner that may be initiated by both internal and external triggers. It doesn't require 
any kind of structure or organizational support in terms of time and learning as it may 
occur by chance [14, 15]. Furthermore, while in formal learning, knowledge transfer 
takes place through teaching, in informal learning it takes place through experience 
catching and compiling; Davies [4] advocates that a range of learning stimulated by 
general interests which is "caught, not taught" is also involved in informal learning. 
Learning by linking to others also results informal learning, given that the latter is an 
inductive process of reflection and action [14]. 

In reference to experience catching, a current trend Web 2.0 is a great source of 
experiences for the user. The user is in control of the content, by being not any more a 
passive receiver/consumer of information but takes the role of being the actor who 
publishes his content by himself and also expresses freely [6]. The social aspect of 
Web 2.0 had a significant impact on the way people connected to each other and led 
to the bloom of social networks. Using social networks, users collaborate with each 
other through a variety of group interactions, exchanging information and experience 
with other users, while sharing ideas, thoughts and interests [23]. The accessibility to 
and the engagement in social networks have accepted a strong influence by the 
development and the proliferation of Web 2.0 technologies [14]. It is indicative that 
one of the most popular social networks, Facebook, has over 500 million active users 
who spend over 700 billion minutes per month as logged-in users [9]. 

The activities that a social network provides to the user, are based on three 
different axes [14]: a. Personal Profile: The social network permits the user to share 
personal information - in the level he wishes - through his profile, letting him decide 
how and which kind of this information will be visible to other users, b. 
Networking: The social network allows the user to connect with other users of the 
network, who might be already known as friends or just as contacts and initiate or join 
sub-sets of user groups based on common interests or pursuits, c. Content: The social 
network enables the user to interact with the content, i.e. to create, upload, tag and 



Usability Inspection of Informal Learning Environments: The HOU2LEARN Case 41 

share multimedia content that he has created and link other users to a variety of web- 
accessible content. 

A social network fundamentally enhances information sharing, ideas and thoughts 
exchange, communication and thus experience assembling. It is evident that informal 
learning is facilitated by social networks and these networks are a medium that 
transfers knowledge in an informal way [14]. In order knowledge to be transferred in 
an effective and efficient way, usability issues of such environments should be deeply 
investigated, as interfaces with educational aspects are the medium for this kind of 
knowledge transfer and cannot be considered as a common interface. In order to focus 
to the medium, Feldestein [10] isolates usability from learnability issues and 
advocates that usability in learning interfaces concerns the way the content is 
presented and not just the content solely. Furthermore, for Zaharias et al. [29] an 
instructional interface should allow the user to focus on learning content rather than 
focusing on how to access it. 

3 The HOU2LEARN Platform 

HOU, in the context of software quality research, has set up H2L, an open educational 
social environment. H2L has been set up in order to monitor the correlation among 
Learning 2.0 challenges, social networking activities and informal learning. H2L has 
launched in September 2010, and is part of a wider ongoing research on informal 
learning environments under the auspices of Software Quality Research Group of the 
HOU. 

H2L is powered by Elgg, an award-winning open source social networking engine, 
delivering the building blocks that enable educational or business bodies to create 
their own social networks and applications. It was the software of choice after an 
extensive evaluation of the Web 2.0 characteristics of existing learning environments 
[24] as well as its user base and existing community contributing to the project. H2L 
has been set up in 2010, and it is initially promoted by HOU to the students of the 
postgraduate course "MSc in Information Systems". H2L is running in combination 
with the "traditional" e-learning environments (i.e. Moodle, LAMS, IBM Lotus 
Learning Sametime) that HOU uses in the context of the open and distance education 
principles. It is vital to note that both tutors and students have the same access rights 
and this aims to enforce the informal aspect of the platform. 

There are three main objectives of the H2L environment. First is to promote 
openness regarding content creation and sharing in an informal environment. This less 
typical kind of environment, makes students feel more comfortable to create and share 
content without the stress of competition or making an error. The second is to enhance 
communication among the members in a less formal way. This aims to create 
connections with members who share common educational and research interests. The 
third objective is to promote socialization among the members, as socialization 
potentially endorses the exchange of ideas and experience, and therefore the 
establishment of an informal way of learning. From scientific perspective and within a 
long term of use, H2L intends to investigate the knowledge transfer procedure, the 
assessment of knowledge acquired through such an informal environment and the 



42 



E. Koulocheri et al. 



revelation of strong and weak parts of environments for informal learning based on 
social networks. 

Moreover the activities within H2L can be classified into the following three 
categories/axes: a. Personalization which refers to the ability of users to create their 
profile as well as their personal ePortfolio, b. Networking which refers to the ability of 
users to follow the activities of other users and create or join groups of users with 
common interests or ideas. Moreover it is interoperable with other social networks 
such as Facebook and microblogging tools such as Twitter, c. Content which refers to 
the ability of users to customize the content presented in their dashboard through 
various widgets (small sub applications). 

Another important feature of H2L is that most of the activities provide RSS for 
content syndication. This allows members of H2L to stay attuned to the latest feeds 
and along with RSS, enabling publish events directly to their Facebook or Twitter 
accounts. Pushing out content in such ways, promotes openness as well as ideas and 
experience exchange, leading to a holistic approach of Informal Learning through 
Web 2.0. The following figures depict the H2L login page (Fig.l) and a sample of a 
H2L dashboard (Fig. 2):

4 Usability Evaluation 



4.1 General 



Having presented H2L and before going into its evaluation details, it is vital to define 
usability. The ISO 9241-11 [11] defines usability as "the extent to which a product 
can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency 
and satisfaction in a specified context of use" . This definition poses three parameters: 
Effectiveness, that inquires how accurately and completely user achieves specific 
goals, Efficiency, that measures the resources expanded in relation to the accuracy 
and completeness with which user achieves goals, and Satisfaction that is related to 
the freedom from discomfort, the willingness to reuse it and positive attitudes towards 
the use of the system [13]. 

According to Nielsen [16], usability is described by answering five fundamental 
questions, as following: 1 . How easily and fast can the user learn the system? 2. Is the 



Usability Inspection of Informal Learning Environments: The HOU2LEARN Case 43 

system efficient to use? 3. Is the system easy to remember after some period of not 
having used it, and how much memory load does its usage require? 4. Does the 
system have a low error rate and how easily can the user recover from errors? 5. Does 
the user feel satisfaction -even subjectively satisfaction- by the system usage? 

Many methods that measure usability have been developed. These methods require 
various resources (various numbers of users, users with different level of skills, 
equipment etc.), they are employed on various phases of the software life-cycle and 
they are applied in usability laboratory environments or as field studies. In the case of 
H2L, the method employed was the heuristic evaluation; Heuristic evaluation is a 
method based on a structured critique of a system using a set of relatively simple and 
general heuristics (i.e. guidelines or general principles or rules that can be used to 
critique a decision that has been taken or to guide a design decision) [5]. The main 
reason that this method has been chosen for the evaluation of H2L, lies in the fact that 
is a well-established method providing good results with relatively low resources (it is 
usually called "discount" method) [16]. Furthermore, this method can be applied to 
systems that are already operational such as H2L. Heuristic evaluation requires a 
number or 3 to 5 usability experts who, according to Nielsen [16] can reveal 75% of 
the overall usability problems. These experts (evaluators) judge the system under 
evaluation, checking whether it complies with the established usability principles 
mentioned above. Evaluators also use their own experience and point of view 
regarding the system they inspect. 

4.2 The Method Applied 

Heuristic evaluation is conducted in two phases [2, 5, 13, 22]: a. Overall inspection: 
The evaluator navigates through the interface for several minutes in order to get 
familiar with it, as well as with the flow of the interaction and the general scope of the 
system, and b. Focused inspection: The evaluator goes through the interface several 
times, inspecting various dialog elements. Usually, he is asked by the usability 
coordinator to follow a scenario and this facilitates the whole process. While the 
evaluator executes the scenario, he compares the system's behavior with the list of 
heuristics and notes any violation in an evaluation form. 

A list of heuristics that fit into the majority of web-based systems and provide an 
effective coverage of the most common usability problems [5], has been suggested by 
Nielsen and Mack [17] as follows: 

1. Visibility of system status 

2. Match between system and the real world 

3. User control and freedom 

4. Consistency and standards 

5. Error prevention 

6. Recognition rather than recall 

7. Flexibility and efficiency of use 

8. Aesthetic and minimalistic design 

9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors 

10. Help and documentation 



44 E. Koulocheri et al. 

At this point, it is vital to note that this list is not static; Researchers in the field of 
usability [5, 16, 22] advocate that it can be modified depending on the domain of the 
system under evaluation. 

Therefore, in order to "customize" the evaluation according the three axes that an 
open educational social platform such as H2L is based on, and taking into 
consideration numerous evaluation studies using various heuristics [1, 8, 12, 18, 19, 
20, 25, 26, 27] the abovementioned list has been enriched with five additional 
heuristics (specifically created for the usability evaluation of e-learning platforms): 

11. Customisation: Customisation of the content: The presentation of the content 
should be accomplished through multiple ways, contributing to a customization, 
without confusing the user, however. Content should be provided with alternative 
forms and all representations and metaphors should be meaningful while the transition 
from one form to the other should be performed with a simple and visible way. 
Customisation of the platform: The platform should make user feel free to change the 
settings according his preferences, giving thus, a personal "look and feel" in the user 
interface. This heuristic also checks if the platform allows user to present and manage 
his personal profile effectively, having the control of what is published and to whom. 

12. Navigation: This heuristic rule checks if the navigation in platform is 
conducted with a clear and comprehensive way. User should be able to know at any 
instant where he is and where he can go to. Ideally, the system should inform him 
visually, on the available option he has. Furthermore, navigation should be supported 
with fidelity; the representation of elements of real world and the provision of 
complicated options should be controlled. Lack of fidelity may lead to user attention 
destruction and consequently user disorientation. 

13. Interactivity: Interaction with the content: The platform should support 
interactivity between user and content, with a clear but pervasive way. It should be 
obvious that the content is dynamic and everyone can contribute to its creation 
whenever he wishes to. Platform should allow the community of users to create 
content jointly, promoting thus, collaborative learning, while it provides all 
interaction options in the right location on the interface. Interaction with peers: In an 
open social platform, interaction with peers contributes to the ideas and experiences 
sharing. Therefore, it should be provided effectively and unobstructedly giving the 
user the feeling that he deals not only with the content but with a community of users 
ready to connect and collaborate with him. 

14. Tools and Multimedia integration: This heuristic rule judges how easy is the 
installation of new tools and widgets that will increase interactivity both with content 
and in peers. The platform should allow user to manage the tools changing their 
location on the user interface. Furthermore, the platform should be efficiently and 
effectively integrate external media and tools allowing content exporting. 

15. Motivation - Engagement: In order to keep a social network alive, user should 
feel satisfaction while interacting with it, engagement so as to use it for long time and 
motivation so as to use it actively. Therefore, through multiple but discreet ways, 
platform should encourage users to be actively logged in for longer. 



Usability Inspection of Informal Learning Environments: The HOU2LEARN Case 45 

4.3 The Experiment 

During the evaluation of H2L, 4 evaluators were involved; 2 of them were usability 
experts with more than 7-year scientific experience in the domain and the rest of them 
had significant experience in heuristic evaluation. In order to avoid biased results, 
evaluators did not have any previous experience with H2L platform (setting up or 
interaction with the platform) before the evaluation. 

Prior to the evaluation, the coordinator of the process, made an oral, brief 
presentation of the H2L, and distributed the evaluation scenario to each evaluator. 
The scenario had been designed by the usability coordinator is such way, so as the 
evaluation lasted between one and two hours for each evaluator. The scenario was 
also divided into three sections following the three axes (Personal 
profiling/Personalisation, Networking, Content) aforementioned. 

The evaluators were encouraged to follow the tasks of the scenario and to validate 
the implementation of each heuristic rule. Each time a heuristic rule was violated, the 
evaluator identified the part of the scenario where the violation occurred, keeping 
notes in an evaluation form. 

The couple of usability experts reported 23 and 19 usability problems respectively, 
that lead to 41 and 41 violations of the heuristic rules. The other two evaluators 
detected 19 and 12 problems respectively that lead to 33 and 27 violations. 52% of the 
reported problems were reported by more than one evaluator. Considering these 
duplications as a single problem, the aggregation of the evaluation forms, shows a 
total number of 35 usability issues that correspond to 68 violations of the heuristic 
rules, as the following table depicts:

Hereinafter, a number of characteristic usability issues per heuristic rule are 
presented and discussed: 

1. Visibility of system status: The evaluators mentioned that the system didn't 
inform them about the progress of file uploading. Furthermore, when they visited a 
page of another user, they found that the "Follow this Person" button is not 
adequately visible and easy to find. 

2. Match between the system and the real world: For the evaluators, it was not 
clear the difference between "Dashboard" and "Home". "Tools" is not an indicative 
term as it represents a menu, in fact. The "Tools" drop down menu and the menu next 
to "Home" include the same terms that they don't lead to the same actions, however. 
Moreover, the term "Wire post" is reported to be unfamiliar. Another problem 
detected is that the envelope icon that leads to the user inbox is not visible enough and 
this obstructs communication among the members. 

3. User control and freedom: In general, H2L doesn't limit the user control, but a 
major problem reported by the evaluators, was the lack of "Back" button. 



46 E. Koulocheri et al. 

4. Consistency and standards: In this case, the evaluators found that "Home" 
button should be placed in a more usual place, such as up and left next to the 
"Dashboard". Furthermore, some actions do not lead to the same result; Clicking on a 
"Following" icon sometimes leads to his profile page and sometimes to content that 
he has created. 

5. Error preventions: The evaluators didn't report any problem related to lack of 
error prevention. 

6. Recognition rather than recall: For some actions, H2L requires some memory 
load as the evaluation reports showed; "ePortfolio" was expected to be in personal 
profile page. "Tools" is an 11 -level dropdown menu with a structure similar but not 
the same as the menu that is next to "Home". Furthermore, it is not mentioned which 
menu tab is active. 

7. Flexibility and efficiency of use: The evaluators reported lack of efficiency when 
integrating locked Twitter accounts. They also mentioned that "Dashboard" and 
"Tools" menu are not visible, decreasing flexibility. Moreover, problems on searching 
new contacts decrease efficiency on networking. 

8. Aesthetic and minimalistic design: The evaluators found that upper menus 
design is not clearly visible and furthermore, it is unnecessary to divide the menu into 
two parts "Dashboard" etc on the left, and "Home" etc on the right. Some buttons 
such as the "Publish" buttons and some menu icons that appear as a column on the 
content creation pages don't have a uniform style confusing, thus, the user. 

9. Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors: The only problem 
reported regarding help recovering from errors is that no help provided when setting 
up a locked Twitter account as already mentioned before. 

10. Help and documentation: The evaluators remarked that within H2L, the word 
"Help" is missing. They reported that some support was expected, especially during 
tasks that they couldn't perform. Furthermore, the search tool for finding contacts 
didn't work with a consistent way. 

11. Customization of the content: The evaluators reported that the "Edit" link on 
the "Home" page was confusing as it doesn't lead to content creation as expected. 
They also reported that any customization related to contacts, such as notifications 
settings, was expected to be found on every contact's page. The choices of the right 
menu ("Home") provide content in a different way as the "Tools" menu does, but they 
reported that this should be presented in a more clear way. 

12. Navigation: After login, it wasn't clear for the evaluators, which page was open 
as there was not such a navigational indication. They expected the "Home" to be the 
anchor-page. Moreover, none of the evaluators managed to find the page which 
includes all latest feeds, remarking that the navigation options are not of much 
assistance, due to the division of the menu options into the left and the right part. 

13. Interactivity: The evaluators expected that interaction among contents to be 
more active; in some cases, contacts' usernames didn't appear through mouse-over 
and sometimes, options for networking were not visible. The problems with contacts 
searching, influenced interactivity among users, as the evaluators advocated. 

14. Tools and multimedia integration: The evaluators reported the lack of 
efficiency in the integration of non-public Twitter accounts; Dialogue boxes with 
technical terms were poped-up. 



Usability Inspection of Informal Learning Environments: The HOU2LEARN Case 47 

75. Motivation-Engagement: In general, the evaluators mentioned that they felt 
engaged to use the H2L platform, but they reported that the aforementioned problems 
related to networking facilities, influenced their motivation. 

5 Conclusions - Future Goals 

This paper presented the process and the results of the heuristic evaluation of an 
education-oriented social network platform named HOU2LEARN. The results of the 
conducted heuristic evaluation presented 35 usability problems. The heuristic rules 
that were used, were modified in order to cover the specific axes that social networks 
are based on. The rules were presented, along with the applied methodology 
description. The evaluation revealed lack of visibility for networking actions, as well 
as help support and documentation. Furthermore, it seems necessary to reposition the 
menus in a more concise way and rename of some menu options. Some navigation 
problems detected and need to be taken into consideration in a future redesign of 
H2L. 

As a future work, on-going research of a further usability evaluation using a more 
objective method, such as eye-tracking, will lead to the comparison and integration of 
the results of these different methods. The usability team of the Software Quality 
Research Group of the Hellenic Open University will aggregate the findings of these 
two methods, and propose solutions, contributing to the enhancement of the H2L 
usability. From learning perspective, it is planned to quantize and assess the informal 
learning "produced" through such an environment, aiming to show that a usable 
informal learning environment such as H2L is able to provide knowledge that can be 
assessed even through formal procedures.

Abstract. The realistic trees modeling is required in many virtual systems such 
as architecture modeling packages, widely spread simulators and computer 
games, large-scale realistic maps in geographic information systems (GIS), and 
also 3D-modeling packages of landscapes and forest monitoring. Existing 
L-system (even stochastic L-systems) considers a growing effect without de- 
generating artifacts that leads to closely visual results when all trees are looked 
like as a sample. We suggest a procedural approach including an initial chose 
procedure, a growing procedure, and a degenerating procedure. Also we discuss 
an influence of some weather conditions and forest modeling for improvement 
of virtual results. We use the main advantage of L-systems (a quick process 
of 3D-visual "growing") and achieve a reality visualization in landscape 
applications. 



1 Introduction 

The design of 3D-objects of growth is one of complex modeling tasks because of 
geometrically complex structures and great amount of growth kinds. Existing methods 
of trees modeling are classified into two wide categories: (1) methods used on an ini- 
tial set of 2D images, and (2) methods based on mathematical rules of object genera- 
tion. In the first case the modeling process is divided into three stages: receiving of 
object's images, segmentation and modeling of foliage, at least segmentation and 
modeling of trunk and branches [1]. One needs to receive near 30 images of a single 
object from various points of view without shadows by digital non-calibrated camera. 
Then an image segment with well-defined leaf structure is manually chosen as a sam- 
ple. Leaf modeling includes a creation of 2D-model, a contour deformation of 2D- 
model, a creation of 3D-model, a common form deformation, and a form texturing. 
Usually a special package is used for modeling of trunk and branches with such op- 
erations as arcs' drawing, displacement, editing, connections based on input image 
segmentation. After that broad-leaved mass is covered on 3D-model. The main disad- 
vantage of such approach is a manually drawing of trunk and branches, but it is possi- 
ble to model of really existing in nature growth. In the second case methods are 
subdivided on context-free, deterministic, stochastic, context-depended and paramet- 
ric methods. The most of them are fractal based methods. The simplest context-free 
and deterministic systems use the determined values of angles, lengths and basic vec- 
tors in 2D- and 3D-spaces. More complex stochastic systems assign probability

values for decision rules. In context-depended systems the rule syntax is complicated 
by analysis of adjacent elements. In parametric systems we may store parameters of 
modeling branch (angle, length, thickness), check the conditions for rule application, 
and set a number of iterations. Advantages of such approach are compact mathemati- 
cal models and modeling of trees growth considering biochemical processes and the 
environment. A disadvantage is a complex modeling for men who are not experts in 
such sphere. 

2 Related Work 

Realistic modeling is directly depended from possible interactions between various 
elements into a tree structure, and between trees structures in the environment (last 
modeling is a very complex task). That's why at present simpler models are used. One 
of the first famous models suggested by H. Honda was the model with following 
strong assumptions [2]: 

- Tree segments are lines, squares of their crosscuts are not considered; 

- During iteration a parent segment divides into two child segments; 

- Lengths of two child segments are in r\ and r 2 times more shooter then a par- 
ent segment; 

- A parent segment and its two child segments are situated in one plane of 
branching, and child segments come out from a parent segment with branching 
angles oci and a 2 \ 

- Under action of gravity force a plane of branching is closely to a horizontal 
plane except of branches connecting with a trunk, in this case a constant angle 
a is used. 

In 1968 Hungarian biologist A. Lindenmayer suggested a mathematical model for 
development simulation of simple multicellular organisms which was later extended 
for modeling of complex branching structures - trees and flowers. Such model is 
known as Lindenmayer System (L-system or Lindenmayer grammar) [3]. The Lin- 
denmayer grammar is similar to Chomsky hierarchy language but with simultaneous 
application of production rules. Each iteration process is represented by strings denot- 
ing by symbols Xâ, X n+l ,... in a formal language. The strings do not contain geometri- 
cal data: additionally drawing rules are necessary to translate such strings to morpho- 
logical descriptors. Many well-known classical fractal curves are presented by L- 
system. An L-system is defined by a triple 

G= <V, W, PR> , (1) 

where V is a set of symbols; Wis a starting string or axiom; PR is a production rule. 

Expression (1) determines so-called deterministic L-system. Trees generated by 
such expression have identical shapes and artificial regularities in spite of modifica- 
tions of geometrical parameters - trunk length and branching angles. In this case the 
topology of modeling tree remains unchanged. A stochastic L-system is constructed 
according to a stochastic grammar 



Procedural Modeling of Broad-Leaved Trees under Weather Conditions 53 



SG d =<V, W, PR, d> , (2) 

where V is an alphabet; W is an axiom, PR is a set of productions; a function 
d : PRâ >(0,1) is a probability distribution, it converts a set of productions PR into the 
set of production probabilities. The sum of probabilities of all productions for any let- 
ter ae V is equal to 1 . 

Another method for simulation of biological objects is based on Iterated Functional 
Systems (IFS) suggested by M. F. Barnsley [4]. A first component is a finite set of 
mappings in 2D- or 3D-space M={Mi, M 2 , ...,M m }; a second component is a set of 
corresponding probabilities P={P U P 2 ,...,P m ] where the sum of probabilities is equal 
to 1. Fractal objects are generated by randomly choosing mappings from set M. The 
iteration process starts from a point z and a mapping M, with probability P, resulting 
in Zi=Mj(zo), and so on. The initial points z are assigned from points of attraction in 
the case the mappings are limited and the process is converged. 

Some authors consider a realistic modeling of plants as automatically rendering 
pen-and-ink illustrations of trees [5] which are usually created by combining brush or 
pencil strokes. Trunk and branches up to the second order are presented by an assem- 
bly of generalized cylinders which 2D-projections are well described by analytical 
silhouette algorithms with corresponding shadows and texture. Significant attention is 
concerned for realistic drawing of several thousand of leaves. The authors do not built 
a tree model but made a single 2D-illustration with the foliage conditionally divided 
into three areas. The top of a tree is usually under the direct Sun rays and must be 
visualized with maximum details. In the middle (half shadow) leaves are also drawn 
in detail. Bottom of a tree is a shaded part; it may be invisible in a single illustration. 
That's why this area is not elaborate drawing. Such approach connects with 3D visual 
effects of shadows on foliage for a single illustration but not for 3D-scenes. 

P. Tan et al. developed a simple sketching method for realistic 3D-model of a tree 
from a single image [6]. They suggested a manual drawing of strokes on an image to 
create a tree model starting from crown, branches and finishing a main trunk. The 
branch thickness is computed by varying a circle radius to find a largest circle whose 
pixels are all branch pixels. This thickness computation is unreliable for small twigs. 
That's why authors simply set a branch radius to 75% of its parent branch. Interesting 
variant of foliage extraction was suggested. They use a Gaussian mixture model 
(GMM) in crown region to identify color crown from background. Ten Gaussian dis- 
tributions are computed and only four the most green or red Gaussian components are 
covered to leaf cluster. GMM's G(I X ,C1 F ) and G(I X ,C1 B ) are composed foreground and 
background segments in crown where I x is a function of brightness in RGB-space 
along axis OX, Q F and Q. B are GMM parameters. For each pixel x label p x is com- 
puted, (3 A e[0,l] via graph cut where (3 X =0 represents leaf pixels and (3 X =1 represents 
background pixels. 

T. Ijiri, S. Owada, and T. Igarashi suggested a tree modeling system based on L- 
system that allows the user to control the overall appearance and the depth of recur- 
sion during growth process [7]. A user determines a growth direction as a drawn 
stroke, and a system gradually advances the growth simulation. Also a sketching in- 
terface creates a rough model which is quickly rebuilt under a user's intentions. So, 
here we see an application of adaptive generating rules but with the help of user.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 3 we introduce 
some procedures which are improving a reality of a tree life-cycle. Section 4 contains 
a modeling of broad-leaved trees under some weather conditions, and Section 5 pre- 
sents a forest modeling. In Section 6 we tell about our experimental program, and in 
Section 7 we give conclusion. 

3 Procedural Modeling of Broad-Leaved Trees 

Let's extend stochastic grammar using some procedures which include natural fea- 
tures of growth and aging of trees. Let's transform an axiom W from expression (2) to 
an initial chose procedure PR W which calculates a set of parameters 

PR w ={Pbo, Ab , Tb , Lbol , (3) 

where Pbo is a central point of branch with coordinates (x,y,z)', Abo is a set of angle 
values in 3D-space in central point Pbo; Tb is a set of thickness of branch 0; Lb is a 
set of proposed length of branch 0. Extended set (3) maintains parameters of branch 
in experimental interval estimations for modeling a hardwood containing a certain 
kind of trees. 

It is well-known a monopodial and sympodial structures of trees [3]. In this paper 
we'll discuss a sympoidal structure of broad-leaved trees which supposes a uniform 
growth of all branches. (A monopodial structure typifies for firs, pines, cedars and 
other conifers.) 

In fractal model a fractal "branching" is interpreted as a tree growth but it's not 
right because thickness and length of sub-branches are also increased. Let's introduce 
a growing procedure PR G which is periodically restarted and recalculates parameters 
of all branches and trunk simulating annual tree volume: 

PR G ={ GF h GU Pbâ Abâ Tb u Lb, } , ie (0,N) , (4) 

where GF, is a growing factor of i branch (in a simple case it may be a constant); GL, 
is a variable calling a foliage increasing; Ab, is a set of angle values in 3D-space in 
central point Pb,; Tb h Lb, are a thickness and a length of i branch increased by a grow- 
ing factor GFj correspondingly; N is a number of visible branches. Procedure (4) 
makes a growing tree more realistic; it's especially important for trees' modeling 
without foliage. 

A process of growing is not a single process during trees life-cycle. Under some 
biological artifacts or weather conditions a tree changes its branch structure that leads 
to degenerate the parts of branches until a whole tree will not become a dry tree. Let's 
determine a degenerating procedure PR D which recalling frequency is connected with 
the age of a tree. We may call such procedure non-periodically during a tree growing 
but during a tree drying procedure PR D will stop a development of tree' branches and 
foliage. So, 

PR D = { DF h DL b Pbâ Tb b Lb i } , ie (0,N) , (5) 

where DF t is a degenerating factor of i branch DF t =(0, 1], if ZXF,=0 then i branch and 
its foliage are implicity destroyed ; DL, is a variable calling a foliage decreasing; 



Procedural Modeling of Broad-Leaved Trees under Weather Conditions 55 

Tbi, Lbi are a decreasing of thickness and a length of i branch by a degenerating factor 
DFi correspondingly in point Pb,; A? is a number of visible branches. 

We apply procedures (3) - (5) for simulation of a broad-leaved forest, also proce- 
dures (4) and (5) are used for simulation of season foliage effects. More advisable ap- 
proach for foliage imitation is an object approach for creation a sample of a leaf (for a 
given tree kind) with available morphed transformations during leafs appearance in 
spring. Leaf falling simulation in autumn is connected with a speed and character fal- 
ling of leaves having various square values. Then foliage store on the Earth' surface 
and change a texture of a 3D-surface scene. 

A single tree modeling is accomplished by algorithm 1 : 

Initial data: kind of tree, initial parameters of trunk, crown, samples of leaf texture. 

Step 1. Run an initial chose procedure (3). 

Step 2. Generate of tree structure (based on L-system) by using initial parameters 
of a tree kind and results from Step 1 . 

Step 3. Create foliage and cover foliage texture. 

Step 4. Visualize an object in 3D-scene. 

Step 5. If it is necessary, run a growing procedure (4) and rebuild an object (Step 2 
- Step 4). 

Step 6. If it is necessary, run a degenerating procedure (5) and rebuild an object 
(Step 2 - Step 4). 

Output data: 3D visualization of a single tree. 

Algorithm 1 is a simple case of a tree modeling. Let's discuss a modeling of trees 
under weather conditions and a forest modeling. 

4 Modeling of Tree under Weather Conditions 

Many natural effects are concerned to weather conditions such as wind, rain, fog, snow, 
also a day luminance [8]. The often used natural effect is a wind simulation with various 
forces. In this paper we do not consider unusual natural disasters [9]. We'll discuss a mod- 
eling of wind and luminance influence on a tree structure generation during some years. 
Also we'll consider a simulation of branches' flexure under a wind. 

There are some woodland on the Earth' surface which are characterized by a stable 
wind rose. We may interpret such influence as a set of local geometrical barriers. The 
barriers distort a trunk, branches and their locations along a prior direction of stable 
wind rose. In this case a distorted tree model is actively generated by user corrections. 
When we have received a basic distorted tree model we replicate it as a fractal struc- 
ture with an initial chose procedure (3). Thereby we simulate woodland with inclined 
trunks of trees and clearly defined directions of branches. 

Usually a wind is not strong, that's why we'll discuss in detail a branches' flexure 
(if a wind is very weak then it is enough to make small changes in leaves texture from 
frame to frame - a simulation of leaves blinks). It is ought to calculate a controlled 
correction simulating a flexure in branches coordinates. One approach consists in cal- 
culation of rotating matrix round an axis passing via branch origin and normal to a 
wind force vector. However a branch consists from sub-branches (according to fractal 
modeling), and a number of such matrixes makes impossible the calculations in real

time. We suggest a simpler but less exact approach connecting with displacement of 
branch in a required direction. The main task is to find such direction. 

We may suggest that a vector of wind speed can not have a vertical direction. 
That's why it is required to find projections of such vector (wind of "unit force") for 
every branch along directions OX and OY in a horizontal plane. A direction of dis- 
placement is a normal relatively direction of branch because a branch can not change 
its length. So, if we know a direction of a wind we'll find a direction of branch dis- 
placement as a product of vectors. A length of displacement vector is proportional to a 
length of branch. Thereby we found own oscillations of branch. In common case a 
branch has oscillations of load-bearing branches which are calculated similarly and 
then summarized (a trunk is stationary). We may take into account a thickness of 
branches setting a constant which is depend from branch level in recursion. For realis- 
tic effect let's add a wind randomness. This parameter is well described with a noise 
suggested by K. Perlin [10]. Imitation of oscillations lag of branches (during a change 
of a wind direction) may be realized as a gradual change of a wind direction by linear 
interpolations between adjacent frames. Also we can add a resonance random moving 
of wands depending from a wind force as an additional constant in calculations. 

Generalized algorithm of tree modeling under weather conditions has following 
steps (algorithm 2): 

Initial data: L-model of a tree, parameters of main natural effects. 
Step 1 . Choose a natural effect. 

Step 2. Determine barriers distorting a tree development if it is necessary. 
Step 3. Recalculate L-model of a tree by using parameters of a chosen effect. 
Step 4. Visualize an object in 3D-scene. 
Output data: 3D visualization of a single tree. 

In Sections 3 and 4 we considered only a model of a single tree but a forest model- 
ing is based on another model - a model of interactions. 

5 Forest Modeling 

We consider that a forest modeling is based on following assumptions. Model-based 
space in divided into 3D-cellular structure so that a crown of one tree may situate only 
in one cell or as exception in adjacent cells in horizontal or vertical planes. The sizes 
of such cells are chosen by analysis the experimental data of realistic forest. As a re- 
sult each tree is associated with any cell, has its space coordinates that permits to sim- 
plify essentially a forest model and decrease an execution time of algorithm. A day 
luminance for each tree is well modeled by space division on such 3D cells. Spatial 
structure of forest model is presented on fig. 1. 

The basic structure unit is a tree, and forest modeling is accumulated the results of 
dynamic modeling of a separate trees. According to this assumption we consider an 
individual development of some tree with a spatial distribution of other trees. In such 
model we set local barriers (as a part on planes under different angles) near growth 
tree if we have a closely located an old tree with a big crown. So we use L-system 
with geometrical limitations when a tree can not well develop in restricted zones. For 
such weak trees a degenerating procedure (5) is recalled often when for normal trees.

The dynamic modeling of a single tree requires the assessment of the influence of 
other closely situated trees; otherwise we watch a competition for external resources: 
light, water, minerals, location. So the state of tree in some instant depends from 
kinds and age-specific groups of closely located trees. These parameters are enough 
for receive a model of continuous varying in time forest' discontinuities. A model of 
single tree includes three stages: (1) a tree growth, (2) a competition for external re- 
sources, and (3) reproduction, aging and collapse. A model of forest includes spatial 
interactions between trees under possible biological, weather, and human activities. A 
modeling of forest is not a well investigated process but the experimental results show 
that processes of chaotic self-organization are occurred even in uniform external con- 
ditions. Appearance of such discontinuities is explained by causes of inner spatial 
competition for life resources. 

A forest modeling is accomplished by algorithm 3: 

Initial data: kind of trees, L-models of trees and their coordinates, 3D spatial space. 

Step 1, Choose sizes of cells and label used cells. 

Step 2. Determine barriers distorting a tree development if it is necessary. 

Step 3. Recalculate dynamically L-model of trees. 

Step 4. Simulate a life-cycle of trees. 

Step 5. Visualize dynamically 3D-scene. 

Output data: 3D visualization of forest scene. 



6 Experimental Program 



Experimental program "Trees Editor" includes three main modules: a module of a 
single tree generation (6 kinds of broad-leaved trees), a module of weather conditions 
(imitation of wind, luminance, fog, rain), and a module of forest generation. A tree 
generation is based on L-system with proposed procedures concerning a life-cycle of 
a tree. A tree model is saved as an object in 3D-scene, and we may apply standard

operations such as rotation, scaling, translation. If it is necessary we call a point light 
source in scene, and program automatically forms a tree shadow. In module of 
weather conditions the user may locate "semitransparent" barriers back from which 
only wands penetrate. We gave consideration a sub-module of wind imitation and re- 
ceived good visual results in real time. A module of forest generation represents a dy- 
namic of growing closely located trees but it is needed in following development for 
more realistic results. We imitate a Sun moving across a scene with shadow effects 
and balancing day illumination. At present many functions of this module are accom- 
plished manually. On fig. 2 the main screen of our experimental program is presented.

Fig. 2. Main screen of experimental program "Trees Editor" 



For program realization we used a graphical jet GLScene applying library OpenGL 
as application programming interface in development environment RAD Studio 2010. 
We used some standard objects from the jet GLScene such as TGLCamera (a camera 
object), TGLSceneViewer (a 3D viewer object), TGLMaterialLibrary (a library of 
materials), TGLFreeForm (a static 3D model), TGLLightSource (a light source), and 
some others. Also we designed original procedures and components for forest model- 
ing. Program "Trees Editor" has user-friendly interface but some complex functions 
need a preliminary instructions reading. 



Procedural Modeling of Broad-Leaved Trees under Weather Conditions 59 

We made experiments for modeling of a single tree in 3D scene (6 kinds of trees - 
a white birch, a broad-leaved maple, a green ash, a white poplar, a silky willow, a red 
oak) with various initial parameters and growth algorithms. We tested trees models 
imitating a wind with various force values and Sun lighting. Modeling of fog and rain 
is additional function of this program. Also we received relatively simple dynamic 
examples of forest modeling. Generated virtual scenes have a good visual effects and 
likely nature image by experts' estimations. 

7 Conclusion 

Analysis of existing methods of trees modeling shows that more constructive 
approach connects with application of L- system. We extended a stochastic L- 
grammar by proposed procedures including natural features of trees' life-cycle. Also 
proposed growing and degenerating procedures imitate a dynamic development of 
broad-leaved forest and season foliage effects. We considered a modeling of wind and 
luminance influence on a tree structure generation during some years and discussed a 
simulation of branches' flexure under a wind by simpler and less exact approach. 

We developed three algorithms for a single tree modeling, for tree modeling under 
weather conditions, and for forest modeling. Three basic modules of our experimental 
program "Trees Editor" are built on these algorithms. We generate 3D scenes by a 
graphical jet GLScene (applying the library OpenGL) and by own designed compo- 
nents. Generated virtual scenes have likely nature visualization and may be use in 
many virtual reality systems.

Abstract. The method for adaptive lossless image coding is aimed at efficient 
compression of grayscale or color digital still images. The method is based on 
the analysis of the processed images histograms, followed by modified Huff- 
man and Run-length coding. The coding is performed in two consecutive 
stages. In the first one, the input data (i.e., the digital information about the im- 
age brightness and color components) is transformed without affecting their 
volume in such a way, that to obtain sequences of same values (in particular, 
zeros) of maximum length. The transform is reversible and is based on the 
analysis of the input data histograms and on the differences between each num- 
ber in the processed data and the most frequent one. In the second stage of the 
processing the transformed data is analyzed and sequences of same numbers are 
detected. Every such sequence is substituted by a shorter one, corresponding to 
the number of same values which it contains. The method is extremely suitable 
for images of graphics or texts (for example: fingerprints, contour images, car- 
toons, medical signals, etc.). The method has low computational complexity 
and is suitable for real-time applications. 

Keywords: Lossless image compression, adaptive run-length coding, histo-

1 Introduction 

With rapidly advancing computer technologies, there is huge amount of visual data 
which should be archived and stored, retaining its quality as high as possible. Lossless 
image compression is required by medical imaging, satellite/aerial imaging, preserva- 
tion of special art work and documents, or any applications demanding ultra-high 
image fidelity. Furthermore, the lossless image coding is the last step of many lossy 
image compression systems, needed for example, for the lossless compression of the 
transform DCT coefficients or for the wavelet sub-band coding. The basic approach 
for archiving of documents and other imagery, which requires retained quality, is to 
use the famous standards JPEG and JPEG 2000, which answer these requirements to a 
very high degree. In some cases however, the image quality should be retained un- 
changed and the images should be losslessly coded. The methods developed to solve

this task are based on some kind of lossless data coding, the most important and 
widely used of which could be classified as follows: Coding based on dictionaries [1]: 
Lempel-Ziv; Statistical coding: Run-length [7], Shannon-Fano [3], Huffman [4], 
Arithmetic [5] (Binary arithmetic coding, QM-coder); Coding based on data trans- 
forms [2, 6]: Burrows-Wheeler Transform; Predictive coding; Structured universal 
coding schemes [8] (Elias codes, Exponential-Golomb codes): these schemes generate 
variable-length code words with a regular structure; Hybrid coding [7, 8] - a mixture 
of some of the methods, mentioned above: LOCO-I, adopted in the JPEG-LS stan- 
dard, and others. The coding algorithms, whose parameters are adaptive to some char- 
acteristics of the input data, are called "adaptive" [9-15]. 

In this work is presented one new method for adaptive lossless compression of still 
images based on the histogram statistics, called Adaptive Run-Length (ARL) Coding. 
The work is arranged as follows: Section 2 introduces the basic principles of the new 
method; Section 3 focuses on the evaluation of the method efficiency; Section 4 gives 
some experimental results for lossless still image compression and comparison with 
other contemporary methods and Section 5 is the Conclusions. 

2 Basic Principles of the ARL Coding Method 

The Adaptive Run-Length (ARL) coding method is aimed at the compression of im- 
age data, represented as N-dimensional sequence of n-bits binary words (numbers) x k 
for k=l,2,..,N, whose values are in the range: (-2"' 1 ) < x k < (2"' 1 -1). The method com- 
prises two basic steps. The first step should be assumed as a pre-processing, because 
the data is transformed in such a way, that to enhance the coding, performed in the 
second step. The image compression is based on new run-length coding of sequences 
of equal or regularly changing values. In result, each N-dimensional sequence repre- 
senting the image data is substituted by a shorter one, containing a header and com- 
pressed data. 

The method is described below. 

Preliminary processing of the input data 

The input data sequence x k for k = 1,2, ..., N is transformed into the sequence v k of 
same length N so, that to obtain sequences of maximum length of numbers with same 
value (in particular, this value is equal to zero). For this are performed the following 
operations: 

â¦â¦â¦ Analysis of the histogram of the processed image (the input data), x k : 

- The histogram H(x) is calculated for x = -2"" ', -2"-'+l, ..,-1, 0, 7,.., 2"'-l. Here 
H(x) is the count of the numbers whose value is equal to x. 

- The count L(x) is defined, representing the values in the histogram which are not 
used (free), and for which H(x)=0, when x =-2" y ,-2"" i +7,..,-i,0,i,.., 2" y -7: 

x=-2"- 1 l J 



New Method for Adaptive Lossless Compression of Still Images 63 

- Positions /?, = x, are defined, which correspond to the start of the intervals of free 
values. The lengths (Ali+1) of these intervals in the histogram H(x) are defined, in 
correspondence with the relation: 

iÂ£ [/?,, pi +Ali\ for i = 1,2, . . ,T(x), when L(x) > and H(x) = 0. (2) 

- The interval of free values and of maximum length is detected, as follows: 

p(x) = pi and l(x) = Al t = max for i = 1, 2, . . , T(x). (3) 

In case that there is more than one interval of free values and of maximal length, 
then l(x) corresponds to the one, whose start position has smallest value. 

â¦â¦â¦ The data x k are transformed into y k using a special coding, called "size- 

saving prediction coding" (SSP), specially developed for the lossless coding method. 
The processing is performed in correspondence with the relation: 

y = \( x k ~ x k-\ )> if (- 2 "' 1 )^(x k -x k _ l )<( I"' 1 - 1 ), 4 

I â ( x k + 1 ) - in all other cases, 

for k =1, 2, . . , N and x = 0. In result, the sequences of same numbers in x k are 
transformed into sequences of zeros in y k . 

â¦â¦â¦ The histogram H(y) of the data y k is calculated for y = -2"' 1 , -2 n ~'+l, ..., - 

7, 0, 1,.., 2"~'-l analyzed in the way, performed for x k , and the positions /?, = v, are de- 
fined, which point at the start of the intervals of free values. Their lengths (Al t +1) in 
the histogram H(y) are calculated in correspondence with the relation: 

y G \p h pi +Al t ] for i = l,2,..,T(y), when L(y) > and H(y) = 0. 

The longest interval of free values is detected, for which: 

p(y) = pi and l(y) = Al t = max for i = 1,2, . . ,T(y). (5) 

â¦â¦â¦ The conditions L(x) = and L(y) = are checked, which are satisfied if 

only there are no intervals of free values in the two histograms. A special flag is set, 
which indicates if the image data is suitable for compression. This flag is a special bit 
in the control word in the header of the losslessly coded data, named Fj. In case that 
conditions L(x) = and L(y) = are satisfied, the stage of the preliminary transform 
of the input data is stopped, and the coding ends. In all other cases the flag Fj= 1. Af- 
ter that is checked which data sequence x k or y k is more suitable for the lossless coding 
(i.e. which one will ensure higher compression) The choice is done in accordance 
with the relation: 

=rk ; F 2 ^),H(y)=H(x),L(y)=L(x),p(y)=p(x),l(yH(x)ifL(yWorL(x)>2 n -4; 
yt> ^2 = l ~ forSSPcoding. 

Here F 2 is a flag (another bit in the control word), which indicates the selected se- 
quence (F 2 = 1 if the sequence y k better suits the coding method). 
â¦â¦â¦ The value y = r(y), is defined, for which H(y) = max, when: 

y = -2"-', -2"-'+l, ..,-1,0,1,.., 2"-'-l. 



64 R. Kountchev, V. Todorov, and R. Kountcheva 

â¦â¦â¦ The data are modified transforming every word of the sequence y k into v k sub- 
tracting r(y) without setting carry in correspondence with the relation: 

[y k -r(y)] if [y k -r(y)]<=[-T-\2 n - l -\]; 

[y k -r(y)-2 n ] if [ y k - r( y )] > 2"" 1 - 1 ; for k= 1,2,..,N. (7) 

[y k -r(y) + 2 n ] if [ y k - r( y )] < -2 n ~\ 

â¦ The histogram H(v) for v = -2 n -',-2"-'+l,..,-l, 0, l,..,2 n ~'-l of the data se- 

quence v k is calculated and analyzed in the already described way for x k . The count 
L(v) of the free histogram values is also calculated and the positions pi = v, are de- 
fined, which point at the start of the intervals of free values. The lengths (Al t +1) of 
these intervals in the histogram H(v) are defined in correspondence with the relation: 

ve [p h pi +Ali] for i=l,2,.., T(v), when H(v) = (8) 

The maximum interval of free values is defined as follows: 

p(v) = pi and l(v) = Al t = max for i = l,2,..,T(v). (9) 

â¦â¦â¦ The flag F 3 is set, which indicates that the length of the interval of free 

values is bigger than 1. It is set in the coded data control word, in accordance with the 
length [l(v)+l] of the detected interval of free values, as follows: 

Jl,if l(v)>0; 
3 [0, ifl(v) = 0. uu; 

With this, the first step of the processing is finished. In result is obtained the trans- 
formed data sequence v k for k=l,2,..,N and is defined the additional information about 
r(y), p(v) and l(v), which are processed in the second step of the coding. 

Data coding 

In this part of the processing is composed the header of the coded data, needed for 
the proper coding/decoding of the transformed data sequence, v k . This part of the 
processing comprises the following basic operations: 

Composition of the coded data header 

The header is necessary for the proper decoding of the compressed data and consists 
of control word woo, which comprises the three control flags F], F 2 and F 3 and addi- 
tional information, presented below. The header contains additional information, in 
accordance with the conditions: 

- for Fj= the header does not contain additional information; 

- for Fj=l the header contains additional information, which comprises the num- 
bers w j=r(y) and w 2=p(v). Here r(y) is the most frequently met value in the data se- 
quence y k , and p(v) is the start position of the longest interval of free values in the data 
sequence v k , which was detected first; 

- for Fj=l and F 3 =l the additional information in the header includes one more 
number w 3=l(v), which defines the length of the interval with start position p(v), de- 
creased by 1 . 



New Method for Adaptive Lossless Compression of Still Images 65 

Coding of the transformed data 

> For Fj = 1 the transformed data are processed in accordance with the new 
method for adaptive lossless coding. For this, each sequence of numbers of same 
value in v k is substituted by w s , and in result is got a shorter data sequence: 

- Each sequence of zeros v d =v d+1 =....=v d+P _ 1 =0 of length P in the range 1<P <l(v) 
+1, which had been detected in v k is substituted by one w-bit word w = p(v) + P-l, 
i.e.: 

(v d , v d+] ,.., v d+P .,) => (w=p(v) + P-l). (11) 

For P = 1 the sequence contains one zero only (v d = 0) and the coding is not per- 
formed; 

- Each zero sequence v d =v d+ ]=....=v d+ p.]=0 of length P which is in the range 2 mn > 
P > l(v)+ 1 for m >1, detected in v k , is substituted by 2m words, of n bits each. In the 
first word is stored p(v), in the next (m-1 ) words is stored zero, and in the remaining m 
words - the number (P-l), i.e.: 

(v d , Vd+i... , v d+P .,) => (wi = p(v), w 2 =0, . . ,w m =0, w m+ i = Pi,..,w 2m = P m ), (12) 

where P,, .., P m corresponds to the number (P-l), represented by m words of n bits 
each (here P, is the MSW,.. . and P m - the LSW); 

- Each sequence of same numbers, not equal to zero v d = v d+1 = .... = v d+P _i = v of 
length P in the range 2 mn >P > 4 for m > 1, detected in v k , is substituted by (2m+2) 
words, n bits each. In the first two words are stored the numbers p(v) and "1", in the 
next (m-1) words - zeros, in the next m words - the number (P-l) and in the last word 
- the number, which is different from zero, v # i.e.: 

(v d , v d+h .âv d+ p-i) => (w,=p(v),w 2 = l,w 3 = 0,..,w m+ i = 0,w m+2 = P,,..,w 2m+ , = P m , 

W 2m+ 2=V), (13) 

where Pi,.., P m present the number (P-l), coded as m words of n bits each (here Pj is 
the MSW,.. . and P m - the LSW). 

Sequences of non-zero values of length P <4 are not losslessly coded, because this 
does not enhance the method efficiency. 

In result of the so presented coding the v k data is transformed into the compressed 
sequence w s for s=l,2,..,S and (-2"~ ') <w s <(2"~'- 1). Here S is the count of the words 
in the sequence w s , which is smaller than the total count N of the words in the original 
sequence x k . 

> For Fl = the input sequence x k is not compressed and after the header follows 
the original data: w s = x k fors = k= 1,2, ..., N (S = N). 

Data decoding 

The decoding of the w s sequence comprises the following operations: 

â¢ The flags in the control word of the coded data header w o are analyzed consecu- 
tively. Two main cases are possible: 

If Fj = 0, this means that the input data sequence x k had not been losslessly coded 
and the decoded data u s is connected with w s by the relation u s = w s for ^=7, 2, 3, ..., S 

(S = N); 



66 R. Kountchev, V. Todorov, and R. Kountcheva 

If Fj=l, this means that the input sequence x k had been coded and the following 
steps are then performed: 

Step 1: The flag F 3 is analyzed (for Fj=l) and the decoding is performed. In the 
case, when F 3 =l is analyzed the available additional information from the header of 
the compressed sequence w s : the numbers r(y) = w oh p(v) = w 02 , l(v) = w 03 - In the 
case, for F 3 = 0, this information comprises only numbers r(y) = w i and p(v) = w 02 
(for the decoding l(v)=0). After that, every value of w s for s=l, 2,.., S and F 3 =0 is 
compared with the number p(v). Depending on the difference S s = w s - p(v) when the 
value of w s is decoded, it is retained, or substituted by a sequence of numbers of same 
value, v p = v for p = 1, 2,.., P in correspondence with one of the followings 
procedures: 

- For S s > l(v) or S s < 0, the value of w s is not changed. In this case is performed the 
substitution w s => (v = w s ); 

- For < S s < l(v), the value of w s is substituted by the sequence v p , of length 
P=w s -p(v)+l, which consists of zeros only, and w s => ( Vj= , v 2 = ,.., v p = ); 

- For S s = and w s+1 # 0, the data w s and w s+] are substituted by the sequence v p of 
length P=w s+] +l, which consists of zeros only, and in result is obtained (w s , w s+] ) => 
(v 1= 0, v 2 = 0,..,v p = 0); 

- For S s = 0, w s+ i = 0,..,w s+m .i = 0, w s+m &0,..,w s +2 m -i **0, the data in w s up to w s+ 2 m - 
i are substituted by the sequence v p , consisting of zeros only, with length P = 
(w s+m ,..,w s+2m .i) + 1 (w s+m is the MSW, and yv SJr2m -i is the LSW) and then (w s ,.., w s+2m .,) 
^f Vl =0,v 2 = 0,..,v p = 0J; 

- For S s = 0, w s+ i= 1 and w s+2 #0, the data in w s up to w s+3 are substituted by the 
sequence v p , consisting of non-zero numbers v=w s+3 of length P=w s+2 +l, and then 
(wâ . . , W S+3 )=>(N]=N, v 2 =v,.., v P = vJ. 

- For S s = 0, w s+1 = 1, w s+2 = 0,..,w s+m = 0, w s+m+1 ^0,..,w s+2m #0, the data in w s up 
to w s+2m+ i are substituted by the sequence v p , consisting of non-zero numbers 
v=w s+2m+1 of length P=(w s+m+1 ,..,w s+2m )+l (w s+m+] is the MSW, and w s+2m is the LSW), 
and then (w s , . . . , w s+2m .i) => ( v x = v , v 2 = v ,.., v P = v ). 

At the end is obtained the decoded sequence v k . 

Step 2. Inverse data modification is performed, which transforms every word v k 
into y k adding r(y) to its value without carry, in accordance with the relations: 



yk 



[v k +r(y)] if [v k +r(y)]e[-2 n - l ,2 n - l -l]; 

[v k +r(y)-2 n ] if [v k +r(y)]>2"- 1 -l; for k = 1,2,..,N; (14) 

k+r (y)+2 n ] if [v k A 



[v k +r(y)+2 n ] if [v k + r( y )] < -2"" 1 



Step 3 . The flag F 2 is analyzed when the operations, defined in accordance with 
flags F] and F 3 , are finished. If F 2 = 0, this indicates that the sequence x k had not been 
SSP coded and then u k = x k = y k for k = 1, 2,..., N. In case, that F 2 =l, is necessary to

3 Evaluation of the Lossless Coding Method Efficiency 

The compression ratio is calculated as a relation between the original and the com- 
pressed data, i.e. CR = N/(S+ W), where W is the number of the words in the header. 
The minimum value CR mm = N/(N +1) < 1 is obtained for the case, when the data x k 
are not compressed. In this case S = N and W = 1, because the header consists of one 
word only (the control word). The maximum value of CR is obtained for x k = x (k = 1, 
2,..., N). In this case P = N, S = 2m, W = 4 and CR max < N/[(2/n)lg 2 N+4], From this 
follows that the compression ratio is in the range: 

â â <CR< p== â ; For TV Â» 1 is obtained 1 <CR <N/lg2 a/a^ . n ^ 

N + l l g2 4^ + A (16) 

The analysis shows that the compression ratio can achieve significant values when 
there are long sequences of same numbers in v k . 

The presented method for lossless image compression is suitable for coding of im- 
ages, whose brightness or color histograms have free values, or they have large areas 
of same or continuously changing brightness/color. Such histograms are typical for 
scanned documents, graphics, fingerprints, medical signals, etc. The processing of 
each of the color components is performed in the way, described above for grayscale 
images. 



4 Experimental Results 

The experiments were performed with the still image database of the Laboratory for 
Image and Sound Processing of the Technical University of Sofia, Bulgaria. For the 
experiments were used more than 800 grayscale and color still images of fingerprints, 
signatures, texts and biomedical signals (ECGs, EEGs, etc.) of various sizes, (.bmp 
files). The results were compared with those obtained for JPEG2000LS -based soft- 
ware. The test software implementation of the method is in C++, Windows environ- 
ment. On Fig. 1 are shown example test images from the image database. The test im- 
age "Phong" is color (24 bpp, RGB) and the remaining images are grayscale (8 bpp). 

In Table 1 are shown the results obtained for test images from Fig. 1 . Similar results 
were obtained for the remaining images from the corresponding image classes. Best 
results were obtained for images with many free brightness levels in their histograms. 
For illustration only, the histogram of the image ECG is shown on Fig. 2.

New Method for Adaptive Lossless Compression of Still Images 69 

Extremely good results were obtained for images, which contain relatively large 
areas of same or continuously changing brightness or color. Example test image and 
its histogram are shown on Fig. 4.a,b. The compression ratio, obtained for this image 
with the ARL method was 89.5, while for JPEG2000LS it was 22. The compression 
ratio obtained for the color test image "Green" of size 512x512 pixels, 24 bpp (uni- 
form green color), with the ARL method was 52428 (the compressed file was of size 
1 1 bytes only), while the compression ratio for the JPEG2000LS was 84 (the com- 
pressed file was of size 3120 B).

5 Conclusions 

Compared to other contemporary methods for lossless still image compression, the 
ARL coding/decoding has relatively low computational complexity. For example, 
JPEG 2000LS is based on the wavelet transform (which has very high computational 
complexity) and arithmetic coding. Specific for the method, presented above, is that it 
comprises operations "sorting" and "adding", while the operation "multiplication" or 
some kind of complicated transforms are not used. The method ensures very high 
compression ratios for cases, when the original data contains long sequences of same 
values or regularly changing values. These basic characteristics distinguish the new 
method from the famous methods for RL data coding. The experimental results con- 
firmed the theoretical conclusions. Additional research in the area of documents ar- 
chiving and processing of biomedical signals proved the wide application area of the 
method [16, 17]. The ARL method could be further improved, combining it with 
methods for image pre-processing (adaptive histogram modification), and methods for 
lossless compression (Huffman or arithmetic coding, etc.). In accordance with the 
method were developed a special format. 

On the basis of the method evaluation follows that the main applications of the 
ARL coding method and its future development are in the areas: 

â¢ Development of new Internet-based systems for e-trade, distance learning, com- 
puter games, and many others; 

â¢ Creation of algorithm for image compression, which to be integrated in the ap- 
plication software for scanners and faxes, because the method is equally efficient for 
different alphabets, fonts, etc.

Abstract. Most of the numerous studies of scene categorization assume a fixed 
number of classes, and none categorize images with efficient class extendibility 
while preserving discriminative ability. This capability is crucial for an effective 
image categorization system. The proposed scene categorization method 
provides category-specific visual-word construction and image representation. 
The proposed method is effective for several reasons. First, since the visual-word 
construction and image representation are category-specific, image features 
related to the original classes need not be recreated when new classes are added, 
which minimizes reconstruction overhead. Second, since the visual-word 
construction and image representation are category-specific, the corresponding 
learning model for classification has substantial discriminating power. 
Experimental results confirm that the accuracy of the proposed method is 
superior to existing methods when using single-type and single-scale features. 

Keywords: Scene categorization, classification, category-specific, class

1 Introduction 

The problem of scene categorization is to categorize a scene image where each image in 
a given set is considered one category. Among the many approaches to scene 
categorization, Bag-of- Visual-Words approach [1-16] has achieved great success in 
recent years. In this approach, each image is represented by a non-ordered collection of 
local features, which are then quantized into a set of visual words to form a codebook. 
Each image is then represented by the distribution of visual words. 

Quelhas et al. [1] proposed Bags-of-Visterms to represent invariant local features 
and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) to model scenes. Fei-Fei and 
Perona [2] represented a scene image by a collection of local regions, denoted as

codewords obtained by unsupervised learning. They also modified the Latent Dirichlet 
Allocation to model scenes. Lazebnik et al. [3] proposed a spatial pyramid matching 
based on multi-spatial resolutions for recognizing natural scene categories. Zhou et al. 
[4] used Gaussianized vector representation rather than the distribution of visual words 
to represent scene images for categorization. A comparative study was performed in 
Ref. [5]. 

Some researchers [6-9] have considered contextual information to improve 
categorization accuracy. A detailed survey can be found in Ref. [6], Some researchers 
[10-12] have focused on compact codebook construction. Some researchers [13-16] 
have proposed novel features or learning models to improve categorization accuracy. 

However, most approaches assume a fixed number of classes, and none categorize 
images with efficient class extendibility while preserving discriminative ability. This 
capability is crucial for an effective image categorization system. The proposed scene 
categorization method provides category-specific visual-word construction and image 
representation. The proposed method is effective for several reasons. First, since the 
visual-word construction and image representation are category-specific, image 
features related to the original classes need not be recreated when new classes are 
added, which minimizes reconstruction overhead. Second, since the visual-word 
construction and image representation are category-specific, the corresponding 
learning model for classification has substantial discriminating power. Experimental 
results confirm that the accuracy of the proposed method is superior to existing 
methods when using single-type and single-scale features. 

Section 2 introduces three strategies for codebook construction and image 
representation, including the proposed method. Section 3 gives the experimental 
results. Section 4 concludes the study and proposes future works. 



2 Category-Specific Approach 

The scene categorization problem can be formulated as follows. Given an image /, a set 
of C scene categories {l,2,---,C| , and a training set of labeled images 
T = yÂ° \s = 1, , â¢ â¢ â¢ , 5, c = 1, â¢ â¢ â¢ , C\ , identify the category of image /. Here, S is the number 
of labeled images for each category, i.e., the number in the training set Tis CxS. To 
solve the problem, this section describes three possible strategies. The former two are 
existing methods, and the latter is the novel proposed method for achieving class 
extendibility. 

2.1 Whole-Construction/Whole-Representation Strategy 

The conventional Bag-of- Visual-Words approach adopts the whole-construction/whole- 
representation (W-C/W-R) strategy for solving the problem. In the training phase of this 
strategy, each training image I c s is divided into N local image patches of fixed size P n . The 
training set contains CxSxN patches. For each patch, local features x n of dimension d, such 
as SIFT of dimension 128 [17], are extracted. Accordingly, the CxSxN features are then fed 
into an unsupervised learning model such as A'-Means clustering [18] to construct a size M

codebook, which is denoted [w t \k = 1, â¢â â ,M\ based on the similarity measure. Suppose 

that training image 1Â° has N patch features, x c s (n),c = l,---,15,s = 1,---,S, n = I,---, N . 

Each patch with features x'(w) is then labeled as a codeword w / ,, .* from the codebook 
f I 1 II ./ \ ikwj 

(w t \k = 1, â¢ â¢ â¢ , M j according to the Euclidean distance xj (w J - w, . . 

For all patches of the image 1Â° , the codeword distribution (histogram h' ) can then 

be calculated by the following equation to represent F . 

h;=(/t;(i),---,/Â»;(Af)) 

, x \\r(n)\L{x c (n)) = k,n = l,---,N] C 1 ) 

h'(k)= l â â l â â i,ife = l,.--,M 

AT 

where Iâ I denotes cardinality function. The CxS histograms h' can then be fed into a 
learning model such as a support vector machine (SVM) to obtain a C-to-1 classifier. 
Note that the dimension of the SVM is M. In the testing phase, the unknown image / is 
also divided into N local image patches of fixed size. Similarly, each patch of / can be 
labeled as a codeword, and / can be represented by a histogram of codewords h, which 
can then be fed into the learned C-to-1 classifier to determine its category. 

However, the proposed approach to representing a scene image is vector-based [4] 
rather than histogram-based. Specifically, a scene image is represented by the feature 
vector of the codeword rather than by the histogram of the codeword count. Restated, 
each training image 7 s e with patch features x'(Â«)is represented by the mean feature 
vector F' = /f'(l),---,f'(M)\ with f'(fc) as defined by the following equation.

{x;; (Â«)|l(x;; (Â«)) = Â£, Â« = i, â¢ â¢ â¢ , Aq 

Note that the dimensions of the C-to-1 SVM classifiers are M and dxM when using 
the histogram-based approach and the vector-based approach, respectively. The 
experiments in Ref. [4] showed that the latter approach generally achieves a higher 
dimension and thus a higher categorization accuracy rate. This study therefore applied 
the vector-based approach. 

2.2 Category-Specific-Construction/Whole-Representation Strategy 

A category-specific-construction/whole-representation (C-C/W-R) strategy (Figure 1) 
was recently proposed in Ref. [9]. Experimental results in that study confirmed that this 
strategy is more accurate compared to the conventional W-C/W-R strategy [9, 10]. In 
the training phase of this approach, each training image /' is divided into Af local image 
patches of fixed size with local features x'(Â«) . However, the codebook is constructed 
individually for each category c. Restated, only the SxN features of images belonging to 
a specific category i are fed into AT-Means clustering to construct a size M codebook 
\w' t \k = 1,---,MJ. The Ccodebooks, one for each category, are then combined into one 
codebook of size CxM, denoted as (w' t \i = l,---,C,k = 1,---,MJ . All subsequent 
processes in the training phase and in the testing phase are identical to those in the

where mod(/) and rem(/) are the quotient and remainder, respectively, after dividing j 
by M. The above two strategies use the same codebook to represent whole scene images 
regardless of category. However, the two approaches have different codebook sizes. In 
the histogram-based approach, each scene image is represented by histograms with 
dimensions M and CxM for strategies W-C/W-R and C-C/W-R, respectively, whereas 
each scene in the vector-based approach is represented by vectors of dimensions dxM 
and dxCxM for strategies W-C/W-R and C-C/W-R, respectively. 



Scene Categorization with Class Extendibility and Effective Discriminative Ability 75 



2.3 Category-Specific-Construction/ Category-Specific-Representation Strategy 

Nevertheless, the above two strategies assume a fixed number of classes and are not 
concerned with categorizing images with efficient class extendibility while preserving 
discriminative ability. However, this issue is crucial for an effective scene categorization 
system. The category-specific-construction /category-specific-representation (C-C/C-R) 
strategy proposed in this study obtains a scene categorization with efficient class 
extendibility and effective discriminative ability. Figure 2 is a flowchart of the detailed 
steps of the proposed method. 

Codebook construction in the proposed method is the same as that in C-C/W-R 
strategy. Although C codebooks (w' t \k -l,---,M pâ !,â¢â¢â , C, are also obtained, they 
are not combined into a single codebook. Instead, each category-specific codebook is 
used to represent scene images individually. That is, each patch with features x'(Â«)is 

then labeled for each category i as a codeword w'.< , .Â» from the codebook

Each training image l c s with patch features x' (Â«) is then represented by the mean 

feature vector F; ='(f;(l,l), â¢â¢â¢,f;(l, M ),â¢â¢â¢, f;(C,l),-- -,f;(C,M )) with r(i,k) as

f;(a)= n . , /'f'fi^ l ,c=x-,c,s=\,-,s,i=x-,c,k=x-,M w 

|x>Mx>))=&,n=L" % Ar] 



Notably, each scene image is represented by the same dimension used in the 
C-C/W-R strategy, regardless of whether the approach is histogram-based or 
vector-based, i.e., CxM and dxCxM, respectively. 

The proposed method clearly achieves the goal of efficient class extendibility and 
effective discriminative ability. First, since the visual-word dictionary and image 
representation are category-specific, adding new classes does not require 
reconstruction of all image features related to those in the original class so as to 
minimize reconstruction overhead. Second, since the visual-word construction and 
image representation are category-specific, the corresponding learning model for 
classification should have sufficient discriminatory power. 

Notably, Expectation-Maximization (EM) in Gaussian mixtures [18] rather than 
K- means were used to construct codebooks and to represent images in Ref. [4], which 
improved performance [4, 18]. Thus, EM is also used in this study, and Eq. (4) should 
be updated as follows. Each visual word of the codebook \w' k \k â 1, â¢ â¢ â¢ , Mf, i â 1, â¢ â¢ â¢ , C, 
is first updated as one of Muni-model Gaussian components by the following equation. 

w[=N{x-n- t ,i:' t li = l,--,C,k=l,--,M (5) 

where \i' k and ~L\ denote the mean vector and covariance matrix of the Mi Gaussian 
component and where x denotes the local patch feature. Each patch with features 
x'(n)is then labeled for each category i as a codeword w',i c , >) from the codebook

with f '((',Â£) as defined by the following equation.

Similarly, for the C-C/W-R strategy, Eq. (3) can be updated accordingly if EM in 
Gaussian mixtures is used instead of A"-means to construct codebooks and to represent 
images as in Ref. [4] .

3 Experimental Results 



Performance evaluations are performed using two data sets. One is Scene- 13 dataset 
[2], and the other is Scene- 15 dataset [3]. Each category consists of 200 to 400 images 
with average size of 384x256. The SVM classifier adopted in this study is the LIBSVM 
implemented by Chang and Lin with radial-basis function kernel [19]. 

Each scene image is tiled with dense overlapping patches of fixed size 16x16 and 8 
overlapping pixels. Thus, there are 47x31=1457 patches for each image. The sizes of 
codebook M are 35, 50 and 80. Two local patch features are adopted: Histogram of 
Oriented Gradient (HOG) [20] and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) [17]

which have dimensions of 16 and 128, respectively. Principal component analysis 
(PCA) [18] is applied to SIFT to reduce the SIFT dimension from 128 to 64. The HOG 
dimension is reduced from the 36 bins in the original version [20] to 16 bins. The 
histogram channels from to 360 degrees are divided into 16 sectors, each of which is 
22.5 degrees. Thus, the HOG in this study has 16 bins. 

Experiments are performed to test the performance of the Scene- 13 and Scene- 15 
datasets and the class extendibility of the Scene- 15 dataset. For each issue, experiments 
are repeated ten times with 100 randomly selected images per category for training and 
the rest for testing. 

Tables 1 and 2 show the categorization results for the Scene-13 and Scene-15 
datasets for different features and codebook sizes and for different strategies, 
respectively. The tables show that the proposed method is more accurate compared to 
the C-C/W-R strategy. Moreover, for the Scene-13 dataset, the highest accuracies 
obtained in Ref. [4] are 83.6% with 512 visual words and 84.1% with 1024 visual 
words; in the current study, the accuracies are 85.42% with 13x35=455 visual words 
and 86.65% with 13x80=1040 visual words. For the Scene-15 dataset, the highest 
accuracy in Ref. [4] is 83.5% with 1024 visual words; that in the current study is 
84.06% with 15x80=1200 visual words. However, Ref [4] adopted SIFT feature for the 
Scene-13 dataset but SIFT and coordinate information for the Scene-15 dataset. The 
proposed method adopted only SIFT feature for the Scene-13 and Scene-15 datasets 
consistently. On the other hand, although Ref. [9] adopted C-C/W-R strategy, it obtains 
87.63% and 85.16% accuracies for the Scene-13 and Scene-15 datasets, respectively. 
However, Ref. [9] adopted multi-scale features rather than single-scale feature as in the 
proposed method. Thus, the proposed method has higher accuracy compared to all 
existing methods when single-type and single-scale features are used.

Class extendibility is verified by simulating an increase in the number of classes 
from the original 2 and 5 categories to 15 categories. The experiments were conducted 
only on Scene- 15 dataset. The assumptions are 2 and 5 original categories and 
codebook construction based only on 2 and 5 categories. Suppose that the number of 
categories is increased to 15. In this case, if image representations of the scene images 
in the original 2 and 5 categories are not reconstructed, the codebook categories are still 
Mx2 and Mx5, respectively, rather than Mxl5 in the original C-C/W-R strategy. 
Categorization accuracy is clearly degraded (Table 3). However, the proposed strategy 
can achieve efficient class extendibility easily since image representation is also 
category-specific.

4 Conclusions 

This study developed a scene categorization method with category-specific 
visual-word construction and image representation to enable scene categorization with 
efficient class extendibility and effective discriminative ability. Experimental results 
confirm that the proposed strategy has higher accuracy compared to existing methods 
when single-type and single-scale features are used. Future work can be directed to 
subtle codebook construction, contextual information incorporation, and hierarchical 
scene categorization.

Abstract. In this paper we develop a technique for creating web-educational 
systems which offer adaptive navigation support. Our technique is based on 
fuzzy logic. We represent the dependencies between the domain concepts using 
fuzzy cognitive maps. Also, we choose fuzzy sets to describe student's knowl- 
edge level and cognitive abilities and we use a mechanism of rules over the 
fuzzy sets, which is triggered after any change of the student's knowledge level 
of a domain concept, and update the student's knowledge level of all related 
with this concept, concepts. 



1 Introduction 

The rapid development of information and communication technologies have changed 
the ways of teaching and learning giving rise to the field of web-based education. 
Web-based educational systems offer easy access from everywhere for anyone and 
whenever to knowledge domains and learning processes. Due to the very large audi- 
ence, which consists of learners with different characteristics and needs, that use an e- 
learning system, and the absence of teacher, high adaptivity is required. Adaptive web 
applications have the ability to deal with different users' needs for enhancing usability 
and comprehension and for dealing with large repositories [1]. 

Adaptation is the key to reach the goal of offering each individual student the 
knowledge they need. Adaptive Hypermedia is a research domain that helps to 
achieve adaptivity in web-based educational systems [2]. An adaptation technology of 
adaptive hypermedia is the adaptive navigation support technology that helps students 
to find an "optimal path" through the learning material. Adaptive navigation support 
is a specific group of technologies that support user navigation in hyperspace, by 
adapting to the goals, preferences and knowledge of the individual user [3]. Thus, in 
order to apply adaptive navigation support to a web-based educational system we 
have to model the knowledge, to diagnose the needs, misconceptions and cognitive 
abilities of each individual student. 

Student diagnosis is fraught with uncertainty,. One possible approach to deal with 
this is fuzzy student modelling. Fuzzy sets theory was introduced by Zadeh [4], ac- 
cording to who, the main contribution of Fuzzy logic is a methodology for computing 
with words, which cannot be done equally well with other methods [5]. Thus, Fuzzy 
logic techniques can be used to improve the performance of a web-based educational 
application. Several researchers found fuzzy student modelling as adequate for carry- 
ing out the system's assessment and pedagogical functions [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].

In this paper we describe a fuzzy student modelling. A description of the domain 
knowledge using fuzzy cognitive maps is given first. The description of a student 
modelling using fuzzy techniques follows. The student model is mainly based on the 
student cognitive model. The data from the fuzzy user model is the basis for the sys- 
tem adaptation. 

2 Adaptive Navigation Support 

A web-based educational system is used by students with different needs and cogni- 
tive abilities. Therefore, it is not effective all the learners follow the same instruction 
model. That is, all learners should not read the same material and in the same order. 
Some learners do not need to read some chapters because these are known to them, 
some others have to revise some domain concepts, and others should give more atten- 
tion to some knowledge issues. 

Adaptive hypermedia is the solution for offering adaptive navigation. Adaptive 
navigation support technology support the student in hyperspace orientation and navi- 
gation by adaptively sorting, annotating or partly hide the links that constitute the 
domain knowledge material, to make easier the choice of the next link to proceed 
[13]. ISIS-Tutor [14], ELM-ART[15], InterBook [16], WEST-KBNS [17] and CALL 
[18] are some educational system which apply adaptive navigation support. However, 
which are the criteria, that are the base for adaptive navigation support? Mainly, the 
adaptive navigation support is applied regarding each individual learner's knowledge 
and cognitive needs, as well as the domain concepts of the domain knowledge and 
how they are related with each other. In other words, adaptive navigation support is 
achieved obtaining information about the domain knowledge and about the learner for 
her/his student model. 

3 The Domain Knowledge 

One of the most important components of an adaptive educational application is the 
representation of knowledge. To enable communication between system and learner 
at content level, the domain model of the system has to be adequate with respect to in- 
ferences and relations of domain entities with the mental domain of a human expert 
[19]. Taking this into account, the domain knowledge of a web application can be or- 
ganized into an hierarchical tree, with domain topics as intermediate nodes and learn- 
ing objectives as leaf nodes [20] as it is depicted in figure 1. The full collection of 
domain topics constitutes the whole domain knowledge. Each topic has its learning 
objectives that are classified according to Bloom's taxonomy [21]. Learning objec- 
tives determine the concepts that must be understood and learned in each chapter. The 
hierarchy of the tree depicts the difficulty level of the domain topics and the order in 
which each topic has to be taught.

LOy: Learning Objective j of Domain Concept 



Fig. 1. The tree og the Domain Knowledge 



Furthermore, there are some dependencies among the domain concepts. Lets take 
two depended concepts Ci and Cj . Concept Ci can be a prerequisite of concept Cj , or 
it can follow concept Cj, or the two concepts can belong to the same level of hierar- 
chy. In all these cases the knowledge of the one concept affects the knowledge of the 
other domain concept. We have to make explicit that the knowledge of a domain con- 
cept does not only affect the knowledge of domain concepts that follow in the hierar- 
chy model of the knowledge domain, but also it affects its prerequisite concepts, as 
well as the knowledge of the concepts of the same hierarchy level. That happens be- 
cause the order in which the concepts of the same hierarchy level are read, is not 
determined but it is selected by the learner. Moreover, the knowledge of a concept 
affects the knowledge of a prerequisite domain concept, since their knowledge is 
related. 

The learning of an issue helps to better understanding a depended chapter in some 
degree. Also, the knowledge of a domain concept could not only increase, but also it 
can decrease in some degree, when the knowledge of a depended topic is not satisfac- 
tory. This degree is determined by the experts of the domain knowledge. This kind of 
dependencies among the concepts of the domain knowledge can be depicted using 
fuzzy cognitive maps (figure 2). Fuzzy Cognitive Maps constitute a way to represent 
real-world dynamic systems and they are considered a combination of fuzzy logic and 
artificial neural networks. They are introduced by Kosko [22,23] and have been ap- 
plied to many areas [24, 25, 26, 27], with education and student modelling to be 
among them [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. A Fuzzy Cognitive Map illustrates the whole 
system as a combination of concepts and the various causal relations that exist be- 
tween their concepts [34, 35].The nodes of the map depict the domain concepts, the 
directed arcs which connect the depended domain concepts represent the causal rela- 
tionships and the numbers show the degree in which the knowledge level of a domain 
concept is affected regarding the knowledge of its depended domain concept.

Fig. 2. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps - increasing knowledge 

The arcs in a Fuzzy Cognitive Map can take values in the interval [-1, 1]. A posi- 
tive value indicates a positive causality between concepts Ci and Cj. In other words, 
the increase on the value of Ci leads to the increase on the value of Cj , or the decrease 
on the value of Ci leads to the decrease on the value of Cj . On the other hand, a nega- 
tive value indicates a negative causality between concepts Ci and Cj. That is, the in- 
crease on the value of Ci leads to the decrease on the value of Cj , or the decrease on 
the value of Ci leads to the increase on the value of Cj. In our domain knowledge 
model the increase on the knowledge of a domain concept Ci leads to the increase on 
the knowledge of its depended domain concept Cj , or the decrease on the knowledge 
of a domain concept Ci leads to the decrease on the knowledge of its depended do- 
main concept Cj. Thus, the values of the arcs in our Fuzzy Cognitive Map can be in 
the interval (0, 1]. 

4 Student Modeling 

Student model is mainly based on the student cognitive model. Therefore, we focus 
on which parts of the domain knowledge the student knows and how well. Phrases 
such as "He is very good at domain concept A", "She has a lack of knowledge at do- 
main concept A", "He is moderate at the domain concept B" are vague and imprecise. 
Moreover, statements such as "She knows at 70% the chapter 1", "He succeeded 85% 
in the questions about the chapter 3" do not explicitly state that s/he has assimilated 
the corresponding knowledge issue or s/he has to revise it. Consequently, student's 
knowledge and cognitive abilities representation is imprecise and one possible ap- 
proach to deal with this is fuzzy set techniques, with their ability to naturally represent 
human conceptualization. 

We define the following four fuzzy sets for describing student knowledge of a do- 
main concept: 



â¢ Unknown (Un): the degree of success in the domain concept is from 0% to 60%. 

â¢ Unsatisfactory Known(UK): the degree of success in the domain concept is from 

55% to 75%. 



Adaptive Navigation in a Web Educational System Using Fuzzy Techniques 85 

â¢ Known (K): the degree of success in the domain concept is from 70% to 90%. 

â¢ Learned (L): the degree of success in the domain concept is from 85% to 100%. 
The membership functions for the four fuzzy sets are depicted in diagram 1, and 

are the following:

The following expressions stand:

if |o,uk>0 â * Hl=0 
if Hk>0 * Hun=0 
if Hl>0 â * |!un=HuK=0 



Thus, a quadruplet (u. Url , u. UK , \i K , |i L ) is used to express the student knowledge of a 
domain concept. For example, if a student is succeeding 87% at the domain concept 
Cj, then her/his knowledge state of this domain concept is described by the quadruplet 
(0, 0, 0.6, 0.4), which means that the domain concept of Ci is 60% Known and 40% 
Learned for the student. To determine the knowledge level of a student, the student 
takes a test at the end of each chapter. 



86 C. Konstantina and V. Maria 

A characteristic of many domains knowledge is that the experience and the con- 
tinuous learning process lead to better understanding and assimilation of domain con- 
cepts that have been taught a previous time. Furthermore, if a student performs poorly 
in a chapter, then her/his knowledge level of previous associated chapter has to be re- 
duced. In addition, the learning of some domain concepts helps to better understand- 
ing of chapters that follow. In other words, let's symbolize with Ci -> Cj that there is 
a dependency between the chapters Ci and Cj, and more concretely that chapter Ci 
precedes to chapter Cj, then the following four facts can be happened: 

fl. Considering the knowledge level of Q, the knowledge level of Cj increases. 
f2. Considering the knowledge level of Q, the knowledge level of Cj decreases. 
f3. Considering the knowledge level of Cj, the knowledge level of Q increases. 
f4. Considering the knowledge level of Cj, the knowledge level of Q decreases. 

When f 1 and f3 are happened the student model expands. On the contrary, when f2 
and f4 are happened the student model reduces. In other words, after any change of 
the value of concept knowledge of a domain concept, an inferring mechanism is trig- 
gered that updates the values of all related with this concept, concepts. 

Let's define D the fuzzy set describing the dependencies between the domain con- 
cepts and |Jd(G, Cj) the membership function of the dependency relation of Cj on Ci 
and |iD(Ci, Cj) the membership function of the dependency relation of Ci on Cj. The 
values of (iD(Ci, Cj) |iD(Ci, Cj) are the values of the arcs in the Fuzzy Cognitive Maps 
of the domain knowledge (Figure 1). 

Concerning the precedence relation Q->Cj the knowledge level of the chapters can 
change according the following rules: 

â  Concerning the knowledge level of Q (Cj) the knowledge level of Cj (Q) increases 
according to (SI, S2 are knowledge levels with S1<S2): 

Rl: If Cj (Q) is SI and Q (Cj) is SI, then Cj (Q) remains SI with 

H S1 (Cj)=max[n sl (C j ),n sl (C i )*n D (Q,C j )] 

(H S1 (Q)=max[n sl (C i ),n sl (C i )*n D (C j ,C i )]). 
R2: If Cj (Q) is SI and C, (Cj) is S2, then Cj (Q) becomes S2 with 

Hs2(Cj)=Hs2(C i )*n D (C i ,Cj)(ns2(Q)=Hs2(Cj)*n D (C j ,C i )). 

â  Concerning the knowledge level of Q the knowledge level of Cj reduces according 
to: 

R3: If Cj is 100% Learned, then it does not change. 

R4: If Cj is S and Cj is Unknown, then Cj becomes Unknown with 

M-un(Cj)=|iun(Ci)*HD(Q>Cj). S is knowledge level with S>Unknown. 
R5: If Cj is S and Q is Unsatisfactory Known, then Cj becomes Unsatisfactory 

Known if (i D (Ci,Cj)=l or Known with (i K (Cj)=l-|iuK(Cj)=l-|iuK(Ci)*|iD(Ci,Cj). 

S is knowledge level with S>Unsatisfacory Known. 
R6: If Cj is Partially Learned and Q is Known, then Cj remains Known with 

liK(C j )=n K (Q)*n D (C i ,C j ). 



Adaptive Navigation in a Web Educational System Using Fuzzy Techniques 87 

â  Concerning the knowledge level of Cj the knowledge level of Q reduces according 
to: 

R7: We use the formula pi=min[pj, (l-|i D (Cj, Cj))*pi+Pj], where p t and pj are the 
student's degree of success in Q and Cj respectively, and then using the new 
Pi we determine the new quadruplet (nun, Huk, Hk, M-l) for Q. 
Let's see some examples between the domain concept C 3 and the domain concept 
C 4 . The prerequisite relation is C 3 ->C 4 and |i D (C 3 ,C 4 )=0.81, |i D (C 4 ,C 3 )=l. 

i.Let's consider that C 4 is 40% Learned and the student is being examined at C 3 and 
it is being concluded that C 3 is 100% Learned, so the knowledge level of C 4 will 
increase according to the rule Rl and it will become Learned with 
|i L (C4)=max[n L (C 4 ),|i L (C 3 )*|i D (C 3 ,C 4 )]=max[0.4,l*0.81]=0.81. So, C 4 will become 
81% Learned. 

ii. Let's consider that C 4 is 100%Unsatisfactory Known and the student is being ex- 
amined at C 3 and it is being concluded that C 3 is 30% Unknown, so the knowledge 
level of C 4 will decrease according to the rule R4 and it will become Unknown 
with |i Un (C 4 )=|iun(C 3 )*(i D (C 3 ,C 4 )=0.3*0.81=0.243. So, C* will become 24.3% Un- 
known. 

iii.Let's consider that C 3 is 60%Unknown and the student is being examined at C 4 
and it is being concluded that C 4 is 100% Known, so the knowledge level of C 3 
will increase according to the rule R2 and it will become Known with 
Hk(C 3 )=^(C 4 )*!J,d(C 4 ,C 3 )=1*1=1. So, C 3 will become 100% Known. 

iv. Let's consider that C 3 is 20%Learned and the student is being examined at C 4 and 
it is being concluded that C 4 is 100% Unsatisfactory Known, so the knowledge 
level of C 3 will decrease according to the rule R7. p 3 =min[p 3 ,(l- 
(i D (C 3 ,C 4 ))*p 3 +p 4 ]= min[86, (l-0.81)*68]=min[86, 84.34]=84.34. So the new quad- 
ruplet (|iun, Huk, 11k, M-l) for C 3 is (0,0,1,0). In other words, C 3 will become 100% 
Known. 



5 Discussion on the Fuzzy Cognitive Maps and Fuzzy User 
Modeling Used 

Many web-based educational systems use a network of concepts for representing the 
domain knowledge and the technique of stereotypes in user modelling, in order to pro- 
vide adaptation to students. Such system is CASTLE [36] in which knowledge is organ- 
ized in a network of concepts with nodes representing concepts and arcs representing re- 
lations between concepts (e.g. whether some concepts must be taught before another) 
and each student, according to her/his progress in each domain concept, is characterised 
as novice, beginner, intermediate or advanced. Another system is Web-PTV [37] in 
which knowledge is organised in a network of concepts with nodes representing a cate- 
gory of concepts and arcs representing relations between concepts, that can be "part-of ', 
"is-a" and prerequisite. Based on the student action while interacting with the system, it 
distinguishes between three possible states of concepts, namely "not read", "read and 
not known" and "read and known". Web_Tutor_Pas [38] is another web-based educa- 
tional system that teaches the programming language Pascal. In this system the domain 
knowledge is organised into an hierarchical tree, which depicts the difficulty level of 
each domain topic and the order in which each topic has to be taught. According to 



88 C. Konstantina and V. Maria 

which topics the student knows and at what degree, the system categorised her/him to a 
stereotype which range from "novice" to "expert". 

All these systems use the representation of the domain knowledge in order to de- 
scribe what should be taught and in which hierarchy. Furthermore, the set of the con- 
cepts that are known to a student determine her/his stereotype. The student takes a test 
that concerns each domain concept and her/his answers determine her/his knowledge 
level and thus her/his stereotype. However, the relations between concepts are restricted 
to "part-of ', "is-a" and prerequisite relations. This has as a result the knowledge of a 
concept not to affect the knowledge of another related concept. In other words, the 
knowledge of a domain concept A may means that a percentage of a related domain 
concept B is already known. So, it is possible that the student should not read and be ex- 
amined in domain concept B. Moreover, if the knowledge of domain concept B reduces, 
it is possible that the student has to revise the domain concept A. Therefore, the repre- 
sentation of the domain knowledge should depict this kind of relations between con- 
cepts, except of the hierarchy level. That's why we use Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. 

But, how we use the values of the arcs between 2 concepts in order to determine 
how the knowledge level of a related concept changes? An answer to this constitutes 
the fuzzy logic mechanism that has been introduced by Alenka Kavcic[39]. She uses 
six rules which determine the new knowledge level of an essential prerequisite con- 
cept Cj based on the demonstrated knowledge of the concept Cj. However, she does 
not determine how the knowledge level of the concept Cj is affected by the knowledge 
level of its prerequisite concept Q. Furthermore, the user knowledge in her model al- 
ways expands. Even when the user performs poorly, it never reduces. So, we intro- 
duce our fuzzy logic model in which the user knowledge increases or decreases, ac- 
cording to the user performing, and also the interaction between the knowledge level 
of two related domain concepts is bidirectional. 

6 Conclusion 

Our target in this paper was to develop a technique for creating adaptive web-based 
educational applications. The personalized navigation support is realized due to the 
representation of knowledge domain with fuzzy cognitive maps and to user model 
which adopts fuzzy logic techniques. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps are used to illustrate the 
dependencies that exist between the domain concepts. Due to the fact that student's 
actions, misconceptions and needs are imprecise information, we choose fuzzy logic 
to manage the uncertainty and to describe human descriptions of knowledge and of 
student's cognitive abilities. We use fuzzy sets in order to describe for each domain 
concept how well is known and learned and a mechanism of rules which is triggered 
after any change of the value of concept knowledge of a domain concept, and updates 
the values of concept knowledge of all related with this concept, concepts.

Abstract. The science gateway is important component of many large-scale 
Earth, astronomical, environmental and natural disasters science projects. 
Developing the sciences portals and the science gateways is coverage of 
requirements of large scale sciences such as Earth science, astronomy and all 
sciences which are using grid, cloud or cluster computing and high-performance 
computing infrastructure. The paper shows the main position of visualization in 
Science Gateway and describes architecture of the Visualization Tool (VT), for 
Earth and astrophysics simulations and shows some examples. VT is integrated 
in the web portal, as is e-science gateway for astronomy and astrophysics. 

Keywords: Scientific gateway, Earth science, Grid. 



1 Introduction 

Since 2004 numerous scientific gateways have been developed lot of scientific 
gateways funded by the Tera-Grid Science Gateways program [1]. The gateway 
paradigm requires gateway developers to compile and install scientific applications on 
a variety of HPC clusters available from the resource providers in TeraGrid, to build 
service middleware for the management of the applications, and to develop web 
interfaces for delivering the applications to a user's web browser. Consequently, lot of 
web-service frameworks [2], [3], [4] have been designed and applied in building 
domain-specific science gateways. Some of them enable workflow based on the web 
services [4], but they commonly don't provide solutions to support web interface 
generation. Developers were usually hindered. Usually they need to spend a lot of 
time learning web programming, especially JavaScript and AJAX Technologies to 
implement a user-friendly and interactive web interface to these services. 

Scientific gateways are able to provide a community-centric view, workflow/dataflow 
services and a strong support in accessing the cyber infrastructure including grid and cloud 
based resources. In each of science contexts, scientific gateways play a key role since they 
allow scientists to transparently access distributed data repositories (across several 
domains and institutions) and metadata sources to carry out search & discovery activities, 
as well as visualization and analysis ones, etc. Finally, scientific gateways can play an 
important role in training students (at academic level) in different scientific disciplines, 
attract new users and represent a relevant centralized knowledge repository in the sciences 
context. It is also a collaborative cyber-environment on which researchers working the 
same or similar domains can easily team up to perform computational thinking on 
challenging scientific problems by sharing their computational software tools and

elevating experimental datasets to scientific knowledge and innovative theories. Our paper 
deals with the position of visualization as one of the main components of scientific 
gateway. The scientific web portal - gateway cumulate all types of visualization. This 
paper describes VT for Earth science and for astrophysics, in which is cumulate all types 
of visualization. 

Visualization tool is a part of gateway and proposes a new web based application 
framework for Earth science and astrophysics environment. The framework including 
the can import the astronomy specific workflow scripts easily can generate web 
appliance for running astronomical application workflows and visualization the 
outputs results directly from workflow execution, online visualization through their 
web browsers. 

2 Visual Representation of Datasets 

Simulation and execution with a huge data usually spend long execution time. Good 
solution for execution is represented by grid and actually on cloud computing. In both 
infrastructures visualization has the main position as a way to control the execution 
process. Visual control has in all infrastructure very useful position. The modal 
parametric studies applications include, for example, astronomical simulations. The 
simulation was realized as a sequence of parameter studies, where each sub- 
simulation was submitted to the grid as a separate parameter study. The job 
management was rather time consuming due to the analysis of failed jobs and to their 
re-submission. 

Visualization is included as a visual control process. Client asks for visualization is 
a "visualization client". Output data on the storage element are the inputs data for 
visualization jobs. Visualization workers are to modify data to the formats, which can 
be visualized, but also to prepare the typical visualization scenes. Client can render 
such scenes on the browser, can make the visual control and modify executions. For 
example, to immediately understand the evolution of the investigated proto-planetary 
disc we have developed a Visualization Tool (VT). The VT is composed of several 
modules, which are responsible for creating scenes and converting data to, the 
"visualize": format. The VT is designed as a plug-in module. The components 
generating rendering scenes are easy to exchange, according to the requirements of 
the given application. In case of our gridified application the output data of the 
simulation located on the SE can be used directly as the input for the VT. The final 
product of the VT includes a set of files containing data in the VRML (Virtual Reality 
Modeling Language) format. These output files can be rendered by many available 
VRML web-browsers. The whole visualization process is maintained through a 
visualization script, whose basic function is invoking the individual VT components 
in successive steps, transferring data, and handling error events. The script is written 
using the Bourne shell scripts and all VT modules are implemented in the C++ 
language. The VT can be embedded into the framework described above, or can be 
used separately as a stand-alone program. By using the on-line VT the client can stop 
the execution process, change the input parameters and restart the execution process 
again. In grid environment, such architecture can be used for all applications from 
different science spheres which have the character of a parametric study. 



Visualization Tool for Scientific Gateway 93 

Actually, the research community needs not only "traditional" batch computations 
of huge bunches of data but also the ability to perform complex data processing; this 
requires capabilities like on-line access to databases, interactivity, fine real-time job 
control, sophisticated visualization and data management tools (also in real time), 
remote control and monitoring. The user can completely control the job during 
execution and change the input parameters, while the execution is still running. Both 
tools, the tool for submission designed before and continued sequential visualization 
tool, provide complete solution of the specific main problem in Grid environment. 
The position of the visualization tool as a visual control process is shown in figure 1 . 
Astrophysics scientists are able to run scientific simulations, data analysis, and 
visualization through web browsers. 

Through Earth and astronomical science gateway scientists are able to import they 
sophisticated scripts by which the VT can be activated as well, as the output from 
workflow executions without writing any web related code [5]. 

2.1 VT as a New Discovery for Presenting Academic Research Results 

Advance in sciences and engineering results in high demand of tools for high- 
performance large-scale visual data exploration and analysis. For example, 
astronomical scientists can now study evolution of all Solar systems on numerous 
astronomical simulations. These simulations can generate large amount of data, 
possibly with high resolution (in three-dimensional space), and long time series. 
Single-system visualization software running on commodity machines cannot scale up 
to the large amount of data generated by these simulations. To address this problem, 
a lot of different grid-based visualization frameworks have been developed for time- 
critical, interactively controlled file-set transfer for visual browsing of spatially and 
temporally large datasets in a grid environment. To address the problem, many 
frameworks for grid and cloud based visualization are used. We can go through 
evolution of sophisticated grid-based visualization frameworks with actualized 
functionality, for example, Reality Grid, UniGrid and TerraGrid. 

All of the frameworks have been included in the visualization. Frameworks were 
created during grid-based projects and create new features for presentations of the 
academic research results in visualization. Visualization resources enabled by the 
astronomical science gateway the top of research experiences. 

Multiple visualizations generated from a common model will improve the process 
of creation, reviewing and understanding of requirements. Visual representations, 
when effective, provide cognitive support by highlighting the most relevant 
interactions and aspects of a specification for a particular use. The goal of scientific 
visualization is to help scientists view and better understand their data. This data can 
come from experiments or from numerical simulations. Often the size and complexity 
of the data makes them difficult to understand by direct inspection. Also, the data may 
be generated at several times during an experiment or simulation and understanding 
how the data varies with time may be difficult. Scientific visualization can help with 
these difficulties by representing the data so that it may be viewed in its entirety. In 
the case of time data varying in time, animations can be created that show this 
variation in a natural way. Using virtual reality techniques, the data can be viewed 
and handled naturally in a true three-dimensional environment (e.g. depth is explicitly

perceived and not just implied). All these techniques can allow scientists to better 
understand their data. Viewing the data in this way can quickly draw the scientist's 
attention to interesting and/or anomalous portions of the data. Because of this, we 
encourage scientists to use scientific visualization from the beginning of their 
experiments and simulations and not just when they think they have everything 
operating correctly. This also allows scientists to develop a set of visualization tools 
and techniques that will help them understand their data as their research matures. For 
example, depending on of our astronomical example, in order to understand 
immediately the evolution of the investigated proto-planetary disc we have developed 
a Visualization Tool (VT) for astronomers. 

2.2 Architecture of Visualization Tool 

3D visualization service for animation of natural disasters applications, astrophysical 
applications and all complicated applications based on HPC (High Performance 
Computing), grid and Cloud computing should integrate visualization requests. Many 
applications from this area are using different kinds of simulation tools, which 
produce output data for displaying the computation results. The purpose of the 
visualization service is to model and display the results of various simulations. Such 
service requires unified standards such as integration of input data formats and 
especially creation of unified visualization tools. 

When running parametric simulation with a large number of jobs (such 
astrophysical simulations), the main problem was in the grid infrastructure reliability. 
The job management was rather time consuming due to the analysis of failed jobs and 
to their re-submission. Moreover, the jobs, waiting in a queue for a long time, were 
blocking the simulation. To overcome these problems, we developed an easy-to-use 
framework based on pilot jobs concept that uses only services and technologies 
available in EGEE (Enabling grids for E-science) infrastructure, grid middleware 
gLite and Bourne Shell scripting language. The framework consists of pilot jobs - 
workers, and of automatic job management script. Workers are running the 
application code in cycle with input datasets downloaded from a storage element 
using remote file access. The storage element contains the input, working and output 
areas (as subdirectories of the directory created by the user for each parameter study). 
The user prepares input datasets on user interface and transfers them into the input 
area before starting the simulation. The working area is used by workers to store static 
information about computing nodes (name of the computing element and computing 
node, CPU type and available memory), and to monitor information updated in 
regular intervals, datasets, that are currently processed, and statistics about processed 
datasets. Output data is stored into the output area, where the user can see the progress 
of simulation. To check the progress, the user only needs to list the contents of the 
output folder. The storage element is accessible also for grid FTP clients, therefore 
grid portals can also be used to watch the progress. To identify hanging jobs or jobs 
that perform too slowly, workers are periodically sending monitoring information to 
the storage element. To avoid termination of workers by the queuing system, workers 
are running only for a limited time. The main function of the job management script is 
to maintain the defined number of active workers with detection of failed 
submissions, finished and waiting workers. The script uses job collections to speed up

the start up and automatic blacklisting of full and erroneous sites. In case of our 
application the output data of the simulation located on the storage element can be 
directly used as the input for the visualization tool. The whole process is shown in 
Fig. 1. The architecture of the submission process is shown in figure 2 (left). The 
architecture of the visualization process is shown in figure 2 (right).

In this paper, we present a visualization tool which has been used on parametric 
astrophysical simulations and natural disaster simulations. The first simulation project 
is a collaboration among Astronomical Institute (Slovakia), Catania Observatory 
(Italy) and Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan (Poland). The second project 
performed natural disasters simulations computed at our institute. The applications 
were ported to EGEE grid infrastructure by the Institute of Informatics Slovak 
Academy of Sciences (Slovakia) [6], [7]. 

Natural disasters simulation is a very complicated, challenging problem sensitive 
to the input data required. Therefore, intense research and development o 
sophisticated software systems and tools is extremely important for natural disasters 
fighting management purposes. For example for Slovak forests, original methodology 
for forest vegetation classification and new fuel models have been developed and 
proper forest fire simulations related to the locality Krompla (National Park Slovak 
Paradise), where the large destructive and its reconstruction have been analyzed. 
These efforts induced the need of better auxiliary tools for 3D visualization o obtained 
simulation results and for animation of the forest fire spread. The importance is 
increasingly expanded for environmental problems.

VT tool for astronomical applications provides pictures from simulation of the 
evolution of proto-planetary disc from lMyr to 1000 Myr. An unsolved question of 
the Solar System cosmogony is the origin of comets and minor bodies with respect to 
the Solar System evolution [7]. In the past, authors predicted the existence of 
reservoirs of the objects and tried an effort to explain the origin and subsequent 
evolution of these reservoirs. Several partial theories have been developed to clarify 
the problem. Recently, the researchers try to present a unified theory of the formation 
of small-body reservoirs in the Solar System (the Kuiper Belt, the Scattered Disc), 
situated beyond the orbit of Neptune. In our application we developed a new 
improved model for explaining the formation of the Oort Cloud. One has to assume 
dynamical evolution of a high number of particles under gravitational influence of the 
giant planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, the Galactic Tide and nearby passing 
alien stars. Before our work, only two similar simulations have been performed by 
Duncan et al. in 1987 and by Dones et al. in 2005 [8]. In our application we assumed 
10038 test particles. It is several times more than in the previous simulations. Our 
extensive simulations required very large computing capacity. To complete our model 
on a single 2.8GHz CPU would last about 21 years. Using the grid infrastructure, the 
whole computation lasted 5 months; thus, it was more than 40 times faster. The result 
of our simulation is dynamical evolution of orbits of test particles during the first giga 
year of the Solar System lifetime. Detailed study of this first giga year evolution 
results in a general agreement with the results of previously mentioned models as well 
as in new facts and questions. Having used the mentioned visualization tool we obtain 
Specifically, Figure 4 shows the evolution of proto-planetary disc in the time of 1 
Myr. We can see that during the 1000 Myr time that the particles were replaced from 
inside to outside of the spheres. Pictures show the result of dynamical evolution of 
Oort-cloud as a part of proto-planetary disk after its evolutionary stage which was the 
first Gyr (giga year) [6].

2.3 Directly Visual Education Form 

Educational visualization uses a simulation normally created on a computer to 
develop an image of something so it can be taught about. This is very useful when 
teaching a topic which is difficult to see otherwise, for example, proto-planetary disk, 
its evolution or evolution in Solar system. It can also be used to view past events, 
such as looking at the Solar system during its evolution stage, or look at things that 
are difficult. For astronomers, the VT has in education roles well. 



3 Conclusion 

The goal of the paper was to describe the VT architecture and to support the 
visualization as essential component in new portals - gateways technologies and to 
show some examples. For the future we want to extend the use of the VT for other 
scientific disciplines in addition to astronomy, but also for Earth Sciences with all 
visualization aspects. Now we are preparing the proposal for a new project of a new 
astronomical sciences gateway. For the future we plan to participate in a project in 
which the main activity will be to create and operate a pan-European e-Science

Abstract. Plane and solid geometry are important disciplines for mathematics, 
computer graphics and physics. In this article, different issues concerning 
geometry concepts are raised and discussed. First, it was observed that there is a 
lack of knowledge of geometrical concepts and entities among math teachers at 
the level of middle school, among college students and among middle school 
students. Second, in order to quantify the level of knowledge about basic 
geometrical entities, a questionnaire made of nine items was distributed and 
data was collected from 15 math teachers, 90 college students and 180 
elementary (6 grade) and middle school students (7 and 8 grades). Third, an 
action plan which aims to teach some geometrical entities is suggested. It is 
recommended in this article to start teaching geometry at the kindergarten using 
different types of real objects and tools. Among the many possible tools, digital 
text (multimedia) is considered to be very important due to its several natural 
inputs to the human sensory system. 



I Introduction 

The fundamental rules of geometry go all the way back to the time of the ancient 
Egyptians and Greeks, who used geometry to calculate the diameter of the earth and 
the distance to the moon. They employed the laws of Euclidean geometry (named 
after Euclid, a Greek mathematician who lived in the 3rd century B.C.). Euclidean 
plane geometry involves points and lines on perfectly flat surfaces. In plane geometry, 
certain starting concepts aren't defined formally, but are considered intuitively 
obvious. The point and the line are examples. A point can be envisioned as an 
infinitely tiny sphere, having height, width, and depth all equal to zero, but 
nevertheless possessing a specific location. A line can be thought of as an infinitely 
thin, perfectly straight, infinitely long wire (Gibilisco, 2003, Hartshorne, 2000). 

One might ask, "Why should we study geometry?" One possible answer to this 
question is given by Bursill-Hall, who claims that at least at one level, the answer is 
quite surprisingly simple. Over most of the last two and a half thousand years in the 
European or Western tradition, geometry has been studied because it has been held to 
be the most exquisite, perfect, paradigmatic truth available to us outside divine 
revelation. It is the surest, clearest way of thinking available to us. Studying geometry

reveals - in some way - the deepest true essence of the physical world. And teaching 
geometry trains the mind in clear and rigorous thinking (Bursill-Hall, 2002). 

Geometry is a basic discipline, it has many applications, it is found in most of the 
other disciplines. Einstein initiated and stressed the role of geometry in fundamental 
physics. Fifty years after his death the links between geometry and physics (General 
relativity, electro-magnetism, quantum mechanics, nuclear forces, string theory, M- 
theory, topology) have been significantly extended with benefits to both sides 
(Atiyah, 2005). 

Geometric concepts not only are used by sciences, but rather one can find 
geometric shapes in the fields of arts and buildings. Geometric patterns occur in rich 
profusion throughout Islamic cultures. They are found on diversity of materials - 
tiles, bricks, wood, brass, paper, plaster, glass and on many types of objects. They 
occur on carpets, windows, doors, screens, railings, bowls, furniture-specially pulpits 
in mosques, and on other surfaces. They can be seen in abundance in Persian 
miniatures in the illumination of the Holy Koran and on architectural surfaces of 
mosques, palaces, madersas (centres of education) and tombs (Abas, 2001). 

Teachers, while exploring how individuals develop "different paths on their own 
cognitive journey of personal mathematical growth", Tall discusses about three 
worlds of mathematics: conceptual, symbolic, and formal (Singera and Voicab, 2008). 

One of the main pedagogical tasks that mathematics teachers engage on daily basis 
when teaching geometry is choosing appropriate activities considering: the content 
they are teaching, and their students' background. There are many different 
frameworks and instruments that have been developed (classical and computer based) 
in recent years to evaluate the quality of various educational technology applications. 
In their paper, Manizade and Mason propose a framework for teachers' decision 
making when assessing appropriateness of GeoGebra applications available on-line 
for teaching a specific geometric content (Manizade and Mason, 2010). 

The attractiveness of using technological tools (computers) relies on their 
multimedia capabilities and networking which could foster students' abilities, 
revolutionize the way they work and think, and give them new access to the world 
(Peck and Dorricott, 1994). More than that, Dynamic geometry systems have been 
described as computational environments that embody some sub domain of 
mathematics or science, generally using linked symbolic and graphical 
representations. Through computers' environment and dynamic geometry 
environments especially can allow students to explore the various solution paths 
individually and in small groups in which they make decisions and receive feedback 
on their ideas and strategies. Creating visual mathematical representation in the 
software can make it easier for students to grasp the relevant concepts by allowing the 
continuous manipulation of mathematical objects in real time. Teachers can thus 
improve their students' knowledge by eliciting mental schemas from them, which is 
to say the students can be guided to reach conclusions which form a step-by- step 
visual proof (Patsiomitou, 2008). 

Another example of using computers to teach geometry concepts is given by 
Benacka, who developed examples to show an unusual way of using spreadsheets as a 
3D computer graphics tool. The applications can serve as a simple introduction to the 
general principles of computer graphics, to the graphics with spreadsheets, and as a 
tool for exercising stereoscopic vision. The presented approach is usable at

visualizing 3D scenes within some topics of secondary school curricula as solid 
geometry (angles and distances of lines and planes within simple bodies) or analytic 
geometry in space (angles and distances of lines and planes in E3), and even at 
university level within calculus at visualising graphs of z = f(x,y) functions. Examples 
are pictured (Benacka, 2008). 

A persistent dilemma for teachers of mathematics concerns how to help children 
understand abstract concepts, such as addition and multiplication, and the symbols 
that are used to represent these concepts. Teachers face a double challenge. Symbols 
may be difficult to teach to children who have not yet grasped the concepts that they 
represent. At the same time, the concepts may be difficult to teach to children who 
have not yet mastered the symbols. Not surprisingly, both teachers and mathematics 
researchers have called for better techniques to help children learn mathematical 
concepts and symbols (Uttal et. AL, 1997). 

Hanna addressed the situation in the Israel, noting that the Israeli educational 
system has suffered substantial deterioration from the early 60ies until now. 
Furthermore; the level of the Israeli matriculation certificate has gradually declined 
and its value has reached a minimal stage (Hanna, 2010). From personal experience, 
while teaching for several years: mathematics, physics to mechanical engineering 
students and introduction to computer graphics, it was observed that the level of 
knowledge about basic geometric concept is very weak. Furthermore, it was observed 
that understanding and visualizing points and line are very difficult for most of the 
students. 

In section 2, the geometry standards for young students are reviewed. The method 
- questionnaire and data collection are addressed in section 3. A model of action - 
teaching geometry basics using digital text in the kindergarten is described in 
section 4 and finally summary and conclusions are given in section 5. 

2 Review Standards 

The following review is based on the paper of Clements and Sarama, who addressed 
the NCTM standards of teaching geometry and early stages (Clements and Sarama, 
2000) with suggestions of teaching. 

From prekindergarten to grade 12, the Geometry Standard addresses four main 
areas:properties of shapes, location and spatial relationships, transformations and 
symmetry, and visualization. 

Properties of shapes: The NCTM's Standards document states that instructional 
programs for grades pre- K-12 should enable all children to "analyze characteristics 
and properties of two- and three-dimensional geometric shapes and develop 
mathematical arguments about geometric relationships" . The expectations for the 
early years are that children should â 

â¢ recognize, name, build, draw, compare, andsort two- and three-dimensional 
shapes; 

â¢ describe attributes and parts of two- and threedimensionalshapes; and 

â¢ investigate and predict the results of putting shapes together and taking them 
apart. 



102 M. Huleihil and H. Huleihil 

Do teachers need to address these ideas with very young children? Yes! Young 
children's ideas about shapes â including limited ideas â stabilize as early as six years 
old. If a six-year-old believes, for example, that non-isosceles triangles are not 
triangles, he or she will likely continue to believe that misconception for years to 
come â regardless of what the teacher or a textbook says. 

Location and spatial relationships: The Standards document states that pre-K-12 
students should be able to " specify locations and describe spatial relationships using 
coordinate geometry and other representational system s". Young children should â 

â¢ describe, name, interpret, and apply ideas of relative position in space; 

â¢ describe, name, interpret, and apply ideas of direction and distance in navigating 
space; and 

â¢ find and name locations with simple relationships, such as "near to," and use 
coordinate systems, such as those in maps. 

Moving and mapping on computers Computer activities can facilitate children's 
learning of navigational and map skills. Young children can abstract and generalize 
directions and measurement by working with navigation environments that require 
them to direct a car or an animal around the screen. One kindergartner abstracted the 
geometric notion of path by saying, "A path is like the trail a bug leaves after it walks 
through purple paint." Simple coordinate games on computers can help children learn 
location ideas. For example, the on-screen version of Battleship requires players to 
guess a location by given coordinates, such as "B, 5." When children enter a 
coordinate to move an object but it goes to a location that is different from what they 
had planned, the feedback is natural and meaningful. 

Transformations and Symmetry:The Standards document states that pre-K-12 
students should " apply transformations and use symmetry to analyze mathematical 
situations ". Young children should â 

â¢ "recognize and apply slides, flips, and turns";and 

â¢ "recognize and create shapes that have symmetry." 

Geometric motions: Children use geometric motions intuitively when they solve 
puzzles. They turn the pieces, flip them over, and slide them into place. If they use 
computer programs to solve puzzles, they must choose each motion deliberately. Such 
activities help students become aware of the motions and the result of each one. They 
also learn that changing an object's position or orientation does not change its size or 
shape. 

Symmetry: Many activities help children explore symmetry. Children's unit-block 
buildings frequently display symmetry. Teachers can help the children make 
symmetric shapes using mirrors and by folding and cutting paper. Children can also 
explore symmetry by using computers. Activities that ask children to complete the 
other "half of a symmetric design or explore pattern-block designs with built-in 
mirrors allow children to explore symmetry dynamically. The design explored in such 
activities is always symmetric.

103 



Visualization: The Standards document recommends that pre- K-12 students " use 
visualization, spatial reasoning, and geometric modeling to solve problems ". Young 
children should â 

â¢ form mental images of geometric shapes by using spatial memory and 
spatial visualization ; 

â¢ recognize and represent objects from different points of view; 

â¢ relate geometric ideas to number and measurement ideas; and 

â¢ recognize and locate geometric shapes and structures in the environment. 

Activities based on exploring real objects and playing yard games, could enhance 
visualization. Computer programs (e.g. MsPaint, Excel, and PowerPoint) are essential 
for developing imagination through pictures, sounds and animation. 

3 Method - Data Collection and Observations 

In order to check the level of knowledge about basic geometric entities, a 
questionnaire made of nine items were prepared. The questionnaire were distributed 
among elementary and middle school math teachers (15 teachers who work in 6 
different schools), among college students (90) and among elementary and secondary 
school students (180, 6 th -8 th grades). The questionnaire included open items, which 
allowed the questioners to express their knowledge in free written text. The 
questionnaire and the collected data were arranged in the following table.

about items 1 to 5, but; 2) there is al little knowledge about items 6 to 10. Although 
plane geometry is taught to all students at the middle age level, it is interesting to note 
that the concept of a plane is not clear to the them.

Observations from the elementary and middle age school students' responses : 

elementary and middle school students showed a little knowledge about geometry 
concepts. 

A general result which is obvious from the answers of all the questioners' 
responses is the lack of knowledge about solid geometry. 

The observed lack of knowledge of basic geometric concepts, probably starts at early 
ages and continues towards university level. One of the main reasons for this 
phenomenon might be explained by the fact that teachers adopt Piaget theory of 
cognitive development. Piaget identified four stages in cognitive development: sensory- 
motor, pre-operational, concrete, and formal (Balke and Pope, 2008).According to 
Piaget theory, teachers cannot teach concepts if the students did not reach appropriate 
mental level. Thus, teachers while adopting Piaget theory, with the difficulty of 
identifying the proper age, they limit themselves from introducing abstract concepts at 
early stages. This limitation propagates through the years as one might observe while 
teaching physics and introduction to computer graphics at the university level. 

A solution to this problem, might stem from adopting Vygotsky's theory of 
cognitive development. Vygotsky developed concepts of cognitive learning zones. 
The Zone of Actual Development (ZAD) occurs when students can complete tasks on 



108 M. Huleihil and H. Huleihil 

their own. On the other hand, Vygotsky suggests that students are able to grasp 
abstract concepts at the age of eight Balke and Pope, 2008). 

According to our observations regarding the level of knowledge of the basic 
geometric concepts, we suggest that these concepts should be taught starting at early 
childhood. 

In the following section we propose computer based activities for teaching points 
and lines in the kindergarten. 

4 Digital Based Activities at the Kindergarten 

When young students are asked about points and lines, usually they draw a dot and a 
straight segment on a piece of paper, pointing to either one of each and claiming: "this 
is a point, this is a line". The difficulty to describe a point by words is raised due to 
the fact that a point is an abstract concept with no size. Thus, it is difficult to visualize 
it. So, the first mission of a teacher is to help in constructing an image in the student's 
memory. This could be done by variety of methods, including real objects, stories, 
games, and computer graphical programs. Based on its definition, i.e., a point, 
actually, is an expression of a location one might reach or specify, it should be easy to 
link the point concept to some location in the neighboring environment (trees or any 
object could be found in the neighborhood) or in the distant space (the moon, the sun, 
and the stars). At the kindergarten, there are many hours of watching educational 
movies, which could be used to address many locations in the outer space, on the 
surface of our planet and in the near neighborhood. Insects, e.g., Ants or Bees could 
be viewed as points (a misconception that should be relaxed in later stages of 
development). Afterwards, Ants or Bees could be traced to describe lines (straight or 
curved). These real activities are helpful and are used as complementary and pre (and 
/ or simultaneously) to computer activities which are described next. 

4.1 Using Graphical Programs (Mspaint) 

Microsoft paint is an example of a graphical program which emulates the computer 
screen as an array of pixels (which could be seen as models for points). Then young 
students could draw dots with different sizes (by choosing different brush sizes). The 
students brainstorm with the teacher the concept of a point by relating to the size of 
the dot been drawn on the screen. The discussion is accompanied with drawing 
smaller and smaller dots. Along with this activity, the young students classify fruits 
and arrange them in a row from biggest to smallest. The occupied position of each 
dot or each fruit is highlighted and pointed to. 

The next concept is a Line. A line is defined as an infinite set of points which spans 
a specified direction. Thus, the graphical program facilitates visualizing the concept. 
The real world activity could be of arranging lentils in a line. The concept of infinity 
could be easily discussed with young students due to the practical limitation of the 
amount they could bring from home (mass and money. In a summer day, while 
visiting the fields, Ants could be traced and photographed via a digital camera, and in 
a later time, the pictures should be viewed at the computer screen. The dual activity is 
important to establish concepts in the memory of the learners. 



Digital Text Based Activity: Teaching Geometrical Entities at the Kindergarten 109 

Graphical programs are ideal for demonstrating and clarifying concepts like 
symmetry, rotation, axis of rotation, drawing shapes (in 2D and 3d). The interactive 
feature of such activities increases the effectiveness of the learning process. 

4.2 Using Slide Shows (PowerPoint) 

Slide shows are perfect for animating locations (points), paths (straight lines) and 
shapes. These concepts (and other concepts) are visualized as moving graphical 
objects and entities. Building educational slideshow movies with the young students 
is powerful for grasping new concepts, including abstract ides. Again, acting in a dual 
fashion is essential to the process of learning. Some ideas of slideshow movies which 
are important for the young children are: crossing traffic lights with adults 
(highlighting the proper behavior expected from them) highlighting dangers following 
wrong behaviors, an activity which is a perfect match to a slideshow movie; a race 
between rabbits; the eagle and the rabbit (up-down, sky-earth). 

4.3 Using Digital Cameras 

Digital cameras linked to distant computers are used in some kindergartens in Israel, 
as a necessity for the parents. Recently, there were objection to use digital cameras 
due to exposing the children and the staff continuously. For the current interest, 
digital cameras are excellent choice to facilitate the process of learning. Digital 
cameras, with the ability of capturing movies enable performing the dual activities 
simultaneously. The special location of the giraffe kindergarten (which is located in 
south of Israel-Rahat city), in the desert with green neighborhood (trees and 
vegetables planted by the teacher and young students) enables simultaneous dual 
activities (e.g. capturing the plants growth, each plant in its specified location (Fig. 1), 
capturing insects (Fig. 2) and other available things (e.g. the moon Fig. 3).

4.4 Using Spreadsheets (EXCEL) 

Spread sheets are good candidates for visualizing points. By formatting the cell width 
and height, it is possible to test different cell sizes, starting from bigger cells to 
smaller cells. Coloring activity enables practicing mouse movements and reaching

different locations. Painting cells in some organized manner makes it possible to 
make different shapes (horizontal lines, vertical lines, slanted lines, squares, triangles, 
rectangles, circles, trees, and any possible shape. Excel is ideal of creating XY charts. 
With the ability of macros, drawing points, lines and shapes could be simulated and 
animated by applying the built-in DoEvents macro. 

5 Summary and Conclusions 

In this article, the basic geometric concepts (point, straight line, ray, angle, parallel 
lines, plane, space and axis) were discussed. Three main points were raised: 1) the 
level of knowledge of basic geometric concepts were observed to be weak among 
teachers at elementary and middle age Arab schools, among college students and 
among elementary and middle age students (6 th -8 th ); 2) the aforementioned level of 
knowledge were quantified and data were collected via an open questionnaire which 
included 9 geometric concepts (table #1). The sample size included 15 teachers from 

6 schools, 90 college students and 180 elementary and middle age students; 3) and 
finally an action plan in the form of digital text based activities were suggested to 
teach geometric concepts starting at the kindergarten. 

The results were arranged in tables (2-4). The observations that one can read in the 
tables are as follows: 1) the teachers showed some fair knowledge about concepts 1- 
5; 2) the college students showed some knowledge about concepts 1-5; 3) the 
elementary and middle age students showed weak knowledge about all the concepts; 
4) all the groups showed very weak knowledge about solid geometry. 

Due to the fact that these basic concepts are abstract in their nature, it is difficult 
for the students to visualize them. Based on this understanding, the first mission of the 
math teacher is to construct these concepts in the memory of the learners via 
appropriate activities (which include real objects and computer based visualization). 

Following Vygotsky's theory for cognitive development (opposing Piaget's theory 
for cognitive development, which accounts for four stages of development) assuming 
that young students are able to grasp abstract concepts, the following computer 
software types were applied in the giraffe kindergarten which located at south of 
Israel, in the Rahat city: 1) mspaint as a graphical tool; 2) Microsoft PowerPoint for 
preparing slideshow movies; 3) digital cameras as a tool for documentation and 
capturing movies; and 4) Microsoft Excel (spreadsheet) as a simulation and animation 
tool. The computer based activities accompanied with real world activities empowers 
the process of learning. 

This type of implementation, just started in the giraffe kindergarten, showed 
positive and promising results expressed in the observed motivation among the young 
learners. Accordingly, we suggest that this type of dual action plan should be 
implemented for teaching geometric concepts starting from the kindergarten to 
university level. After all , it is difficult to specify the exact moment when the 
students are ready to accept abstract concepts and when they reach the level of 
abstract thinking.

Cross Format Embedding of Metadata in Images 

Using QR Codes

Abstract. Image steganography has various usages due to the recent 
advances in technology, specially in the field of data communication. 
Even though steganography has been used so far mostly to secretly em- 
bed data, we make use of it for embedding cleartext data, which everyone 
can has access. This work proposes a new method for cross format meta- 
data embedding in images that is based on QR codes, that seems to have 
several significant advantages over current method of storing metadata. 

Keywords: steganography, QR codes, LSB, image metadata. 



1 Introduction 

Steganography has been used for centuries and it is only recently that it has 
become a standardized, well studied and formalized part of computer science. 
The main reason for its adoption is its core nature, the fact that it enables us to 
embed messages in other mediums. The fact that current technology gives us the 
privilege to communicate using several medias, compared to the past and that 
it enables others to have access to communication via covert channels, triggers 
a need for privacy and secrecy. 

Of course steganography can have malicious applications, depending on the 
nature of the content of the message that is embedded in the medium, yet as a 
knife can be used for good or malicious objectives, steganography has more to 
offer. In the past years, steganography has been widely used for watermarking 
and applying DRM in images, audio and video assets, as it doesn't alter the 
mediums significantly and the quality remains the same. 

Image steganography has several techniques, the most famous is LSB embed- 
ding, where the data are being stored on the least semantic bits, so that they 
are not detectable by the eye. Moreover, if the pixels that are used are picked 
using a good and secure pseudo-random function, then the embedded informa- 
tion remains secure. Other techniques use the frequency domain like DCT and 
DWT. A good introduction to steganographic techniques is given in |1I2| . 

This work tries to make use of QR codes in order to embed image metadata 
inside them. The reason for doing so is that when changing image format meta- 
data, which in many cases are very useful, are lost. Our approach towards this 
problem is to alter the image and embed the metadata in the image, so that 
if lossless image formats are used, then the metadata remain untouched. The

proposed method provides several advantages that are going to be discussed in 
the following sections. 

2 QR Codes 



Barcodes are being used for more than three decades in order to help us extract 
data from databases about the objects to which they are attached. From product 
prices to blood rhesus and phenotype, barcodes have proved to be very beneficial. 
Yet, they have an inherent problem due to their structure. Barcodes are not 
suitable to store information, but only tags about the information that can later 
be used to identify it using a proper database. 

QR codes come to fill in this gap, as they are a generalization of barcodes. 
These codes can be regarded as the two dimensional version of barcode and have 
started gaining wider acceptance as an industry standard. The name is from 
the initials of "Quick Response" and depending on the standard that will be 
used may contain several thousands bytes of information. Semacode |3], which 
is very popular as well, is another form of two dimensional barcodes and has 
been developed to store mainly URLs, thus their structure does not store much 
information. Both of these codes resemble a crossword puzzle but follow special 
patterns in order to store the information and be easily read from mobile devices. 

Due to the development of smart-phones, QRs have found their way on the 
market, being used by many applications on iOS and Android mobile platforms. 
An example of a QR and its anatomy is presented in Figure l??l For extensive 
information on QR codes and its standards the reader may refer to [5]-

3 Our Proposal 

The use of QR in steganography has already been made |5I6I7| , but the applica- 
tions of the proposed method are wider and more generic. 



Cross Format Embedding of Metadata in Images Using QR Codes 115 



The proposed algorithm takes as input the data to be stored in QR form and 
a random seed R. The random seed is stored in a 32 by 32 square which is stored 
in the upper left corner of the picture using LSB. The result is that the image 
is divided as in Figure l??l as an alternative, the first row of the pixels of the 
image can be used as the random seed. We use the upper square in order to 
create to more rectangles which will store information like, what type of content 
is stored, what is the size of the QRs how they are arranged or even the hash of 
the embedded QRs. 

The random seed R is used in order to initialize a pseudo random permutation 
P which will scramble the QR squares in the image. After the scramble, the QRs 
are embedded in the image by altering the least significant bits of the image. 
The extraction process is exactly the reverse. On receiving the image, we extract 
R and we have the random permutation, thus by using P _1 we can find the bits 
which that are embedded in the QRs. 

Both the embedding and extraction processes can be seen in Figure [31

4 Results 



The tests that are presented in this work were made with grayscale pictures, but 
could easily be applied to full color ones. Figure l??l shows several well known 
"free" images and the image after QR embedding. For the images that we used in 
our experiments, we made some image measurements and the results can be seen 
in Table [TJ The next two figures, Figure [??] and Figure l??l show two distorted 
images and the recovered QR. Due to the structure of the QR and the scrambled 
embedding of it at the image a noise removal filter can improve the quality of 
the retrieved QR when the watermarked image was distorted. The QR can also 
be used as a fragile watermark and in his scrabbled form is possible to show a 
pattern of distortion in the altered image Figure [??] (b) .

5 Applications 



The proposed method has several advantages to offer with its usage. Firstly it 
enables independent cross format metadata over lossless image formats, thus 
important data like creator, dates etc can be easily embedded and transmitted 
without any losses if the image is saved in another format. Moreover, a stan- 
dardized metadata embedding can prove to be an ideal method for speeding up 
image searches on the Internet, through search engines. 

Secondly, the method can be used to compress usual HTML code. Since the 
anchor (<a>) tag in common HTML code is very usual, it can be embedded 
inside the picture compressing usual HTML code significantly, given the fact 
that current web pages have re-directions when clicking images. Moreover, the 
QR could have javascript code embedded, offering fancy image effects when in- 
teracting with the photos. Of course this technique will demand more processing 
from the browser, yet this cost may be overridden by the decrease of traffic load 
on central servers and routers. 



120 A. Zigomitros and C. Patsakis 

The proposed method can retrieve data after image cropping and distortion. 
QRs have already embedded in their structure error detecting and correcting 
codes that can be used to retrieve image contents if the distortion is not severe. 
In the case of image cropping, depending on what parts of the image have been 
left out. embedded data can still be retrieved, as not all of the embedded QRs 
will have been removed. 

By having access to image metadata, it is very easy to make cross site checks 
for digital rights infringement. In most cases the images have small distortion 
or they are saved on different image format. Using the proposed metadata em- 
bedding techniques, one could detect easier these cases and prove their true 
origin, yet it is obvious that the method alters any already embedded hidden 
watermark. 

The proposed method could be used in medical images as well, where meta- 
data is an essential need and the alteration of the images must be minimum. 
For applications of steganography and watermarking and in medical images the 
reader may refer to [S|. 

6 Conclusions 

Currently, the proposed method enables browsers to have access to the image 
metadata independent of the format, while enabling images to have extra code 
embedded. On one hand this compresses the data that are transmitted, while 
on the other hand it makes images "alive". 

A possible extension of the presented method would be to enable high defini- 
tion cameras on mobile device to be able to extract stored information of images, 
printed or not. The human eye can't read barcodes or QRs so there is no point 
of seeing it. Of couse the trade off would be the quality loss of the image because 
the noise that interferes between the image and the camera won't make it read- 
able by the device with the proposed method but a possibly solution to this is 
to altering bits of higher value or by applying certain filters over specific areas 
of an image. This would enable cameras to take photos of already content-aware 
objects and suppling the embedded information. 

This method easily can be extended to video files, where one could embed 
metadata to every frame of the video e.g. subtitles.

Abstract. The aim of this paper is to present an empirical study for defining the 
appropriate triggers for personality related stereotypes. These stereotypes are 
used for modelling the students in a Computer Supported Collaborative Learn- 
ing (CSCL) system for UML. The system builds individual student models to 
provide adaptive and intelligent advice concerning their knowledge and the 
most adequate colleagues for collaboration. Most of existing CSCL systems and 
Intelligent Learning Environments (ILE's) also include student models. How- 
ever, the vast majority of them use the student models to describe the students 
from the perspectives of knowledge and/or participation in collaborative activi- 
ties. In our approach, the student models additionally to the knowledge describe 
the students regarding specific personality characteristics related to their learn- 
ing and collaboration attitudes. The student models are built using the stereo- 
type-based method, which entails the definition of the stereotypes, their facets 
and the triggers (the triggering conditions for a student to belong to a stereo- 
type). As the definition of the triggers is a task of high importance for the effec- 
tiveness and accuracy of the student models, we conducted an empirical study 
among experienced trainers of software engineering.

1 Introduction 

The concept of collaborative learning, the grouping and pairing of students for the 
purpose of achieving an academic goal, has been widely researched and advocated 
throughout the professional literature (Gokhale 1995). Over the last ten years, coop- 
erative learning has become accepted as one of the "best practices" in education 
(Cohen et al. 2004). As computer technology developed, Computer-Supported Col- 
laborative Learning (CSCL) systems were established. CSCL systems are learning 
software environments that allow distant users to collaborate with each other promot- 
ing effective collaborative learning processes. Computer-supported collaborative 
learning (CSCL) is one of the most promising innovations to improve teaching and 
learning with the help of modern information and communication technology 
(Lehtinen et al. 1999).

In this paper, we present our work aiming to provide an effective CSCL environ- 
ment for teaching UML, which is called AUTO-COLLEAGUE (AUTOmated COL- 
LaborativE leArning Uml Environment). Trainees working in this environment can 
collaborate with each other as they learn UML. The system provides adaptive and in- 
telligent help to the trainees in order to facilitate collaborative learning. This help is 
adapted to the special needs and personality characteristics of each trainee. It concerns 
(a) indications on which help topics to study and (b) suggestions on the most appro- 
priate colleagues to collaborate with. 

Many effective Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) systems have 
been developed during the last decade, such as (Rosatelli and Self 2004), (Baghaei 
and Mitrovic 2005), (Chen et al. 2006), (Martinez Carreras et al. 2004), (Tamura and 
Furukawa 2008), (Khandaker et al. 2006), (Lukosch et al. 2006), (Rick and Guzdial 
2006), (Edwards et al. 2001). The main purpose of these systems is to allow remote 
users to collaborate with each other while working in the same environment at the 
same time. Some of them are platforms where users can share data in various formats 
(e.g. documents), but there is no advice mechanism and no common goal/problem to 
solve as a team. Not all of the systems offer advice to users. In the rest of the systems, 
the content of the advice is generated considering the level of expertise and the par- 
ticipation of the users in social activities (chat, whiteboard etc). AUTO- 
COLLEAGUE is, also, a CSCL system. Unlike the aforementioned CSCL systems, 
AUTO-COLLEAGUE offers adaptive advice to the trainees according not only to 
their state of knowledge but, also, to personality characteristics related to their learn- 
ing and collaboration processes. 

The essential functionality for every adaptive learning environment is to maintain 
individual student models. It has long been recognized that in order to build a good 
system in which a person and a machine cooperate to perform a task it is important to 
take into account some significant characteristics of people. These characteristics are 
used to build some kind of a "user model" (Rich 1983). Student modelling is a special 
type of user modelling which is relevant to the adaptivity of intelligent tutoring sys- 
tems (Elsom-Cook 1993). There are many methods for building user models, such as 
the stereotype theory, the overlay model (Virvou and Tsiriga 2001), the perturbation 
(or buggy) model (Faraco et al. 2004), fuzzy logic (Kavcic 2004), and Bayesian net- 
works (Reye 2004). 

In order to achieve adaptivity, AUTO-COLLEAGUE builds individual student 
models that describe the trainees regarding their level of expertise and personality. 
These student models are built following the stereotype-based theory proposed by 
Rich (1979). This theory simulates the way people make assumptions on others based 
on relevant information about them. Stereotypes constitute a very powerful technique 
in providing information based on few observations (Tsiriga and Virvou 2002). It has 
been used effectively in adaptive systems (Ardissono et al. 2004), (Goren-Bar 2001) 
to build user models and adapt their content according to the user profile. The stereo- 
type-based theory has, also, been widely used in intelligent learning environments in 
order to serve the educational and learning needs of the individual student (Jeremic et 
al. 2009), (Hatzilygeroudis and Prentzas 2004), (Kabassi et al. 2006), (Wei et al. 
2005), (Virvou and Moundridou 2001), (Surjono and Maltby 2003), (Tsiriga and Vir- 
vou 2002). The facets used in the stereotypes of these intelligent learning environ- 
ments are related to the errors, performance, knowledge and level of expertise of the

learners. Some of these systems include other characteristics such as interests, pre- 
ferred exercise types and multimedia type preference (Jeremic et al. 2009), careful- 
ness while solving exercises (Virvou and Moundridou 2001), (Tsiriga and Virvou 
2002) and concentration level (Hatzilygeroudis and Prentzas 2004). Especially, in 
(Surjono and Maltby 2003) specific learning styles are also included in the student 
model to be used (it has not yet been implemented, only analyzed). 

Similarly to the aforementioned intelligent learning environments, the stereotype- 
based student-modelling component of AUTO-COLLEAGUE includes characteristics 
related to the level of expertise of the students based on their performance during 
solving tests. The difference between them and our system concerns the nature of oth- 
er stereotypes used related to the personality of the students. As far as we have sur- 
veyed, there is no other system to include user models with personality characteris- 
tics, except for an approach to user modelling for recommender systems (Gonzalez et 
al. 2002). In this approach, values to specific personality characteristics are assigned 
to users after having them to answer to personality tests/questionnaires and are not 
evaluated in a computerized way during their stay in the system. The kind of the ste- 
reotypes used is the outcome of an empirical study among experienced trainers on the 
software engineering course and a study on learning styles based on the Five-Factor 
Model. Another substantial difference is the fact that in AUTO-COLLEAGUE the 
stereotypes of the students are evaluated in combination with those of their colleagues 
in order to suggest appropriate collaboration schemes. 

Modelling the student using the stereotype-based method means defining the 
stereotypes, the facets that describe these stereotypes and the triggers. Triggers are 
comprised of facet-value combinations. They denote the satisfying conditions for a 
student to belong or not belong to a stereotype. The purpose of this paper is to de- 
scribe how we defined the triggers used in our system, evaluating the results of a rela- 
tive empirical study among experienced trainers. 

2 Personality Related Stereotypes 

The level of expertise of the student is the most commonly used characteristic in- 
cluded in intelligent learning and CSCL environments that need to model the student. 
However, there are much more characteristics affecting the student during the learn- 
ing process. These are related to the way the student performs, behaves and thinks. 
The personality of the student affects these processes. Previous studies have shown 
how personality influences learning strategies and learning outcome (Heinstrom 
2000). Especially, in our case of creating optimum groups of learners, evaluating the 
personality of the individual students is crucial as it has a significant impact on the 
performance of the groups. Various studies have indicated that personality has an ef- 
fect on team effectiveness [...] (Gustavsson and Baccman 2005). The stereotypes we 
have included in our implementation are related to the level of expertise of the user, 
as well as the behaviour during the learning process. The stereotypes concern two as- 
pects of the trainee: the Level of Expertise and the Personality. 

The level of expertise stereotypes describe the knowledge level of the student on 
the domain, which is UML. There are four stereotypes in this category: Basics, Jun- 
ior, Senior and Expert. Each of these stereotypes represents a specific structure of 



126 K. Tourtoglou and M. Virvou 

knowledge and its degree. This degree is a real number that can get values between 
and 1, indicating the level of knowledge upon each UML concept. The stereotypes are 
associated with a subset of the expert's model. 

The personality stereotypes are related to the characteristics that influence the user 
behaviour regarding the way of learning and collaborating with others. There are 8 
Personality stereotypes: Self-confident, Diligent, Participative, Willing-to-help, Scep- 
tical, Hurried, Unconcentrated and Efficient. The self-confident user believes in 
him/herself and his/her skills. When a person has self-confidence, s/he maintains a 
positive attitude even if his/her knowledge and skills are not of a high level or even if 
probably s/he actually is not highly esteemed by his/her colleagues. The diligent user 
has earnest and persistent application to the training task and makes steady efforts 
during the learning process. The participative user seems to like collaborating with 
others and has an active presence in the task elaboration. The willing to help user de- 
monstrates good disposal to help his/her colleagues. Sceptical is the user that seems to 
need more than the average time to process the data of the problem. The sceptical user 
tends to make unreasonable mistakes and (relatively to his/her knowledge) the pro- 
gress in his/her skills could have been faster. The hurried user usually submits the an- 
swers to problems quickly without examining their correctness and effectiveness. This 
results to frequent errors. The unconcentrated user seems to lose his/her abstraction 
during the training task and perhaps is engaged with other irrelevant tasks at the same 
time. This kind of characteristic leads to frequent errors and increase in the average 
time needed to complete a task. The efficient user appears to successfully fulfill the 
demands of the training task. This kind of user always submits correct solu- 
tions/diagrams after a usual or even lower than the usual average amount of time. 

The facets (the attributes used to describe the stereotypes) used in AUTO- 
COLLEAGUE are: useless mouse movements and clicks frequency, average idle 
time, number of actions, error frequency, correct frequency, help utilization fre- 
quency, advice given frequency, help given to a member/non member of the group, 
help request from a member/non member of the group, communication frequency and 
number of upgrades/downgrades in level of expertise. 

3 Empirical Study for Defining the Triggers 

A system that is going to use stereotypes must also know about a set of triggers - 
those events whose occurrence signals the appropriateness of particular stereotypes 
(Rich 1979). A trigger is a set of rules/conditions. If these conditions are satis- 
fied/dissatisfied for a user, then the corresponding stereotype will be acti- 
vated/deactivated. These conditions examine the values of the facets used in the 
system. In order to define the triggers used in our system we conducted an empirical 
study with experienced trainers. 

We have chosen 22 experienced software engineering trainers to participate in the 
empirical study. The 9 of these trainers were project managers of 2 software houses 
that, among other duties, they train software engineers in the Borland Delphi pro- 
gramming language, the C# (in Microsoft Visual Studio) and MS SQL Server. There 
were, also, 8 teachers in the last grade of greek high schools that teach the software 
engineering course and the rest 5 trainers were scientific collaborators of the Univer- 
sity of Piraeus, experienced in training students in UML and programming languages.

127 



The aim of this empirical study was to decide which are the conditions of the facet 
values that would trigger each stereotype (concerning the stereotypes of Personality, 
not the Level of Expertise). Therefore, the trainers were asked to fill in a table with 
the combinations of facet values for every stereotype. For example, in table 1 the an- 
swers of a trainer for the Hurried stereotype are shown. Fl is the useless mouse 
movements and clicks frequency, F2 the average idle time, F3 the number of actions, 
F4 the error frequency, F5 the correct frequency, F6 the help utilization frequency, F7 
the advice given frequency, F8 the help given to a member of the group, F9 the help 
given to a non-member of the group, F10 the help request from a member of the 
group, Fl 1 the help request from a non-member of the group, F12 the communication 
frequency, F13 the number of upgrades in level of expertise and F14 the number of 
downgrades in level of expertise. In this way, she states that the conditions that should

be satisfied for a user to belong to this stereotype would be: the value of the useless 
mouse movements and clicks frequency is medium, the value of the average idle time 
is low, the value of the number of actions is high, the value of the error frequency is 
high, the value of the correct frequency is low and the value of the help utilization 
frequency is low. 

The results of this study were evaluated in two levels. At the first level we concluded 
to the facets we should include in the triggering conditions for each stereotype. We cal- 
culated the rates of the selected facets per stereotype and decided to include only those 
that had a percentage of selection over 15%. These results are shown in table 2. 

At the second level, we calculated the average values of the selected facets with a 
percentage over 15%. These results are shown in table 3 (L stands for low, M stands 
for medium and H stands for high) and constitute the final results of the evaluation of 
the empirical study. These are the conditions of facets values per stereotype that form 
the main triggers of the stereotypes.

4 Implementation of Triggers 



The Triggers in AUTO-COLLEAGUE are implemented in a Rule-Based subsystem 
(Ligeza 2006). We found it appropriate to use this technique as the triggering condi- 
tions do not constitute a large problem area and can be written in the if-then structure. 
Moreover, the rule-based technique meets our need to use a structure that could be 
easily updated even at runtime by the trainer of the system. 

The basic modules of a Rule-Based system are the rule-base, the working memory 
and the inference engine. The rule-base stores all the triggering conditions cited in table 



An Empirical Study for Integrating Personality Characteristics 129 

3 in if-then structure. The condition is written in the "If section and the stereotype to be 
triggered is written in the "then" section. The working memory is the student data de- 
rived from the system's database. This data concerns the student's facet values. The in- 
ference engine examines the facet values of the student at a specific moment and checks 
if these match with any of the conditions of the rules stored in the rule base. If it finds 
any matching rule, the inference engine fires/triggers the stereotype of the correspond- 
ing condition. The inference method used is forward chaining. This means that the in- 
ference engine will continue to search for matching conditions, taking into consideration 
the new data derived from previous triggered rules-stereotypes. 

The use of the forward chaining inference method was necessary for the Triggering 
subsystem. The main triggers are those derived from the empirical study explained in the 
previous section. However, there are other triggers too that do not concern only the facet 
values, but also the causality of the activation of another stereotype. For example, there are 
2 triggers for the Efficient stereotype. The first trigger is the one described in table 3 and 
related to facet values. The second trigger is related to the inference that a student may be- 
long to Efficient stereotype because s/he already belongs to the Expert stereotype. 

The triggers for the Level of Expertise stereotypes are implemented in the same sub- 
system in the same way. The only difference is the parameters of the condition sections. 
They do not include the facets discussed in the previous section, but the knowledge 
level on the domain that is derived from the level of expertise student model. 

5 Conclusion 

One of the most determinative factors in designing an effective adaptive and intelli- 
gent learning environment is building accurate student models that would describe the 
students in an extended range, as extended is the human nature. Therefore, our system 
is not limited to representing only the obvious aspects of the student, such as knowl- 
edge and participation in collaborative activities. In addition to them, the system in- 
fers personality characteristics that influence the students' behaviour during learning 
and collaboration. The stereotype-based student modelling method used for building 
the personality-related student models involves defining appropriate triggers for each 
of the defined stereotypes. Aiming at maximizing the accuracy and effectiveness of 
the extracted student models, we conducted an empirical study for defining these trig- 
gers. This empirical study is presented in this paper, along with some details on how 
the personality-related stereotypes were implemented.

Abstract. This paper presents a new VLSI architecture for fractional motion es- 
timation (FME) in H.264/AVC. Statistical characteristics of the motion vectors 
of different inter-prediction modes are analyzed. The FME architecture explored 
block-level parallelism and can process multiple blocks with the same predic- 
tion mode simultaneously, external memory data accesses are dramatically re- 
duced. Simulation results show that the proposed architecture can support 1080P 
(1960x1088) at 30fps with a frequency of 80MHz. 

1 Introduction 

As the newest international video coding standard, H.264/AVC, provides much better 
image quality and compression ratio, compared with previous standards. This mainly 
comes from many new techniques, such as variable block size motion estimation (VB- 
SME), pixel fractional motion estimation, multiple reference frame (MRF), in-the-loop 
deblocking filter and so on. 

However, the intensive computation of H.264/AVC is the major obstacle for real- 
time encoding systems, especially consider that H.264/AVC requires almost 10 times 
the computation of previous coding standards. In H.264/AVC hardware encoder] 1 1, the 
ME consists of 2 stages, the integer motion estimation (IME) for 7 block modes, and 
fractional motion estimation (FME) with 1/2 and 1/4 pixel accuracy. 

In the IME stage, all the 7 block modes are processed in parallel with the SAD- 
reusing technique, and the integer motion vectors (IMV) of the 41 sub-blocks are then 
transferred to FME. In the FME stage, because these 41 sub-blocks have different 
IMVs, all the sub-blocks should be separately processed. Moreover, because 4x4 block 
size is the smallest unit for all the block modes, usually, a 4x4 based PU is adopted 
and all bigger blocks were divided into 4x4 to fully utilize the hardware, e.g. see 0j]. 
Then the FME compuatation is in direct proportion to the number of block modes. For 
H.264/AVC with 7 block modes and a single reference frame, there are 7x16 =112 
4x4 blocks. Lack of block level parallelism, blocks like 16x8, 8x16, 8x8, etc, have to 
be processed sequentially, e.g. |2), 2) and 10. To overcome this difficulty, some fast 
algorithms are brought forward, e.g. [3], bilinear filters are used to replace 6-tap FIR 
filters, and only single-iteration FME is needed. However, this inevitablly introduced 
prediction error propagation. Considering other factors, like irregular memory access- 
ing, obtaining FME from IME becomes the bottleneck for the whole encoding system.

In order to improve the FME processing speed and keep the same encoding perfor- 
mance, in this paper, we explored block-level parallelism and a hardware architecture 
for parallel processing of two blocks (equal or greater than 8x8) is proposed. Also, by 
adopting a shifting register array, intensive access to reference memory is significantly 
alleviated. 



2 H.264/AVC FME Observations 

2.1 Encoding with INTER8x8 Mode or above 

Our experiments show that for natural images, modes above 8x8 dominate the final 
MB modes. Moreover, experiments have shown that the image quality even has slightly 
better without the small block modes. FigQ] shows a case with high motion intensities 
and complex content details. Similar observations can also be found in [2|. Therefore, 
in our realized FME engine, the block modes below 8x8 are all removed, which saves 
about 40% of the compuatational complexity.

2.2 Statistic Charactistics of Motion Vectors 

For FME, the fact that different blocks may have different IMVs prevents the encoder 
from parallel processing. The relative position of neighboring blocks is not fixed, which 
adds difficulties to multi-FME engines data fetching. 

However, natural images are likely to have high correlations among neighboring 
motion vectors (MV). Figj2]is one of our experiment results. Delta MVs are the absolute 
difference values between the motion vectors of neighboring blocks. Eqs (1) and (2) 
are the formula for calculating delta MVs for mode 16x8 and mode 8x16. Delta MVs 
for mode 8x8 is more complicated. For that mode, neighboring blocks include both 
horizontal and vertical neighbors. With the reference codec, JM16, we did experiments

3 The Proposed Architecture 



For H.264/AVC FME design, three important issues need to be considered. The first is 
the data fetching, accesses to external memories need to be minimized. The second is 
the local memory size for FME, it should be minimized because abour 80% of the chip 
area is occupied by on-chip memories in an ASIC. The third is the data sharing and 
parallelism, which determines the FME processing speed and system frequency. The 
proposed architecture improves on all three issues over prior art designs. 

Fig[3] shows our proposed FME system architecture. It consists of a control FSM, a 
reference pixel array, a sampler line mux, a current MB pixel array, two FME engines 
for interpolation and cost calculation, a unit for comparator and output buffer for motion 
compensation (MC). The FME Control FSM gets optimal IMVs and current Ref- Array 
locations from the IME engine, it controls the shifting directions of both the Ref- Array 
and the Cur-MB Array, also the cooperation of all the internal FME sub-modules de- 
scribed below.

3.1 Reference Pixel Array 

In our design, a 32x32 pixels array is used for the reference window. This array was used 
by IME before it goes to FME. Two such arrays are used to enable parallel ping-pong 
processing between IME and FME. 

As shown in Fig|4] the reference array can shift in both horizontal and vertical direc- 
tions. Each cell consists of an 8-bit flip-flop and a 4-to-l mux. The mux is programmed 
by the FME control FSM, determining the shifting direction of the reference array. 

This reference array is fetched by the IME engine and is handed over to FME engine 
once IME is done. So, the reference data is only loaded once and used by both IME and 
FME. This reduces intensive memory access and irregular memory addressing issues. 



3.2 Integer Pixel Sampler in Reference Array 

In the reference array, we have a horizontal and a vertical sampler lines, both with 26 
samplers. The positions of these two sampler lines are fixed in the array. Only pixels in 
these lines can be sampled and used for FME. 

At any time, only one of these two sampler lines is active. That is, when the array 
is shifting horizontally, the vertical sampler line will be used; and when the array is 
shifting vertically, the horizontal sampler line will be used. 

As shown in FigfSJ 2-to-l muxs are used to select either the horizontal sampler line

3.3 14-Input FME Engine 

The two 14-Input (Ref -pixels) FME Engine working in parallel are the key parts of the 
proposed architecture. As show in Fig[6j these colored input units are from the mux 
outputs in Fig [5] 

The FME engines make use of the statistical characteristics of IMVs which we dis- 
cussed above. 14 8-to-l muxs are adopted for the inputs of the second FME engine. 
So, the delta IMVs between neighboring blocks do not have to be zero, they can be any 
values from to 4, which counts more than 90% of the cases. For INTER8x8 mode, the 
situation is a little bit more complicated, but we still can benefit form this architecture. 

Inside every FME engine, an interpolation engine shown as Fig|7]is used. It takes 
14 integer reference pixels as inputs, and in every clock cycle, it will produce 8 half- 
pels around every selected 8 integer pixels pointed by IMVs, or 8 quarter-pels around 
selected 8 half-pels pointed by half-pel motion vectors (bilinear filters were not drawn 
in Fig|7]l. 

Once we picked a sampler line, the input pixels to FME engine are always from the 
fixed locations (pixeLO to pixel_13). On the other side, we used 14 8-to-l muxs for FME

engine l to select input pixels from 21 locations. The usage of muxs is to accommodate 
the different motion vectors among neighboring blocks. 

Briefly, the tasks for these 2 FME engines include: half-pel interpolation and motion 
search among 8 half-pel positions, quarter-pel interpolation and motion search among 
8 quarter-pel positions, dump reference pixels (integer-pel, half-pel or quarter-pel) to 
MC stage. It will output SATD values and corresponding motion vectors for different 
prediction modes, from INTER 16x1 6 to INTER8x8. 



3.4 Data Processing Order 

The FME will always start from INTER8x8 mode, since it can be processed either 
horizontally or vertically. As shown in FigJH] and Fig|9j there are two data processing 
orders. Depending on the MV distribution of 4 blocks in INTRA8x8 mode, FME control 
unit will compute which direction will consume less processing cycles before the Ref- 
Array shifting starts. 

In Fig[8]and Fig|9] the blue bars stand for the active sampler lines. Once the FME 
control FSM decides to shift 4 INTER8x8 reference blocks left, the data processing 
order will be like Fig0 followed by INTER16x8 mode, INTER8xl6 mode and IN- 
TER16xl6 mode. If the FME control FSM decides to shift 4 INTER8x8 refrence blockd 
down, the data flow will be like FigH followed by INTER8xl6 mode, INTER16x8 
mode and INTER 16x1 6 mode. 

In the best case, FME engine and FME engine 1 can work simutaneously. It can 
process blockO and block 1 in INTER 16x8 mode, INTER8xl6 mode, two half parts in

allel processing has to satisfy certain conditions. For INTER8xl6 mode, Eq.(3) should 
be satisfied and for INTER16x8 mode, Eq. (4) should be satisfied, where MUX_DIST is 
4 in our experiments. INTER8x8 mode has a much more complicated algorithm, which 
will not be discussed in here.

In the equations above, blkijnv-x/y refers to the motion vectors for blocks MUX_DIST 
refers to the maximal differences of motion vectors between neighboring blocks. 



140 Z. Zhao and P. Liang 

If the current processing mode does not meet the parallel processing requirement, a 
miss penalty will be applied. For example, if INTER8xl6 mode does not satisfy Eq.(3), 
then after it finishes FME of block in engine 0, it has to scan back for block 1 and 
shifts it to the desired position for FME processing in engine 1. In this scenario, a certain 
number of bubble cycles are generated. 



3.5 3-Stages Processing 

The interpolation structure in Fig|7]can generate both half-pels and quarter-pels for 
FME. However, if we do both of them in a single iteration, a lot of memory cells will 
be used to store these sub-pels. In order to save expensive on-chip memory space, a 
hierarchical processing flow consisting of 3 stages is adopted in our design. 

In the first stage, half-pel FME will be conducted as stated in section D. The best half- 
pel MVs (HMV) will be generated. In the second stage, quarter-pel FME is conducted 
and the best quarter-pel MVs (QMV) and the best INTER mode is generated. In the 
third stage, the reference pixels based on best mode and best QMV is output to MC 
buffer. 



4 Simulation Results 

The proposed FME architecture and data processing order have been simulated in a 
SystemC implementation. Test videos with different content details and motion intensi- 
ties have been tested. In most of the experimental results, the average FME processing 
periods are around 200 clock cycles as Table[l]shows. FigfT0]shows the possibility dis- 
tributions of number of processing cycles per MB for several video sequencies with 
different motion intensity and content details. Our simulation also shows that for al- 
most all the test videos in [6] (up to 1080P 30fps), a clock frequency of 80MHz will be 
sufficient.

5 Conclusions 

In this paper, we proposed a new simplified FME architecture with a shifting reference 
array, which explores block-level parallelism for processing of multiple blocks with 
different IMVs simultaneously. With this architecture, FME processing throughput in a 
large number of practical applications was dramatically improved and intensive mem- 
ory accesses were avoided. Simulation shows an 80MHz processing frequency for most 
video contents up to 1080P 30fps.

Abstract. Global motion estimation (GME) is an important technique in image 
and video processing. Whereas the direct global motion estimation techniques 
boast reasonable precision they tend to suffer from high computational com- 
plexity. As with indirect methods, though presenting lower computational com- 
plexity they mostly exhibit lower accuracy than their direct counterparts. In this 
paper, the authors introduce a robust algorithm for GME with near identical ac- 
curacy and almost 50-times faster than MPEG-4 verification model (VM). This 
approach entails two stages in which, first, motion vector of sampled block is 
employed to obtain initial GME then Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is applied 
to the sub-sampled pixels to optimize the initial GME values. As will be shown, 
the proposed solution exhibits remarkable accuracy and speed features with 
simulation results distinctively bearing them out. 



1 Introduction 

Motion estimation and compensation is one of the most essential techniques in video 
compression and processing. Motions in video are categorized into local motion (LM) 
and global motion (GM) [1]. The LMs are resulted from movement, rotation and re- 
form of objects, while the GMs are due to movement, rotation, and camera zoom [2]. 
Global motion estimation (GME) has many applications such as video coding, image 
stabilization, video object segmentation, virtual reality and etc. In MPEG-4 standard, 
some techniques such as sprite coding and global motion compensation (GMC) are 
required for GME [3]. 

The common GME methods are divided into direct and indirect categories. In the 
direct category, which is pixel-based, prediction error is minimized by using optimi- 
zation methods such as Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) [l],[2],[4]-[7]. The 
indirect methods consist of two stages. In the first stage, motion vectors of blocks are 
calculated and by using these vectors, GM of frame is estimated in the second stage 
[8]-[14]. 

In MPEG-4 verification model (VM), GME is a direct type scheme where LMA is ap- 
plied to the whole frame. Since LMA has high computational complexity, some methods 
have been devised by considering a limited number of pixels in the calculations. One such

technique is called FFRGMET that is used in MPEG-4 optimizing model. This technique 
just applies LMA to a number of pixels called feature pixels [15]. In [6], pixels are se- 
lected using gradient method. In this work, each frame is divided into 100 blocks and then 
10% of pixels with the highest gradient are selected from each block. This procedure re- 
quires gradient calculations and pixels arrangement based on the gradients. Therefore, this 
method has a considerable computational complexity. The idea of random pixels selection 
is introduced in [16]. In spite of the method presented in [6], this technique has much 
lower computational complexity. However, random pixel selection causes numerical in- 
stabilities. In [4] and [5], pixels are selected based on a static pattern. In these papers, au- 
thors divide the frame into non-overlapped blocks and then select a few pixels with static 
pattern from each block. This method has low computational complexity and also does not 
cause numerical instabilities. In comparison to MPEG-4 VM, this scheme is faster with lit- 
tle accuracy degradation. An indirect GME for the affine model is proposed in [14]. In this 
study, firstly the amount of translation is estimated by using integral projection algorithm 
(IP A) and then based on that information a limited block-matching is performed for each 
sampled block. 

In this paper, we have improved the proposed method in [14] and intend to use the 
perspective model. This is expected to achieve an improvement of peak signal to 
noise ratio (PSNR) at low complexity. 

The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. The motion models are de- 
scribed in section 2 and in section 3, the proposed method including its different steps 
are discussed in details. The simulation studies are provided in section 4 and finally 
the paper is concluded in section 5. 

2 Motion Models 

The most comprehensive GM model in MPEG-4 is the perspective model. This model 
encompasses simpler models. This model is defined by:

m 1 x l +m ii y i +1 



-\m x m 2 â â â  m s ] (3) 



where m is GM vector from current frame pixels (x, , v,) to reference frame pixels {x\ , 
y'i). This vector consists of translation parameters (m 3 and m 6 ), rotation and zoom pa- 
rameters (mi, m 2 , m 4 , and m 5 ), and perspective parameters (m 1 and m 8 ). Simpler mod- 
els such as affine (with 6 parameters, m 7 = m g =0), Translation-Zoom-Rotation (with 4 
parameters, m^m.5, m 2 =-m A , m 7 =m^=0), Translation-Zoom (with 3 parameters, mi=ms, 
m 2 =m 4 =m7=m 8 =0) and Translation (with 2 parameters, mi=ms=\, m2=m 4 =m 1 =m i =Q) 
are special cases of perspective model.

3 Global Motion Estimation 

The proposed algorithm consists of two stages. The first process calls for a rough es- 
timation of GM. When this is obtained second stage takes place in which the initial 
estimation has to be optimized with greater precision. Structure of the proposed algo- 
rithm is as follows. 

Stage I 

â¢ Estimating translation between two frames using IPA. 

â¢ Sampling blocks from the current frame as in Fig. 1 . Calculating motion vectors of 
sampled blocks using block matching (with shifted search centre and small search- 
ing range). Excluding 30% of blocks with maximum sum of absolute differences 
(SAD). 

â¢ Estimating eight parameters of GM vector using above motion vectors. 

Stage II 

â¢ Sampling current frame pixels using 1:12x12 model as in Fig.2-d. Applying LMA 
to sampled pixels to optimize initially estimated GM of the first stage. The LMA 
iterations are continued until either of the following conditions is satisfied: reach- 
ing 10 iterations or updated term be lower than 0.001 for translational components 
and lower than 0.00001 for other components. 

3.1 Initial Translation Estimation 

In the first stage of GME, translation components must be estimated. In [l]-[5], a 
three-step search is used for this purpose. IPA is employed instead of a three-step 
search in our algorithm, because it is more accurate and robust [14]. 

To estimate translation between two frames, horizontal and vertical projection vec- 
tors are calculated as: 

1 M 

lP k horiz {y) = âY J F k {x,y) (4) 

M x=l 



IPr(x) = ^-Y J F k {x,y) (5) 

where F k denotes luminance of frame k and (M , AO are dimensions of frames. 
IP k and IP k are integral projection values of F k in vertical and horizontal direc- 
tions respectively. By using the correlation between horizontal and vertical integral 
projection vectors of F k and F k .j, a translation value is calculated in vertical and in 
horizontal directions as below: 

d x = min jJT(/p;- (*)-//>;-(* -O) 2 } (6)

where (d x ,dy) is translation of the current frame with respect to previous frame and s 
is maximum search range. The maximum search range is determined based on the 
size and contents of the video. To give some examples, sâ% for QCIF format and 
s=16 for CIF and SIF formats seems reasonable.

3.2 Block Sampling and Limited Block Matching 

After translation estimation, one of the patterns in Fig. 1 is employed for blocks sam- 
pling. Size of each block for different formats is considered as: 8x8 for QCIF, 16x16 
for CIF and SIF and 32x32 for 4CIF. Then for each sampled block, a modified full 
search block matching algorithm (BMA) is obtained. In this search, the search centre 
is shifted (d x ,dy) units and searching range is as small as (-3, +3). This results in less 
SAD computations and sufficient accuracy for motion vectors of background blocks. 
Since blocks with high SAD are mostly part of the foreground, 30% of them are ex- 
cluded. The motion vectors of remaining blocks will be used in the next subsection. 

3.3 Initial Estimation of Perspective Model GM Parameters 

By considering (x, , v,) as central pixel coordinate of the current frame sampled block 
and (xi , v,' ) as central pixel coordinate of the best matched block, we can have: 



zv x ,i+ x i 



(8) 



v . =v â  + V â  

J l y ,i J i 



(9) 



where V c â  and V â  are motion vectors obtained from the previous step. 
To find GM between two frames, we must minimize the Euclidean error:

m 1 x i +m & y . +1

whrere N/, is number of blocks. Since the perspective model is nonlinear, (10) could 
be solved by using LMA which results in significant computational complexity. On 
the other hand, by using algebraic error definition [17], (10) can be modified as:

N^

where Z), is the denominator of motion model: 

D ={m 7 x. +m s y. +l) 
Therefore, we can simplify (11) as: 

N " r 

E =Y) [ (m l x i +m 2 y. +m 3 -x'D. f +(m 4 x i +m 5 y . +m 6 -y'D.) 2 

At this stage, we can minimize (1 1) by solving A. â and arriving at:

\i=\ ) i=\ 
where m is GM vector. The A, matrix and b, vector are defined as:

3.4 Subsampling Pixels and Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm 

In this stage, the estimated GM from the previous stage is optimized with greater ac- 
curacy by employing LMA. In this paper, we suggest subsampling from all pixels of 
current frame with a static pattern as in [4], instead of just selecting feature pixels

among the remaining blocks as in [14]. This selection technique poses less computa- 
tional complexity than [14] and it is more precise. 

In this paper, the 1:12x12 sampling method is used which means that we select one 
pixel from each 12x12 block. After pixels subsampling, initial GM is optimized by 
applying LMA to these pixels. To reduce outlier effects, 10% of pixels with the most 
error are discarded after first iteration [4]. 



4 Simulation 



In this section, the proposed method is examined and compared against MPEG-4 VM, 
[14] and [4] with a sampling factor l:9x9.The following sequences with CIF format 
are considered for simulations: Akiyo (300 frames), Bus (150 frames), Carphone (300 
frames), Coastguard (300 frames), Foreman (400 frames), Flower (150 frames), Mo- 
bile (300 frames), Stefan (300 frames), Tempete (260 frames), and Waterfall (260 
frames). The simulations are run on a desktop computer featuring 2.66GHz 
Core2Quad CPU, 4GB RAM and MS Windows Vista operating system in MATLAB 
environment. 

The GME time of different sequences are presented in Table 1 . Judging from the 
Table, it is seen that the proposed method's GME time is less than that in [4] for most 
of the sequences. Furthermore, this is almost the same as the GME time in [14] with 
affine model. 

Table 2 compares speed of the proposed method versus other methods in relation 
to the MPEG-4 VM method with perspective model. As these results illustrate, the 
proposed technique is 53 times faster than VM with perspective model. This is while 
the method in [14] is about 43 times faster than VM with affine model and about 60 
times faster than VM with perspective model. The Proposed method as well as [4] 
both work with perspective model whereas [14] only works with affine model.

In Table 3, PSNR of GME for each sequence is presented. Table 4 also displays 
PSNR degradation in respect of VM with perspective motion model. As the results 
demonstrate, the proposed method has on average reduced the PSNR by -0.2 dB while 
[14] method degrades the PSNR by -1.2 dB. 

5 Conclusion 



In this paper a fast two-stage algorithm for global motion estimation (GME) with per- 
spective model is introduced. In the first stage, eight parameters of global motion 
(GM) are estimated by using sampled motion vectors of blocks. In the second stage, 
by subsampling of pixels and using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA), the es- 
timated GM of the first stage is estimated more accurately. 

As the simulation results demonstrate, one key advantage of the proposed solution 
in this paper is that it is almost 53 times faster than the MPEG-4 VM method. Another 
outstanding feature of the innovative technique is its enhanced estimation accuracy 
which is more than FFRGMET's and [4]'s and almost the same as MPEG-4 VM's. 
Still, when compared against [14], the algorithm exhibits better precision under the 
same speed. This is while our method works with the perspective model and [14] es- 
timates the simpler affine model.

Abstract. The paper describes a system for automatically generating 
comics from visit log at a metaverse museum. Metaverse is a 3D virtual 
world in which users can act freely, such as visiting museums or chatting 
with others, according to their own purposes. Compared with existing 
approaches for representing user experiences using snapshots or video 
clips, the comic approach can 1) allow users to grasp the whole story at 
a glance, 2) facilitate distinguishing of important frames, and 3) exploit 
varieties of comic writing techniques. In order to summarize user experi- 
ence into comic's frames, detection of important experience, interesting 
exhibits in case of the museums, is an important task. In this paper, 
we propose a method for frame extraction based on the displacement 
amount of a user of interest at a metaverse museum. After describing 
each module of our system, we discuss a user evaluation in which the 
effectiveness of the proposed frame extraction method is confirmed when 
it is compared with a typical baseline method. 



1 Introduction 

Virtual 3D space called metaverse has recently gained interests from not only 
educators but also researchers as a promising educational and research platform. 
Second Life (SL) is representative metaverse equipped with a function that en- 
ables its users to build objects or architectures. Unlike online games, metaverse, 
in general, has no specific roles assigned to the users. As a result, user experi- 
ences are arguably limitless including, for example, visiting to museums built by 
other users or chatting to other users. Other usages of metaverse include an ex- 
periment (Prendinger 2009) that aims at realization of an eco-friendly society as 
well as Machinima (Lowood 2006) that uses in-game avatars (user characters), 
objects, and architectures for filming. 

A number of metaverse systems have functions that allow users to take snap- 
shots of their experiences or record them into video clips. Such snapshots or 
video clips are used by the users to recall their memories or shown to other users 
via, for example, blogs or SNS sites. However, manually taking a snapshot each 
time imposes a burden to the user. And video clips require considerable time

to grasp the story and distinguish between important and unimportant events 
therein. In order to cope with these issues, we focus on the use of comics for 
representing user experiences. 

Using the comic style, one can summarize a given user experience into a 
limited number of frames, provided that a proper summarization mechanism is 
used. Hence a whole story can be apprehended at one glance. In addition, a 
frame layout technique can be applied to emphasize important frames and un- 
deremphasize unimportant ones. In this paper, we focus on museum visiting, one 
of the major usages in metaverse, present a system for generating a comic based 
on the museum visiting experience of a user of interest, and propose a frame 
extraction method that uses the information on the amount of displacement at 
a museum of interest. 

2 Comic Generation System 

We have developed a comic generating system and related methods (Shuda and 
Thawonmas 2008; Thawonmas and Shuda 2008; Thawonmas and Oda 2010) for 
on-line games. Our objectives therein are to summarize players' game experiences 
into comics so that the players can exchange their comics with others and recall 
their memories about the game. However, an online game, the research target in 
our previous work, is essentially different from metaverse, which is the research 
target of this paper. 

In a typical online game, players' actions, such as "attack a monster" or "open 
a treasure" are prepared and provided in advance by the game developer. Such 
actions are meaningful, can be interpreted as important episodes, and are thus 
worth memorizing. However, most of the actions in metaverse, such as "move" 
or "sit" have not much meaning. It is therefore difficult to extract important 
episodes from log. As far as the museum visit application is concerned, one 
might come up with a method for extracting comic frames that cover important 
exhibits specified in advance by the museum's developers. However, this method 
lacks the universality because it cannot be used at other museums where such 
information is not available. In addition, the method does not take into account 
the preference of a user of interest. 

According to a study on a real- world museum (Sparacino 2003), the more 
interest a user has in a given exhibit, the higher probability is that he or she 
will spend longer time viewing the exhibit. Based on this finding, we propose 
a frame extraction method that bases on the displacement amount (cf. (1)) to 
predict the user's interest at a given virtual museum. Namely, the displacement 
amount of zero implies that the user is stopping at a particular place viewing an 
exhibit, and the longer stop period, the more interest the user has in the exhibit. 
The proposed frame extraction method puts higher priorities to such stops. 

Figure [T] shows the architecture of the comic generation system, where "visit 
log" indicates a file that contains information on the user traces (the coordinate 
(x, y, z) at each loop-count, the number of times in sampling the coordinate), 
the user actions, and the object positions in the museum. In the following, we 
describe each of the four modules shown in Fig. Q]

1. At this module, the amount of displacement for a given user trace at each 
loop-count I is calculated as follows: 

displacement 2 = (x(l) -x(l- 1)) 2 + (y(l) -y(l- 1)) 2 + (z(l) -z{l-l)f (1) 

Next, the given user trace are segmented into stop segments or move seg- 
ments. The stop segments are those whose displacement amount is zero while 
the remaining segments become the move segments. For segment n, the fol- 
lowing pieces of information are stored in Segment(n), i.e., state, length, 
start, end, sumDisplacement, and count, indicating the type of this segment 
(stop or move), the length of this segment in terms of the number of loop- 
counts, the starting loop-count, the ending loop-count, the total amount of 
displacement, and the number of frames extracted from this segment, re- 
spectively. In addition, for each stop-type segment, the information on the 
stop position, stopPosition, is also stored. 

2. At the frame extraction step, the following two conditions are applied to all 
stop-type segments for extraction of them: 

Condition I: Is its stopPosition not adjacent to stopPosition of the previ- 
ously extracted stop-type segment? 

Condition II: Is its length above the average length of all stop-type 
segments? 

The former condition is employed to prevent extraction of frames showing 
similar user experiences, such as frames showing the user stopping to view 
the same exhibit. The latter condition is employed to prevent extraction of 
frames showing spontaneous stops by the user. 

For each stop-type segment n satisfying both conditions, its count is in- 
cremented and a frame, Frame(/), is added into a frame-candidate list, by 
which the content of Segment(n) is copied to FramcInfo(/), containing the 
information about Frame(/), where / represents the frame number. If the 
number of extracted frames is more than the number of frames specified 
by the user, frames in the frame-candidate list will be removed in increasing 
order of FrameInfo(/) .length until the specified number of frames, N, is met. 

Frame extraction is done for move-type segments only when the number 
of stop-type frames extracted above is lower than N. In this case, this is done 
for the move- type segments in decreasing order of sumDisplacement. Namely, 



156 R. Thawonmas and A. Fukumoto 

first, a frame, Framc(/), is extracted from the move-type segment with the 
highest sumDisplaccment and added to the frame-candidate list, by which 
after incrementing count Segment(n) is copied to FramcInfo(/); then the one 
with the second highest sumDisplacement; and so on. For example, if N is 
10, and there exist 7 stop-type segments and 5 move-type segments, then, 
after extraction of 7 frames from the stop-type segments, 3 frames will be 
extracted from the move- type segments with the top-three sumDisplacement. 

If frame extraction has been done for all move-type segments, but the 
total number of extracted frames is still lower than N, then another round 
of frame extraction will be done for the move-type segments. This process 
is repeated until N is filled. Due to such repetitions, multiple frames might 
be extracted from a same move-type segment; however, such frames have 
different snapshot timings as discussed below. 

Once N is met, the frame-candidate list will be copied to a frame list, 
at which the snapshot timing Â£(/) is determined for being used later in the 
rcndcrer module. For a stop-type frame, Frame(/), the snapshot timing is 
as follows: 

Â£(/) = Framclnfo(/). start + 0. 5Fi&mcInio( f). length (2) 

Although any timing in [FrameInfo(/). start, FrameInfo(/). end] should pro- 
duce the similar (not same because the user avatar's face or hands might 
move) comic frame, we empirically decided to use the above formula. 
For a move- type frame, Frame(/), the snapshot timing is as follows: 

*(/) = FrameInfo (/ ). S ^ + FrameInfo(/).len^ 

rr&mcmio(j ) .count + 1 

3. At the frame layout module, each frame in the frame list is assigned a page 
and the position therein. This decision is based on the information on N, 
the page margins, and the number of frames per row and column. 

4. At the renderer module, the system scans the visit log from the beginning 
and renders the snapshot image of the user experience with the snapshot 
timing t(f) of each frame in the frame list. Each rendered image is then 
placed on the specific position in the predetermined comic page according to 
the information stored in the corresponding frame. Finally, all comic pages 
are outputted as an image file. 



3 Evaluation 

After implementing the proposed system, we conducted a user evaluation. The 
objective of this user evaluation is to examine if the proposed system can generate 
a comic that properly summarizes the user experience viewing exhibits at a 
metavcrsc museum.

3.1 Implementation 



We implemented the system by adding the above four modules to the open- 
source SL client program (SL viewer program). For this work, we adopted a 
typical comic layout where the order to read is in the raster order, from top-left 
to bottom- right, and all frames have the same size. 

For the evaluation, we targeted user experiences at a SL museuiqj designed 
and operated by members of Global COE (Center of Exellence) Progam gDigital 
Humanities Center for Japanese Arts and Culturch of Ritsumeikan Unviersity. 
This museum is aimed at a virtual exhibition of Kaga Okunizome Dyeing, kimono 
and bedding from the Ishikawa region in Japan during the latter part of the Edo 
period until the beginning of the Showa period. However, we would like to point 
out that our system is also applicable to other museums in SL as well as other 
metaverse. 

Figure [5] shows the museum building in which 19 exhibits and two posters 
are located. Our reasons for extracting this museum are that (1) the exhibition 
therein has a high cultural value because Kaga Okunizome dyeing is famous in 
Japan and (2) there is no copyright problem because the authors belong also 
to the aforementioned Global COE. For other representative museums in SL, 
please refer to the work by Urban et al. (Urban et al. 2007).

3.2 Evaluation Outline 



We compared comics whose frames were extracted by the proposed frame- 
extraction method and a baseline frame-extraction method. Each method was 
implemented in our comic-generation system. The latter method uses a fixed- 
and-equal interval for extraction of frames in a given comic. We first requested 
26 participants, who are undergraduate or graduate students in our department, 
to watch each of the three video clips, showing typical visits of each of the three 
visitor types (Sparacino 2003): busjQ, selectivqj, and greedjQ. After watching a 
video clip, each participant was asked to compare two comics of the same num- 
ber of frames that were extracted by the two methods from the corresponding 
visit log used for the video clip, without being told which method was used for 
a given comic. In particular, each participant was asked to answer the following 
four questions for each comic in the typical five-level Likert scale: 

Ql Does the comic have the content well representing the video-clip play? 
Q2 Docs the comic have the minimum amount of unnecessary frames? 
Q3 Does the comic well display exhibits? 
Q4 Does the comic have a dynamic story? 

The participants were also asked to write a short reason behind their rating for 
each question. 

3.3 Results and Discussions 

Tables 1, 2, and 3 show the average score of each method for the busy-type, the 
selective-type, and the greedy-type, respectively. The proposed method outper- 
forms the baseline in all questions, except Q3. Q3 is related to the quality of the 
camerawork and the relating parameters. Hence, the camerawork of the comic 
generation system should be improved. 

Figure [3] shows the first page of the selective-type comics whose frames were 
extracted by the proposed method and the baseline method. It can be seen that 
the latter method extracted a number of similar frames while the former method 
did not. Similar comments were obtained from participants as their reasons for 
rating the former method higher than the latter one. 

4 Related Work 

A storytelling system was implemented that generates slides from images taken 
at multiple locations on a given map (Fujita feamp; Arikawa 2008). For segmen- 
tation of videos, a method (Xu et al. 2009) exists that uses histograms of human 
motions, but this method aims at fast movements such as sports or dances, not 
slow movements typically seen in SL avatars while they are visiting museums.

A scripting system (Zhang et al. 2007.) was proposed for automating cinemat- 
ics and cut-screens that facilitate video-game production processes such as the 
control of transitions between images, and the annotation of texts and sounds 
to image backgrounds. 

There is a number of existing work in addition to the authors' previous work 
(Shuda feamp; Thawonmas 2008; Thawonmas & Shuda 2008; Thawonmas 
and Oda 2010) on comic generation for online games. Such work includes comic 
generation for online games using a combination of screenshots (Chan et al. 
2009), rather than using the targeted game's engine for re-rendering frames as 
done in our approach, and for first person shooters (Shamir et al. 2006). Comics 
were also used for summarization of experiences in a conference (Sumi et al. 
2002), daily experiences (Cho et al. 2007), and videos or movies (Calic et al. 
2007; Hwang et al. 2006; Tobita 2010). 

5 Conclusions and Future Work 

We proposed and implemented a system for generating comics from user experi- 
ences during their museum visits. The system enables extraction of frames that 
contain interesting exhibits, from the view point of a user of interest. This was

achieved by taking into account the amount of displacement in the museum space 
and giving higher priorities to stop-type segments having long stop time. The 
user evaluation confirmed the effectiveness, in properly representing the afore- 
mentioned user experiences, of the proposed system for all visitor types. As our 
future work, we plan to increase the expressivity of comics. One possible research 
theme is to strengthen the comic layout mechanism. This would increase the va- 
riety of comic frames, such as large frames, small frames, slanted frames, etc. 
As already stated in 3.3, another theme is to improve the camerawork so that a 
more proper set of camera parameters, i.e., the camera angle, camera position, 
and zoom position, is applied to a given frame. The mechanisms proposed in our 
previous work for online games (Thawonmas and Shuda 2008; Thawonmas and 
Ko 2010) will be extended, respectively, for these two research themes.

Abstract. This paper describes the development of a knowledge-based 
authoring tool, which aims to be useful to teachers and students in multiple 
language learning. The tool provides assistance on the editing of exercises and 
also on the creating, updating or erasing a student's profile by the teacher. The 
system monitors the students while they are answering the exercises and 
provides appropriate feedback. One of the system's basic functions in to create 
a student model, which promotes the educational process. The tool incorporates 
an error diagnosis component, which handles the students' errors in the three 
languages. Multilingual support in Computer Assisted Language Learning 
(CALL) is a significant innovation in the related scientific literature. 

Keywords: Knowledge-based authoring tool, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, 
Student Modeling, Error Diagnosis, Multiple Language Learning. 



1 Introduction 

In the European Union (EU), there are twenty-three official languages along with a 
wide range of others (www.europa.eu). The EU encourages all its citizens to become 
multilingual. More specifically, it encourages them to be able to speak two languages 
in addition to their mother tongue. Even though the EU has very limited influence in 
this area of educational systems, it offers a number of EU funding programs which 
actively promote language learning and linguistic diversity (www.europa.eu). 
Language learning has proved to be more effective with the use of Intelligent 
Tutoring Systems (ITSs), also called knowledge based tutors. ITSs, which have 
gained ground the last decades, are computer-based instructional systems that direct 
customized instruction or feedback to students. ITSs incorporate models of 
instructional content, which specify the teaching material, the teaching strategies and 
the way of teaching. ITS design is based on the individualized instruction, namely the 
instruction can be continuously adapted to best meet the needs of each student 
separately. Moreover, it offers students the possibility of learning in situations which 
more closely approximate the ones in which they will use their knowledge. 

Although ITSs are becoming more common, building an ITS needs careful 
preparation in terms of describing the knowledge and possible behaviors of tutors. 
This procedure demands the technical knowledge of tutors and special skills.

However, it is quite difficult for tutors to be familiarized with the programming of 
such systems. Hence, these drawbacks can be resolved by the use of the authoring 
tools, which aim at providing environments for cost-effective development of tutoring 
systems that can be intelligent and adaptive to individual students (Virvou and Alepis, 
2005). The design of an authoring tool addresses the following issues: 

1 . Using efficient methods, so that the build of an ITS is a cost-effective and a 

time-saving process. 

2. Reducing the technical knowledge and decreasing the skill threshold 

(programming skills) for authoring an ITS. 

3. Providing user interface friendliness. 

4. Helping tutors adapt the teaching material to specific needs. 

5. Designing methods of testing the tutors. 

The resulting authoring tool incorporates a knowledge based approach, which 
includes the following design principles (Murray, 2000): 

1. Represent instructional content and instructional strategies separately. 

2. Modularize the instructional content for multiple use and re-use. 

3. Creating generic teaching strategies that can be used with different 

instructional content. 

4. Explicitly represent abstract pedagogical entities. 

5. Design at the pedagogical level, when possible. 

In view of the above, in this paper we present a knowledge based authoring tool for 
an ITS. This authoring tool gives a non-programmer teacher the possibility of 
configuring different aspects of the afore-mentioned components, namely the domain 
knowledge, the student modeling component, the tutoring component and the user 
interface. We have tried to reduce the time and cost required, along with the 
programming skills to author an ITS. Our authoring tool has a variety of purposes and 
intended users and its design promotes the learnability and the productivity. 

This paper is organized as follows. First, we present the related work, concerning 
authoring tools in section 2. In section 3, we discuss our system's architecture. 
Following, in section 4, we present a description of our system, namely the way of 
authoring of crucial modules, a case study for the instructor and the student, an 
analysis concerning the student modeling and error diagnosis components and a 
modeling of the authoring process. Finally, in section 5, we come up with a discussion 
about the usability of the resulting authoring tool and we present our next plans. 

2 Related Work 

ITSs are computer-based systems that provide individualized tutoring to students. 
Once the ITS is created, authoring its learning material and exercises is an expensive 
job that requires the intervention of many people that are expert in different areas. 
Hence, the authoring tool allows the editing or updating of several parts of the ITS. 
For this reason, many researchers focus on the creation of effective authoring tools, 
some of which are presented below. 



Knowledge-Based Authoring Tool for Tutoring Multiple Languages 165 

E-Adventure is an authoring tool, developed by Torrente et al (2008) which is not 
only focused on the abstraction of the programming tasks, leaving the technical 
features of the game to programmers and media designers, but also on supporting 
those aspects that are specific of the educational domain, usually not contemplated in 
toolkits for commercial videogames. Scenejo is an authoring tool, implemented by 
Spierling et al (2006). Its special emphasis is on the construction of conversational 
threads for virtual actors using pattern matching, employing transition graph 
representations as the main interface for authoring. U-CREATE is a graphical 
authoring tool, developed by Sauer et al (2006) which aims at promoting the creation 
of elaborated contents in a fast and easy way and of interactive contents for advanced 
experiencing systems that already exist. CTAT is the authoring tool, implemented by 
Aleven et al (2006) that addresses to easier and efficient creation of tutors for both 
real-world use and use in experimental scenarios. The web-based ITS authoring tool 
by Virvou and Moundridou (2000) is targeted to domains that make use of algebraic 
equations. In authoring systems such as in FlexiTrainer (Ramachandran et al, 2004) 
and VersaTutor (Kodaganallur et al, 2004), there are no features which would enable 
the reuse of learning materials. Furthermore, the authoring tool which was developed 
by Choksey (2004) is able to build cognitive tutors and focuses on the assistance of 
author in design, development, implementing, testing, verifying and maintaining 
cognitive models. The authoring tool, developed by Jokela (2003), is concentrated on 
mobile phone based multimedia content. Moreover, Mobile Author is an authoring 
tool, which was implemented by Virvou and Alepis (2005) and allows instructors to 
create and administer data-bases, concerning characteristics of students, of the domain 
to be taught and of tests and homework, through any computer or mobile phone. 
Finally, BioWorld is an authoring tool, developed by Lajoie et al (2001) which 
promotes scientific reasoning in the medical domain. 

However, after a thorough investigation in the related scientific literature, we came 
up with the result that there was no implementation of authoring systems, which can 
be used for authoring multilingual systems that can create individual and personalized 
student models for each student and can perform error diagnosis to learners, through 
an intelligent way. The multilingual support enables students to learn three different 
languages in the same time and accept advice concerning the learning material and the 
exercises. 



3 Architecture of Our System 

The resulting tool incorporates knowledge about the construction of exercises and a 
mechanism for student error diagnosis, via a student model, that is applicable to many 
domains that make use of language learning. The development of our authoring tool 
addresses the design issues of an ITS as well as the issues of an authoring tool. The 
ITS that supports our system provides adaptive learning environment for the students 
by providing personalized instructions. It also offers possibilities of multilingual 
e-learning. It combines the learning of three languages, which are English, French and 
German. It is widely agreed that an ITS consists of four components, namely the 
domain knowledge, the student modeling component, the tutoring component and the 
user interface (Chou et al., 2003). The domain knowledge consists of a representation 



166 



M. Virvou and C. Troussas 



of the domain to be taught (e.g. Languages, Mathematics, etc.). The student modeling 
component stores some information about the student's performance or behaviors, 
including his/her knowledge level, his/her preferences, his/her learning history and 
helps the ITS to personalize the teaching strategy. The tutoring component contains a 
representation of the teaching strategies of the system and provides adaptive 
instructions to the students. Finally, the user interface provides the means for the 
student to interact with the ITS, usually through a graphical environment and 
sometimes through a rich simulation of the task domain the student is learning.

The authoring system is a layer above the ITS, which helps the teachers configure 
the different authorable modules of the ITS with minimum effort. It provides user- 
friendly environments for human instructors to develop their own ITSs of author 
some special features in an easy way. Naturally, the reasoning abilities of the resulting 
ITSs have to be provided by the authoring tools. Therefore, the authoring tools 
incorporate generic and domain-independent methods that can be customized to the 
particular tutoring domain of each instructor author (Virvou and Alepis, 2005). 

The resulting authoring tool is based on the following design principles (Murray, 
2003): 

1 . It has a clear knowledge representation and uses appropriate representational 

formalisms. 

2. It provides visual reification for the structure of the underlying 

representational framework, given that an authoring system is generally 



10 



Knowledge-Based Authoring Tool for Tutoring Multiple Languages 167 

used by non-programmers with a low degree of knowledge engineering and 

programming expertise. 
It provides tools which allow tutors to author using primitives that have 

instructional meaning. 
It represents and authors instructional content modularity so that is can be 

used for multiple instructional purposes. 

It provides features powerful enough to author generative content. 
It provides a powerful set of interface components that is it allows for 

interface extensibility. 

It facilitates an opportunistic design process. 
It facilitates the evolution to more powerful paradigms that is it allows a 

smooth transition from traditional authoring paradigms to authoring more 

powerful intelligent tutors. 

It includes customizable representational formalisms. 
It promotes the usability and productivity. 



Furthermore, the authoring process that is incorporated in our multilingual system, 
is promoted by the existence of a student model which keeps the students' profiles 
and provides individualized help and error proneness and diagnosis. 

The system's underlying architecture is illustrated in Fig. 2. The teacher's input is the 
domain description in terms of all the information needed to construct an exercise. This 
information is stored and managed by the Exercise Answering component, which 
interacts with the student while s/he is answering a question of an exercise. The Error 
Diagnoser component is responsible for finding out the cause of a student's mistake. 
The system, via the student model, can hold information about the performance of the 
student in one language. Then it can provide the student with the appropriate feedback 
for the other two languages, via the Advice Generator component. The student model is 
updated at every interaction of the student with the system and keeps the latest 
information for him/her. This information can help the system perform adaptive 
navigation support, which is considered important especially in distance learning 
situations, where the learning system has to play the role of the teacher and be able to 
help the student navigate through the course and support him/her individually in an 
exercise answering process (Specht and Oppermann, 1998).

4 Description of the System 

The following subsections give in detail the way with which the crucial parts of an 
ITS are authored. Furthermore, we present a case study for the instructor and the 
student and we describe thoroughly the student modeling and error diagnosis 
components. Finally, we visualize our system's processes, by using the Unified 
Modeling Language (UML). 

4.1 Authoring Domain Knowledge 

Authoring domain knowledge comprises of creating new course structures as well as 
modifying the existing ones. The teachers have the permission to create exercises, 
define the right answer, erase an exercise or simply make several changes on them. 
Moreover, this module consists of setting up the repository (Chakraborty ey al., 
2010). This process includes, inserting the available materials into the repository, as 
well as creating new learning materials. Given that our tool addresses to multiple 
language learning, we have implemented a platform where the teacher may edit the 
exercises of all the languages that are taught, in a simple way. 

4.2 Authoring Student Model 

Student Model is an abstract representation of the students' learning from the system, 
along with a student's profile, which includes personal information of him/her and 
other information concerning his/her performance and progress. It keeps track of 
student behaviors and makes inferences about what the student knows (Murray, 2003). 
A teacher can easily update a student's profile by interacting with the system, namely 
pressing buttons, choosing from a drop-down list and picking one from given multiple 
choices. Our system does not allow the teacher to make changes to the performance 
and the progress of the student. This prohibition ensures the integrity of the system. 
The student model can also be used as a "bug library", since misconceptions and 
buggy procedures can be defined to keep track of known classes of common 
deficiencies (Murray, 2003). 

Furthermore, this module offers the possibility to the teachers to register a new 
student so that s/he is able to make use of the system and learn multiple languages. 
This registration can be conducted by filling in a simple form with the student's 
username, name and surname and gender. 

4.3 Authoring of Teaching Model 

This is an automated module, which works dynamically and makes pedagogic 
decisions, depending on the information of students' performance gathered at run time 
(Chakraborty et al., 2010). Hence, the teachers do not have any direct control over the 
decision making procedures of this module. They get informed about the performance 
of the teachers, so that they can adapt the difficulty of the exercises to the level of each 
one student. This module promotes the individual and personalized learning and 
renders the students capable of filling all requirements of the educational procedure. 



Knowledge-Based Authoring Tool for Tutoring Multiple Languages 169 

4.4 Case Study for the Instructor 

When the instructor is going to create multiple choice exercises, s/he can fill in the 
form with the sentence and then s/he can add four different choices and thereafter 
define the right choice. After the construction of a multiple choice exercise, the tool 
lets the instructor preview it and then s/he can add it into the system, by pressing a 
button of acceptance. While students are tackling the given exercises, the system 
collects evidence about the level of difficulty so that it can provide feedback to the 
instructor. In this way, the instructor may edit a multiple choice exercise in order to 
adapt it to the level of knowledge of students. Nevertheless, there is one final test in 
the system that cannot be edited by the teachers. The students are asked to fill in the 
gaps of twenty given sentences. These sentences are chosen at random each time. The 
system may choose these sentences from the database, so that they are different for 
each student. In this way, we promote the diaphaneity in the students' performance 
evaluation. 

The authoring tool also incorporates a user modeling component that conducts 
diagnosis to the students' errors. This mechanism is used by the system when a 
student tackles the final exercise and is explained in detail in the next section. 

4.5 Case Study for the Student 

The system recognizes each student by his/her user name and his/her password, which 
were defined upon his/her registration. The domain knowledge of the resulting system 
consists of three languages, which are English, French and German. The system 
follows the same logical structure, for each one of these languages. This structure 
includes five novice level lessons for beginner students. The first lesson is the 
learning of the alphabet of the corresponding language. The alphabet is given both in 
capital and in minuscule letters. The second lesson encompasses the learning of 
months and days, along with their pronunciation. The third lesson encompasses the 
genders and the articles, so as to render the students capable of mastering these 
subjects. The fourth lesson describes in detail the personal and the possessive 
pronouns. The final lesson familiarizes students with the verbs "to be" and "have", as 
main verbs. An important issue considering these lessons is that the there is a multiple 
choice test for each one of the three last lessons, so that the students are evaluated and 
examined concerning their knowledge and comprehension of the previous lessons. If 
the students are not found to be adequately prepared to go on to the next lesson, they 
have to study again the relative theory. We used multiple choice exercises to evaluate 
their performance, as they are a mainstay of achieving testing and also provided us 
with the ability to measure the students' achievements (Rodriguez, 2005). The 
multiple choice questions can be authored by the teacher at any time, as it was 
described above. 

The advice generator is activated not only when a student makes an error, but also 
in every lesson, when the student has to study the theory. Initially, when a student 
uses the system for the first time, there is only an advice in each lesson, concerning 
the theory. When the student answers the multiple-exercises, then he is evaluated and 
gets information from the system in an appropriate way about his/her grade and also 
is permitted to pass to the next lesson, if his performance is satisfactory. 



170 M. Virvou and C. Troussas 

Furthermore, when a student has completed both the theory and the exercises of a 
lesson in one particular language, s/he has the possibility to do the same lesson in 
another language. In this way, the system will provide the student with advice, 
concerning the new theory to be taught and also the differences with the other 
languages that s/he was taught. 

A matter of great importance is the existence of the final test, which is an exercise 
where the student is asked to fill in the gaps of a specific sentence. After completing 
the test, the student can check his/her performance and take advice about the point 
where the error lies and the categories of error. The questions of this test are adapted 
to the student's performance so they are different each time. While the student is in 
the process of answering this exercise, the system monitors his/her actions. If the 
student makes a mistake, the diagnostic component of the system will attempt to 
diagnose the cause of it. The diagnosis of the underlying cause of a mistake is a 
difficult task for an ITS because the observable symptoms need to be analyzed 
further. As Hollnagel (1993) pointed out, there is an important distinction between the 
underlying cause or genotype of an error and the observable manifestation or 
phenotype of the error. In the final test, the system recognizes the errors and 
associates them with the lessons taught by the system. There are five categories of 
errors that can be recognized by the system: 

1 . Article and pronoun mistakes 

For example the user may have used "a" instead of "an" or "he" instead of 
"we". 

2. Spelling mistakes 

A spelling mistake is a result of letter redundancy, letter missing or 
interchange of two neighboring letters. 

3. Verb mistakes 

Verb mistakes occur when the user has typed another person than the 
correct one, for example s/he may have typed "I has" instead of "I have". 

4. Unanswered questions 

The user may have no idea about what s/he should write and leave the 
question unanswered. That means that s/he has lack in theory. 

5. Language Confusion 

Our system is a multilingual learning system, which means that a student 
may learn three languages at the same time. However, there is the 
possibility of student's getting confused, concerning the proper use of an 
article or verb. Namely, the student may have used "I am" instead of "Je 
suis", which is the French equivalent. 

4.6 Student Modeling and Error Diagnosis 

Student modeling represents the computer system's belief about the learner's 
knowledge, namely it is responsible for the creation of a student's profile with all the 



Knowledge-Based Authoring Tool for Tutoring Multiple Languages 171 

crucial information about him/her. It is generally used in connection with applications 
computer-based instructional systems. Student modeling is crucial for an intelligent 
learning environment to be able to adapt to the needs and knowledge of individual 
students. Virvou et al. (2000) support that the student modeler is responsible for 
preserving the system's estimation of the learner's proficiency in the domain as well 
as his/her proneness to commit errors. 

Our system constructs a student model, which gives assistance to the learner, 
providing feedback or interprets his/her behavior. One significant element is that 
before the student's starting a multiple-choice test in another language, the system 
informs him/her about his/her performance in the corresponding test of the lesson of 
the already taught language and gives him/her advice concerning the test s/he is about 
to do. Moreover, concerning the final test, the student modeler checks the student's 
answer and in case of an error and it performs error diagnosis. In this case, the system 
checks the complexion of the error and acts in a way that it will be described in the 
next section. 

A matter of great importance is the existence of a long term user model for each 
student. The system includes also a form, which keeps information about the student's 
progress in the three languages, the total grade in each one of the three languages and 
all the results of the tests. Cook and Kay (1994) have shown that students benefit 
from viewing their own student models. For this reason, this form can be presented to 
students so that they stay aware of their advance of knowledge. 

Chapelle (1998) points out that CALL programs must promote noticing (focus on 
form) that will result in the improvement of students' existing grammatical 
knowledge. This can be accomplished by evaluating the students' performance 
through several tests. In our system, there are two types of tests as mentioned above, 
which are the multiple choice exercises and the exercises where the user is asked to 
fill in the gap inside a sentence. 

Multiple choice questions are the most widely used and highly regarded of the 
selection- type questions (Rodriguez, 2005). Multiple choice exercises are a form of 
assessment in which the user asked to select the best possible answer out of the 
choices from a list. One of them is the correct, while the others answers are erroneous. 
In our system, we have developed a library, which keeps all the erroneous answers 
and correlates them with a category of error, so that the student should have an 
integral idea of his/her knowledge and know exactly where s/he has weaknesses in. 

In the final test, the student is asked to fill in the gap inside a sentence. The system 
examines the student's knowledge in all the lessons which have been taught in each 
language separately. There are twenty questions, which are different for each student 
and based on his/her user model. After completing the gaps, the system gives the 
results of the final examination. It shows the grade of the student and spots the 
erroneous answers. Furthermore, the system corresponds to the erroneous answers for 
each category of errors and gives a percentage that helps students understand in which 
lesson they have deficiencies. 

Fig. 3 illustrates the relationship between the Student Modeling and Error 
Diagnosis components and gives an overview of the system.

The following sequence diagrams in UML describe the sequences of messages of our 
authoring system. Fig. 4 illustrates the updating of a student's profile by the teacher. 
Fig. 5 illustrates the editing of multiple choice exercises. The dotted lines extending 
downwards indicate the timeline. Time flows from top to bottom. The arrows 
represent the messages (stimuli) from an actor or object to other objects. The actor 
"Student" exists in all the diagrams, but s/he cannot send or receive messages, given 
that s/he does not participate in the authoring process.

5 Conclusions 



In this paper, we have described a knowledge-based authoring tool that models the 
domain of knowledge, the teaching strategies and the student states. The resulting 
knowledge-based tutor has the following features: 



A representation of the knowledge to be taught. 

Learning material is separate from learning strategies. 

A student model exists, makes inferences about the student's state and is 

connected to an error diagnosis component which promotes the educational 

and authoring processes. 
Instructional content is adapted to students' state. 
Instructional decisions are predicated upon the inferred student state. 



Our authoring system is a useful tool for teachers with no programming skills, who 
want to author the multilingual learning material. This authoring process can be 
conducted by using a sophisticated editor in a user friendly environment. In this way, 
we aim at decreasing the effort it takes to build instructional systems. With the same 



174 M. Virvou and C. Troussas 

effort, our system can help increasing the adaptivity, depth and effectiveness of 
resulting instructional systems. 

It is in our future plans to evaluate our authoring tool in order to examine the 
degree of usefulness of the educational tool for the teachers who are going to author 
parts of the ITS. Furthermore, we are going to evaluate the usefulness of the student 
model and error diagnosis components for the learners who are going to use the 
multilingual educational system.

Abstract. This paper presents how a fuzzy multi-criteria decision making the- 
ory has been used for evaluating an e-learning system with affective interaction 
capabilities. More specifically, as a test-bed for our evaluation we have used an 
e-learning system that teaches a programming language. This programming lan- 
guage is similar to the well known Logo programming language, while it incor- 
porates a more user-friendly graphical user interface with the presence of ani- 
mated tutoring characters. In our evaluation we have compared the affective 
system with a standard programming language learning environment and the re- 
sults have revealed a general preference of the users in using the affective sys- 
tem than the standard system. 



1 Introduction 

In the last decade, the research field of affective computing has become a very impor- 
tant and popular because it focuses on recognizing and reproducing human feelings 
within human computer interaction. Human feelings are considered very important 
but only recently have started being taken into account in user interfaces. However, 
analyzing and eliciting human emotion is very complicated and as Picard points out 
(Picard, 2003) there is little hope that computers will accurately understand human 
feelings during the next decades. This derives from the fact that human emotions are 
very idiosyncratic and variable and emotion recognition is quite difficult even in hu- 
man-human interaction. Thus, the area of affective computing is not yet well under- 
stood and needs a lot more research to reach maturity. 

Cognitive science has opened new paths in exploring human behavior by techno- 
logical means and software improvements, while in the past the development of affec- 
tive computer interfaces was basically a technology-driven phenomenon (Picard, 
2003). The specific research is quite promising considering that to date, most state-of- 
the art multimodal interfaces consist of more than one mode. Systems that combine 
speech and keyboard input and systems that combine speech and facial detection 
constitute two most extensively developed and supported areas within the fields of 
human-computer interaction (Pantic, M. & Rothkrantz, 2003).

In the past, the authors of this paper have developed systems that incorporate emo- 
tion recognition capabilities, based on several programming techniques and algo- 
rithmic approaches (Alepis et al. 2009, Alepis et al. 2010). These systems showed 
significant results in recognizing and reproducing emotions. However, our next goal 
was to evaluate such a system by exploring its benefits in terms of user interaction in 
comparison with a standard non affective interaction system. 

In view of the above, we have used a programming language e-learning system that 
incorporated affective interaction mechanisms. The system was evaluated in compari- 
son to a standard system that does not incorporate any intelligence using Fuzzy Sim- 
ple Additive Weighting (FSAW) (Chou et al. 2008). Indeed, the evaluation of 
software involves several criteria and, therefore, can be considered as a multi-criteria 
problem. Especially, the FSAW theory was selected because it is rather simple and 
has the advantage of allowing multi-criteria problems to accommodate linguistic 
terms represented as fuzzy numbers. This facilitates the creation of a decision proce- 
dure that is more realistic than other existing theories (Chou et al. 2008). 

2 Fuzzy Simple Additive Weighting 

Zadeh (1965) pioneered the use of Fuzzy Set Theory (FST) to address problems in- 
volving fuzzy phenomena. In a universe of discourse X, a fuzzy subset "â  of -^ is 
defined with a membership function jil s (x) that maps each element x in X to a real 

number in the interval [0, 1]. The function value of // g (x) signifies the grade of 

membership of x in "â  . When JU S (x) is large, its grade of membership of x in A is 
strong (Keufmann & Gupta, 1991). 

A fuzzy set A = (a,b, C,d) on R, a < b < c < d, is called a trapezoidal fuzzy 
number if its membership function is 



(b- 


â -,a<x<b 
-a) 


1, 


b <x<c 


(x- 
ic- 


~ d \c<x<d 

-d) 


0, 


otherwise 



MaW : 



where a, b, c, d are real numbers (Dubois & Prade 1978, Keufmann & Gupta 1991). 

Trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are the most widely used forms of fuzzy numbers be- 
cause they can be handled arithmetically and interpreted intuitively. 

The FSAWS procedure based on above conceptual model is as follows: 

Step 1: Form a committee of decision-makers. Choose the attributes and identify the 
prospective alternatives. A committee of decision-makers is formed to determine the 
most appropriate alternative. 

Step 2: Determine the degree of importance (or reliability) of the decision-makers. If 
the degrees of importance (or reliability) of decision-makers are equal, then the group 



Evaluating an Affective e-Learning System Using a Fuzzy Decision Making Method 179 

, , r 1 

of decision-makers is deemed a homogeneous group (7j â l 2 ~---~'k ~ â ) ; 

k 
otherwise, the group of decision-makers is called a heterogeneous (non- 
homogeneous) group. 

Step 3: Introduce linguistic weighting variables (Table 1) for decision-makers to 
assess attributes importance, and compute aggregated fuzzy weights of individual 

attributes. Let W jt = (a jt , b jt , C jt , d jt ) , j â 1,2,..., n\ t â 1,2,..., k be the linguis- 
tic weight given to subjective attributes C 1 ,C 2 ,...,C A and objective attributes 
C h+l ,C h+2 ,...,C n by decision-maker D t . The aggregated fuzzy attribute 
weight, W: = (a :,b:,C ,d ) , j = 1,2,. ..,ll of attribute C assessed by the com- 
mittee of k decision makers is defined as 
W J .=(/ 1 Â®W, 1 )e(/ 2 Â®W, 2 )e...e(/ u (8)W J ,), where a,. =^7^,, 

b j = YLj* b Â» > c j = Ht^tCj, t d j = YL', d Â» 

Step 4: Defuzzify the fuzzy weights of individual attributes; compute the normalized 
weights and construct the weight vector. 

To defuzzify the weights of the fuzzy attributes, the signed distance is adopted. 

The defuzzification of W â  , denoted as d(W ) is therefore given by 
d(Wj ) = - (a j + bj + c. + d . ) , j = 1,2,..., n 

The crisp value of the normalized weight for attribute C denoted as W â  , is given 
by 

W,= -^, j = l,2,...,n, 

where 2, â _ W; = 1 â  The weight vector W = [W 1 ,W 2 ,...,W n ] is therefore formed. 

Step 5: Use linguistic rating variables (Table 2) for decision-makers to assess fuzzy 
ratings of alternatives with respect to individual subjective attributes, and then pool 

them to obtain the aggregated fuzzy ratings. Let X ijt = (o^ , p it , q v , S ijt ) , 
i = l,2,...,m , j = l,2,...,h , t =1,2,..., k be the linguistic suitability rating as- 
signed to alternative location A i for subjective attribute C â  by decision-maker D t . 
Let us further define X ijt as the aggregated fuzzy rating of alternative A i for subjec- 
tive attribute C , such that

^=(/ t Â®%)0(/ 2 <S>*, 2 )0...0(/ U Â®x ijk ) 
which can subsequently be represented and computed as

where O tj = Â£,V^ , Pij = ^IjtPijt - ^ = Z f V^ ' S U = Zti 7 '*SÂ» ' 
Step 6: Construct a fuzzy rating matrix based on fuzzy ratings. The fuzzy rating ma- 
trix M can be concisely expressed in matrix format 



M 



where X ti ,vi,j is the aggregated fuzzy rating of alternative A i , i = l,2,...,m with 

respect to attribute C â  . 

Step 8: Derive total fuzzy scores for individual alternatives by multiplying the fuzzy 
rating matrix by their respective weight vectors.

corresponding weight vector W, i.e.,

where / ( = (r ( ,^, ?,,Â«,), z' = l,2,...,m. 

Step 9: Compute a crisp value for each total score using a defuzzification method and 
select the alternative(s) with the maximum total score. 

Rank total fuzzy scores f 1 ,f 2 ,...,f by the signed distance to determine the best 

location. Determine crisp total scores of individual locations by the following defuzzi- 
fication equation: 

d(f l )=^(r l +s i +t l +u i ),i = l2,...,m 



Evaluating an Affective e-Learning System Using a Fuzzy Decision Making Method 181 

where d(f ) gives the defuzzified value (crisp value) of the total fuzzy score of loca- 
tion A. by using the signed distance. The ranking of the locations can then be pre- 
ceded with the above crisp value of the total scores for individual alternatives. 

3 Overall Description of the System 

In this section we give a short overview of the affective e-learning system. As we 
have mentioned the system that incorporates the affective capabilities was a computer 
assisted programming language learning system. The affective system also incorpo- 
rated an emotional animated tutoring character that was present during the e-learning 
process in order to make the interaction more human-like. The tutoring character 
would try to sympathise with the aims of each user as student and would try to elicit 
human emotions.

gramming commands in order to produce a complicated drawing. In figure 2 we may 
see the tutoring character that congratulates a user for producing a very complicated 
drawing by using the programming language. While the users interact with the

affective system is beyond the scopes of this paper that aims basically in the system's 
evaluation. 



4 Evaluation Experiment 

For the evaluation of the system, the evaluation experiment was designed taking into 
account the steps of the FSAW method. For this purpose a committee of the decision- 
makers was formed to evaluate the system. The committee of decision makers was 
consisted of 10 users that were randomly selected; 4 teachers, 4 students, and 2 soft- 
ware engineers. The group of decision makers was homogeneous as the reliability 
(importance) of the decision-makers was equal. The criteria that were taken into ac- 
count for the evaluation of the system was: 



Affective Adaptation (AT): this criterion shows how successful the system 
was in adapting its interaction to the emotions to the user interacting to the 
system. 



Evaluating an Affective e-Learning System Using a Fuzzy Decision Making Method 183 

â  User friendly (Uf): the specific criterion shows what the users think about the 
interaction with the adaptive system, whether it is intrusive or not, whether it 
provides natural interaction etc. 

â  Needs fulfillment (Nf): this criterion shows how successful the system was 
in addressing the users' needs and presenting the appropriate information to 
the user. 

â  Interest satisfaction (Is): this criterion reveals how successful the system was 
in addressing the users' interests. 

The decision makers were first asked to evaluate the above mentioned attributes 
with respect to their importance in adaptive software evaluation. This procedure re- 
sulted in aggregated fuzzy weights of individual attributes. For the evaluation of the 
above mentioned criteria the decision makers used the linguistic variables presented 
in table 1 .

High (H)

Very high (VH) 


(7, 10, 10, 10) 



As soon as all the linguistic variables of the criteria weights were collected, the 
fuzzy weights of the criteria are calculated. More specifically, each linguistic variable 
is translated to a fuzzy number as this is presented in table 1. These values are used 
for calculating the aggregated fuzzy weight for each one of the four attributes: 

W Af =(4.1,1 3,1 3,9 A), W Uf =(5.3,7.7,7.7,9.8), W N/ =(1.0,3.4,3.4,6.1), 

Wj = (4.2,6.8,6.8,9.2) . These weights are defuzzified according to the step 4 of the 

theory: d(W A/ ) = 12, d(Wy ) = 7.6, d(W Nf ) = 3.5, d(W Uf ) = 6.S. The 

crisp values of the normalized weights are calculated: 

d(W,) 12 d(W ) 7. 6 

W A = - 4 =^ = 0.29 , W a =â -I â = ^- = 0.30, 

' ^ M d(W i ) 25.1 Uf ^ M d(W v ) 25.1 

d (W Nf ) 3.5 d(W { ) 6.8 

W N =â -I â = ^^ = 0.14, W, = - -4 =-^ = 0.27. The 

Nf ^ 4 M d(W Nf ) 25.1 'â  ^d<W It ) 25.1 

weight vector is, therefore, formed to W = (0.29,0.30,0.14,0.27) .

The linguistic rating variables were processed using the formulae of step 5 of the 
algorithm in order to obtain the aggregated fuzzy ratings. The detailed presentation of 
the calculations is beyond the scope of this paper and, therefore, only the results of 
this processing are presented in the fuzzy rating matrix (Table 3).

What seems rather interesting is that the users not only value more the affective 
system in the attributes related to the affection but they are influenced when evaluat- 
ing the adaptive system in other criteria that do not seem directly related. In order to 
derive the total fuzzy scores for individual alternative, the fuzzy rating matrix is mul- 
tiplied by the corresponding weight vector W.

Evaluating an Affective e-Learning System Using a Fuzzy Decision Making Method 185 

The crisp value for each total score is computed using the defuzzification method. 

d(f 1 ) = â(61.5 + 81.5 + 86.9 + 97.0) = 326.8 
d(f 2 ) = -(26.3 + 44.6 + 55.2 + 75.2) = 201,2 

The crisp value of the first alternative that corresponds to the affective system is 
much higher than the crisp value of the standard learning system. As a result, the 
users seem to prefer in general the affective system than a standard learning system. 

6 Conclusions 

In this paper, we described how a fuzzy multi-criteria decision making theory can be 
used for evaluating an affective learning system. The theory that was selected was the 
FSAW theory. The particular theory is very simple and uses linguistic terms. Indeed, 
previous studies (e.g. Virvou & Kabassi 2003) revealed that users had a difficulty in 
quantifying criteria while evaluating a software system. Therefore, in this case, 
FSAW was selected that uses linguistic terms that can be further translated into fuzzy 
numbers. This results in making the procedure more realistic, suitable, user friendly 
and effective. 

The users as decision makers who participated in the evaluation experiment seem 
to prefer in general the affective system than a standard learning system. Moreover, 
the evaluation experiment revealed that the affective characteristic of the adaptive e- 
learning system influenced the users while evaluating other parameters of the system 
such as the satisfaction of the users' needs.

Abstract. Adaptive content selection is recognized as a challenging research is- 
sue in adaptive educational hypermedia systems (AEHS). Several efforts have 
been reported in literature aiming to support the Adaptation Model (AM) design 
by providing AEHS designers with either guidance for the direct definition of 
adaptation rules, or semi-automated mechanisms which generate the AM via the 
implicit definition of such rules. The goal of the semi-automated, decision- 
based approaches is to generate a continuous decision function that estimates 
the desired AEHS response, aiming to overcome the insufficiency and/or incon- 
sistency problems of the defined adaptation rule sets. Although such approaches 
bare the potential to provide efficient AMs, they still miss a commonly accepted 
framework for evaluating their performance. In this paper, we propose an 
evaluation framework suitable for validating the performance decision-based 
approaches in adaptive learning objects selection in AEHS and demonstrate the 
use of this framework in the case of our proposed decision-based approach for 
estimating the desired AEHS response. 



1 Introduction 

Adaptive Educational Hypermedia Systems (AEHS) have been proposed as the un- 
derlying facilitator for personalized web-based learning with the general aim of per- 
sonalizing learning experiences for a given learner [1]. In order to adaptively select 
and sequence learning objects in AEHS, the definition of adaptation behaviour, re- 
ferred to as Adaptation Model, is required. The Adaptation Model (AM) contains the 
rules for describing the runtime behaviour of the AEHS. Typically, these rules include 
Concept Selection Rules which are used for selecting appropriate concepts from the 
Domain Model to be covered, Content Selection Rules which are used for selecting 
appropriate resources from the Media Space, as well as, Sequencing Rules which are 
used for generating appropriate learning paths (sequences of learning objects) for a 
given learner [2] . 

In the literature, there exist different approaches aiming to support the Adaptation 
Model design by providing AEHS designers with either guidance for the direct defini- 
tion of adaptation rules, or semi-automated mechanisms which generate the AM via

the implicit definition of such rules [3], [4]. The main drawback of the direct defini- 
tion of adaptation rules is that there can be cases during the run-time execution of 
AEHS where no adaptation decision can be made due to insufficiency and/or incon- 
sistency of the defined adaptation rule sets [5]. This is due to the fact that, even if 
appropriate resources exist in the Media Space, the absence of a required rule (insuf- 
ficiency problem) or the conflict between two or more rules (inconsistency problem), 
prevents the AEHS to select and use them in the generated learning resource 
sequence. The goal of the semi-automated approaches is to generate a continuous de- 
cision function that estimates the desired AEHS response, overcoming the above 
mentioned problems [6]. Although such approaches bare the potential to provide 
efficient Adaptation Models, they still miss a commonly accepted framework for 
evaluating their performance. 

In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework suitable for validating the per- 
formance decision-based approaches in adaptive learning objects selection in AEHS 
and demonstrate the use of this framework in the case of our proposed decision-based 
approach for estimating the desired AEHS response. In [3], we have presented a semi- 
automated approach for extracting the content selection rules of the AM in AEHS. In 
this paper, we use this approach to demonstrate and verify the capacity of the pro- 
posed evaluation framework. 

The paper is structured as follows: First, we discuss the performance evaluation 
metrics that have been proposed by the literature for validating the use of decision- 
based approaches. Then, we present the proposed performance evaluation methodol- 
ogy for decision-based content selection approaches in AEHS, and set up and report 
simulation-based experiments, following the above mentioned methodology, which 
aim to validate these evaluation metrics within the framework of our previously pro- 
posed method for estimating the desired AEHS response. Finally, we discuss our find- 
ings and the conclusions that can be offered. 

2 Performance Evaluation Metrics for Decision-Based AEHS 

In adaptive content selection several approaches have been proposed by the literature. 
The most commonly used are the following [7]: 

- Concept/Keyword-based Selection. In these approaches, searching is performed 
based on a set of keywords, typically representing the desired concepts to be covered 
from the retrieved learning objects. In AEHS, these keywords are defined over the 
Domain Concept Ontology during the concept selection process. In this case, the 
ranking of learning objects is performed using a concept/keyword-based similarity 
formula [8]. 

- Preference-based Selection. In these approaches, selection is performed based on 
the comparison of the learner profile in hand with the metadata description of the 
learning objects. In this case, the ranking of learning objects is performed using a 
preference score [6], [9], which evaluates the utility/suitability of each learning object 
for the learner profile in hand. 



Performance Evaluation of Adaptive Content Selection in AEHS 1 89 

In both techniques general purpose evaluation metrics are used from the field of 
information extraction [10]. More specifically, precision and recall measures are ap- 
plied in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the learning objects selection technique, 
in terms of accuracy and completeness respectively. Precision is the ratio of correct 
responses to the sum of correct and incorrect responses. Recall is the number of cor- 
rect system responses divided by the sum of correct, incorrect and missing system re- 
sponses. In order to have a single evaluation metric, F-measure is used, which is a 
weighted combination of recall and precision. 

However, AEHS implement a content selection strategy which limits the number of 
retrieved learning objects, aiming to restrict the amount of information provided to 
learners at a given time instance, due to the problem of learners' cognitive overload 
[11]. As a result, the precision should be measured not on the entire Media Space, but 
only on the desired sub-space which represent a set of the n most preferred learning 
objects, where n is the number of the desired learning objects. If not, the resulting 
precision would be higher or equal to the real one, since the number of retrieved 
learning objects is less or equal to the number of desired learning objects at a given 
time instance. Moreover, since the resulting LO space is restricted, the recall measure 
should also be measured over the space of the n most relevant learning objects, and 
not over the space of all relevant learning objects. This introduces the need for an al- 
ternative evaluation metric in adaptive content selection. In this paper we propose an 
evaluation framework, presented in next section, which uses a variation of the evalua- 
tion metric defined in [3]. The new metric is defined as follows: 

( correct ranked Learning Objects selected \ 

Selection Success (%) = 100 * 

I requested Learning Objects J 

In this paper, we present simulation based experiments verifying this hypothesis, and 
demonstrate that the proposed metric is harder than the precision metric, since it 
measures the precision over a smaller value space. 

3 Evaluation Methodology for Decision-Based AEHS 

The underlying hypothesis of the design of a decision-based approach for content se- 
lection in AEHS is that it is feasible to construct a semi-automated algorithm, which 
generates a continuous decision function that estimates the desired AEHS response. 
Thus, the goal of evaluating such an approach is twofold: first, to examine whether a 
proposed semi-automated decision based approach is capable of extracting decision 
models which replicate the Adaptation Model (AM) of existing AEHS; and second, to 
verify via performance evaluation that this approach can be applied in cases where 
large-scale adaptation rule sets are needed to describe the desired AEHS response. To 
this end, the evaluation should be performed in two phases: 

- Phase A: Extracting the AM of existing AEHS. In this evaluation phase, the Adap- 
tation Model (AM) rules of existing AEHS are used for generating sample adaptation 
decisions. These decisions have the form of combinations of learning objects mapped 
to learner profiles, and are used to train the intelligent mechanism that fits the 



190 P. Karampiperis and D.G. Sampson 

response function on these data. The goal of this phase is to examine whether the pro- 
posed semi-automated decision based approach is capable of extracting the decision 
model of the AEHS in hand. In our experiments, we will try to extract the AM rules 
for content selection used in the INSPIRE [12] system. 

- Phase B: Scaling up the experiments. As already discussed, the problem of defin- 
ing adaptation rules is a combinatorial problem, which means that in order to design 
sufficient and consistent adaptation rule sets, all the combinations of the adaptation 
decision variables should be covered. However, these combinations can be millions 
[3], leading to huge rule sets that is difficult to author, manage and verify their suffi- 
ciency and/or consistency. To this end, in order to keep the adaptation rule set human- 
maintainable, existing AEHS in the literature use few adaptation variables, typically 
2-4 variables for describing learners' behaviour and 2-3 variables for describing edu- 
cational content. The goal of this evaluation phase is to verify that the proposed ap- 
proach can be applied in cases where large-scale adaptation rule sets are needed to de- 
scribe the desired AEHS response. In order to do this, we simulate the existence of an 
AEHS that uses as many adaptation variables as possible. These variables (learner 
profile properties and educational description model properties) are selected from the 
elements of wide-spread Learning Technology standards. However, special attention 
should be given in generating learner profiles and educational content metadata re- 
cords that simulate real-life conditions. Details on how such datasets are generated are 
given in next section. 



4 Setting Up the Experiments 

As already described, the adaptation model design is the process of defining (a) the 
concept selection rules which are used for selecting appropriate concepts from the 
Domain Model to be covered, (b) the content selection rules which are used for select- 
ing appropriate resources from the Media Space, and (c) the sequencing rules which 
are used for generating appropriate learning paths (sequences of learning objects) for 
a given learner, based on learner's profile stored in the Learner Model. In this paper, 
we focus on content selection rules, thus, before executing our experiments for meas- 
uring the performance of adaptive selection of learning objects, we need to design (a) 
the Media Space, and (b) the Learner Model. 

4.1 Designing the Media Space 

In the first phase of the evaluation, we will extract the AM of the INSPIRE system 
[12]. The INSPIRE system uses two variables in the Educational Resource Descrip- 
tion Model, namely, the Performance Level and the Learning Resource Type. In the 
second evaluation phase, we simulate the existence of an AEHS where large-scale ad- 
aptation rule sets are needed to describe the desired AEHS response. To do so, we 
have used as Educational Resource Description Model a subset of the IEEE Learning 
Object Metadata standard elements [13]. 

In both evaluation phases, we need to simulate real-life conditions. This means that 
the simulated learning object metadata records should have a distribution over their 
value spaces similar to the metadata value distribution found in real-life learning

object repositories. Najjar and Duval [14], presented a statistical analysis of the actual 
use of IEEE LOM metadata elements in the ARIADNE learning object repository. 
The results were derived from analyzing the empirical data (usage logs) of 3,700 
ARIADNE metadata instances.

Table 1 shows the percentage of times each ARIADNE data element was filled in 
by indexers during the indexing process. From the data shown in Table 1, we notice 
that only one data element is almost always used: the Aggregation Level element. 
Other elements are used in about 50 % of the descriptions. For the values of data 
elements, we can see that indexers often use just one value. As a result, in order to 
simulate in our experiments the metadata of a real-world repository, we will generate 
metadata records with normal distribution over the metadata elements value space, 
simulating that not all metadata elements and their corresponding vocabulary terms are 
used equally. Normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is often 
used to describe random variables that tend to cluster around a single mean value. 



4.2 Designing the Learner Model 

In the first phase of the evaluation, we will extract the AM of the INSPIRE system 
[12]. The INSPIRE system uses two variables in the Learner Model, namely, the 
Learner's Knowledge Level and the Learner's Learning Style). In the second evalua- 
tion phase, we simulate the existence of an AEHS where large-scale adaptation rule 
sets are needed to describe the desired AEHS response. To do so, for the design of the 
Learner Model in our simulations we have used an overlay model for representing the 
Learners Knowledge Space and a stereotype model for representing learners' prefer- 
ences. More precisely, for the learners' knowledge level we assume the existence of a 
related certification for each node of the Learners Knowledge Space, the evaluation 
score in testing records and the number of attempts made on the evaluation. For model- 
ling of learners' preferences we use learning styles according to Honey and Mumford 
model [15], as well as modality preference information consisting of four modality 
types, namely, the visual modality, the textual modality, the auditory modality and any 
combination of the three modality preferences [16]. Each element of the Learner 
Model was mapped to the IMS Learner Information Package specification [17]. 

In order to simulate in our experiments the profiles of real learners we generated 
profile records using truncated standard lognormal distribution with [sigma]=l and 
reduced by factor 1/5. This distribution is often used in the literature for simulating 
learner behaviour [18].

4.3 Simulating the AM of an AEHS 

The goal of our experiments is to evaluate the suitability of the set of performance 
evaluation metrics, presented in the previous section, for validating the use of deci- 
sion-based approaches for adaptive learning objects selection in AEHS, and assess the 
use of these metrics in the case of our previously proposed statistical method for esti- 
mating the desired AEHS response. 

Performance evaluation in this context means measuring (a) how well our semi- 
automated approach fits the decision function to the provided model adaptation deci- 
sions (training data), and (b) how well this decision function responds to decision 
cases not known during the training process (generalisation capacity). 

As a result, we need to produce model adaptation decisions and compare them with 
the corresponding response of our decision-based approach. Some of these model ad- 
aptation decisions will be used for training our method, and some will be used for 
measuring its' generalisation capacity. In the first evaluation phase, the Adaptation 
Model (AM) rules of an existing AEHS are used for generating sample adaptation de- 
cisions. In the second evaluation phase, we need to simulate the existence of an 
AEHS that uses as many adaptation variables as possible. Since such an AEHS does 
not exist, we will simulate model adaptation decisions via the use of simulated in- 
structional designers' preference models. These models have been selected in such a 
way that the preference surface is complex, thus, it would be a difficult task for the 
decision based algorithm to fit the training data. 

To achieve this, we use as an instructional designers' preference model a multi- 
variable function, with 18 variables (k). These variables model the eleven (11) ele- 
ments of the Educational Resource Description Model in use (that is, the elements 
used from the "General" and the "Educational" IEEE LOM categories) and the seven 
(7) elements of the Learner Model in use [10]. We assume that the response of this 
function expresses the utility of a given learning object for a given learner profile 
(preference-based selection problem). In our experiments, we simulate the preference 
models of five (5) instructional designers, using the functions presented in Table 2.

Performance Evaluation of Adaptive Content Selection in AEHS 193 

For evaluating the performance, we have generated a set of 1.000 learning object 
metadata records and a set of 100 learner profiles. In each experiment, 50% of the 
available learning objects metadata records, randomly selected, were used for algo- 
rithmic training and the rest 50% for measuring the generalisation, that is, the estima- 
tion capacity, of the algorithm. Similarly, in each experiment 50% randomly selected 
of the available learner profiles were used for algorithmic training and the rest 50% 
for measuring the generalisation of the algorithm. 



5 Experimental Results and Discussion 

In this section, we present experimental results from the execution of the above men- 
tioned evaluation methodology for the case of our previously proposed statistical 
method for estimating the desired AEHS response [3]. The results are presented per 
evaluation phase. 

5.1 Extracting the AM of existing AEHS 

Our first experiment was the application of our decision-based approach for replicat- 
ing the Adaptation Model (AM) of an existing AEHS. To this end, we simulated the 
AM of the INSPIRE [[ HYPERLINK \1 "Pap03" 12 ], produced sample adaptation 
rules in the form of combinations of learning objects mapped to learner profiles, and 
applied our methodology to extract the AM. The INSPIRE system uses two variables 
from the Learner Model (namely, the Learner's Knowledge Level and the Learner's 
Learning Style) and two variables from the Educational Resource Description Model 
(namely, the Performance Level and the Learning Resource Type), for performing ad- 
aptation decisions according to Table 3.

Figure 1, presents the INSPIRE' s AM dependencies of the Learning Style and 
Learning Resource Type in the LO utility space, whereas Figure 2 presents the same 
dependencies of the produced AM when our decision based approach is applied. From 
these figures we can observe that the produced adaptation model is a super class of 
the INSPIRE' s AM, since it contains more adaptation rules (dependencies between 
learning object and learner characteristics). Moreover, we can observe that the pro- 
duced AM has a continuous contour in the Utility Space, which means that this AM 
has the ability to always propose learning objects.

After the above experiment, the research question was to investigate if the pro- 
posed decision based approach has the capacity of learning more complex Adaptation 
Models, consisting of many free variables with complex preference surfaces, thus, it 
would be a difficult task for the decision based algorithm to fit the training data. This 
is the goal of the second evaluation phase, which is presented in next section. 



5.2 Scaling Up the Experiments 

Before proceeding with the performance evaluation of our decision-based approach, 
we have conducted an additional experiment, aiming to assess the use of the perform- 
ance evaluation metrics proposed by the literature. 

Our semi-automated approach for adaptive content selection uses a preference- 
based learning objects selection mechanism based on the use of a suitability function 
that estimates the utility of a given learning object for a given learner [3]. 

In order to compare the performance evaluation metrics discussed in previous sec- 
tion, we evaluate the performance using randomly generated datasets which serve as 
model adaptation decisions and vary in size. The size of these datasets depends on the 
number of ranked learning objects for a given number of learner profiles. In real con- 
ditions, these rankings would be requested from an instructional designer. In our 
experiments, these rankings are the result of the application of the simulated instruc- 
tional designers' preference models presented in Table 4. As already described, the 
datasets were divided into two subsets: the training dataset, which was used for algo- 
rithmic training and for evaluating the performance during the training process, and

the generalization dataset, which was used for measuring the generalization capacity 
of the algorithm. Each experiment was executed 100 times using a randomly selected 
instructional designers' preference model. 

Figure 3 (left column) presents average selection performance results during algo- 
rithmic training, when using different simulation parameters regarding the number of 
learner profiles and the number of learning object metadata records used. In each ex- 
periment, the selection performance was measured when using different values of the 
parameter n (varying from 10 to 500), which expresses the maximum number of re- 
quested learning objects from the Media Space. In this figure the performance evalua- 
tion was measured using the typical Precision Metric (PM), the proposed alternative 
metric for Selection Success (SS), as well as, by applying the PM metric only on the 
desired sub-space of the Media Space (Partial Precision Metric, PPM). From these re- 
sults we observe the following: 



196 P. Karampiperis and D.G. Sampson 

a) Precision when measured with PM metric is independent from the maximum 
number of requested learning objects from the Media Space (selection space), as 
well as, from the ranking of the selected learning objects. 

b) Precision when measured with PPM metric is independent from the ranking of the 
selected learning objects, but depends on the volume of the selection space. 

c) The PPM metric tends to be equal to the PM metric when the selection space be- 
comes bigger (n increases). 

d) Performance evaluation using the PM metric is higher or equal to the performance 
when using the PPM metric. Also performance evaluation using the PM metric is 
higher or equal to the performance when using the SS metric. 

e) The SS metric tends to be lower as the searching space increases, whereas PPM 
metric becomes higher as the searching space increases. This is due to the fact 
that, when the searching space increases the probability of introducing ranking er- 
rors also increases. Since the PPM metric is not dependent by the ranking of the 
selected learning objects, the PPM metric behaves differently from the SS metric. 

The same observations apply also when measuring the generalization capacity, as 
depicted in Figure 3 (right column). These observations verify the hypothesis that by 
definition the SS metric is harder than the PM or the PPM metric, which means that in 
the case of AEHS, where the ranking of the selected learning objects is critical, the SS 
metric should be used. 



6 Conclusions 

In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework suitable for validating the per- 
formance decision-based approaches in adaptive learning objects selection in AEHS 
and demonstrate the use of this framework in the case of our proposed decision-based 
approach for estimating the desired AEHS response. More precisely, we discussed the 
limitations of the performance metrics used by the literature for the problem of adap- 
tive content selection, introduced the need for an alternative evaluation metric and 
presented a metric, which although seems similar to the precision metric in informa- 
tion retrieval systems, its difference is critical. This metric evaluates the precision of 
selecting learning objects not on the entire space of the Media Space, but only on the 
desired sub-space, and also it takes into consideration the ranking of the selection 
process.

AFOL: Towards a New Intelligent Interactive 
Programming Language for Children

Abstract. This paper introduces a new programming language for children 
named AFOL. The creation of the AFOL programming language has been 
based on the idea of the well-known Logo programming language. However, 
AFOL extends Logo's basic programming concepts such as sequential and 
functional programming by introducing the more modern concepts of Object 
Oriented programming. Furthermore, AFOL incorporates highly sophisticated 
user interaction mechanisms, namely affective interaction through emotion rec- 
ognition and through the use of animated tutoring agents. In this way, the inter- 
action of children is more user-friendly and constructive since children learn 
programming and have fun at the same time. 



1 Introduction 

The well-known "Logo" programming language was introduced in 1967 ( Frazier, 
1967). The Logo developers' main objective was to take the best practices and ideas 
from computer science and computer programming and produce an interface that was 
good and suitable for the education of young children. Hence, the authors of Logo 
aimed to create a friendly programming language for the education of children where 
they could learn programming by playing with words and sentences. The first 
implementation of Logo was written in LISP for the purposes of creating a 
programming language as a math land where kids could play by giving commands 
that produced nice and colorful drawings. Logo programming language may be seen 
as a compromise between a sequential programming language with block structures, 
and a functional programming language. Logo has been used mainly in the past as a 
teaching language for children but its list handling facilities made it remarkably useful 
for producing useful scripts. A detailed study on the "Logo" programming language 
from its early stages and also recent work on Logo-derived languages and learning 
applications can be found in (Feurzeig, 2010). 

Modern programming languages try to provide as much user-friendliness as possi- 
ble while retaining their full programming functionality. Hudlicka (Hudlicka, 2003) 
points out that an unprecedented growth in human-computer interaction has led to a 
redefinition of requirements for effective user interfaces and that a key component of 
these requirements is the ability of systems to address affect. Learning a programming 
language is a complex cognitive process and it is argued that how people feel may 
play an important role on their cognitive processes as well (Goleman, 1981). At the

same time, many researchers acknowledge that affect has been overlooked by the 
computer community in general (Picard and Klein, 2002). A remedy in the problem of 
effectively teaching children through educational applications may lie in rendering 
computer assisted e-learning systems more human-like and thus more affective. To 
this end, the incorporation of emotion recognition components as well as the incorpo- 
ration of animated tutoring agents in the user interface of the educational application 
can be quite useful and profitable (Elliott et al., 1999). Indeed, the presence of ani- 
mated, speaking agents has been considered beneficial for educational software 
(Johnson et. al, 2000, Lester et. al., 1997). 

In the past, the author of this paper has participated in the development of proto- 
type systems that incorporate emotion recognition modules, based on artificial intelli- 
gence techniques and multi-attribute decision making approaches (Alepis et al. 2009, 
Alepis et al. 2010). The resulting systems showed significant efficiency in recogniz- 
ing and reproducing emotions. 

After a thorough investigation in the related scientific literature we found that there 
is a shortage of educational systems that incorporate multi-modal emotion recogni- 
tion, while we did not find any existing programming languages that incorporate emo- 
tion recognition and/or emotion generation modules. Perhaps the most relevant work 
is that of Kahn (Kahn, 1996), where an animated programming environment for chil- 
dren is described. The author of this paper has developed a programming interface 
called ToonTalk in which the source code is animated and the programming environ- 
ment is a video game. The aim of this project was to give children the opportunity to 
build real programs in a manner that was easy to learn and fun to do. However, this 
approach did not incorporate any affective interaction capabilities. 

In view of the above, this paper presents a new programming language for chil- 
dren, which is highly interactive and intelligent since it provides affective interaction 
during programming. The programming language is called AFOL which is the acro- 
nym for "Affective Object Oriented Logo Language". In the implementation of the 
AFOL language there is an added programming dimension that of object oriented 
programming (Pastor et al., 2001, Alepis & Virvou, 2011). Through the language's 
object-oriented architecture, an AFOL program may thus be viewed as a collection of 
interacting objects, as opposed to the conventional Logo model, in which a program is 
seen as a list of tasks. Furthermore, the initial goal to create a programming language 
suitable for the needs and the limitations of children is further improved through the 
AFOL language, by a highly user-friendly user interface, designed for affective 
interaction between computers and children. The incorporation of emotion 
recognition capabilities, as well as the presence of speaking animated emotional 
tutoring agents both introduce a novelty in the area of computer assisted programming 
language learning. 



2 General Architecture of the AFOL Programming Environment 

In this section, we describe the overall functionality and emotion recognition features 
of AFOL. The architecture of AFOL consists of the main educational programming 
environment, a user monitoring component, emotion recognition inference mecha- 
nisms and a database. Part of the database is used to store data related to the 



AFOL: Towards a New Intelligent Interactive Programming Language for Children

programming language. Another part of the database is used to store and handle 
affective interaction related data.. The programming environment's architecture is 
illustrated in figure 1 .

As we can see in figure 1, the students' interaction can be accomplished either 
orally through the microphone, or through the keyboard/mouse modality. The 
educational systems consists of three subsystems, namely the affective interaction 
subsystem, the programming language's compiler subsystem and the subsystem that 
reasons for and handles the animated agent's behaviour.

3 Overview of the AFOL Programming Learning System 

While using the educational application from a desktop computer, children as students 
have the oportunity of being taught particular programming courses. The information 
is given in text form while at the same time an animated agent reads it out loud using 
a speech engine. Students are prompted to write programming commands and also 
programs in the AFOL language in order to produce drawings, shapes and particular 
objects. The main application is installed either on a public computer where all stu- 
dents have access, or alternatively each student may have a copy on his/her own 
personal computer. Two examples of using the AFOL's programming interface are 
illustrated in figures 2 and 3. The animated agent is present in these modes to make 
the interaction more human-like. The tutoring agent would also try to sympathise with 
the aims of each user as student and would try to elicit human emotions. 

Figure 1 illustrates a snapshot from user interaction where a user is typing pro- 
gramming commands that contain pre-stored objects in order to produce a compli- 
cated drawing. In figure 2 we can see a tutoring character that congratulates a user for 
producing a quite complicated drawing by using the programming languages com- 
mands and object oriented features. While the users interact with the affective system, 
both their oral and keyboard actions are recorded in order to be interpreted in

is beyond the scopes of this paper that aims basically in the presentation of the new 
programming environment. However, the overall functionality of these modules 
which lead to multi-modal recognition of emotions through multimodal data, can be 
found in (Tsihrintzis et al. 2008) and in (Alepis & Virvou, 2006). The results from 
these studies were quite promising and encouraged as to test this approach to a more 
demanding domain that belongs to the area of teaching programming to young 
children. 



4 AFOL Language Commands and Object Oriented Structure 



In this section we give an overview of the AFOL system's supported programming 
commands, as well as the functionality that derives from the language's Object Ori- 
ented perspective. In the implementation of the AFOL system we have used the 
Logo's well-known feature which is the turtle. The turtle is an on-screen cursor, which 
can be given movement and drawing instructions, and is used to programmatically 
produce line graphics and colored shapes. Programming code snippets that produce 
drawing objects can be saved and stored as Objects of the AFOL system. Stored 



204 E. Alepis 

objects can be reloaded and used within the programming language as existing pieces 
of programming code. Tables 1 and 2 show the AFOL's class structure and the pro- 
gramming language's commands respectively. 

Table 1. AFOL language class attributes and operations 



Class Attributes 


Attribute 


Description 


Color 


This attribute assigns a color value to 
the specified Object. The color value can 
be used by the "drawing" and the "filling" 
commands. 


Penwidth 


This attribute assigns a penwidth 
(width of pen) value to the specified Ob- 
ject. The width of the pen value can be 
used by the "drawing" commands. 


Class Operations 


Operation 


Description 


Reduce 


This operation is used to reduce the 
size of a specified Object by a user speci- 
fied percentage. Affects all forward and 
backward turtle drawing movements. 


Expand 


This operation is used to expand the 
size of a specified Object by a user speci- 
fied percentage. Affects all forward and 
backward turtle drawing movements. 


Fliphorizontal 


This operation is used to flip horizon- 
tally a specified Object. Affects all right 
and left turning commands. 


Flipvertical 


This operation is used to flip vertically 
a specified Object. Affects all right and 
left turning commands. 


Rotate 


This operation is used to draw a speci- 
fied Object rotated clockwise by a user 
specified angle. Affects the turtle's initial 
angle. 


Save 


This operation is used to save a speci- 
fied Object in the system's database. 



Table 1 illustrates a list of attributes and operations that can be used within the Ob- 
ject Oriented structure of the AFOL language. Each existing object can be called by 
its name in the system's command-line interface. Correspondingly, each specified 
object has a number of attributes and operations that can take values or can be called 
on run time by the users. Both the attributes and the operations constitute each objects 
characteristics and functionalities and are members of a general template class. In 
accordance with the implementation of the AFOL language, if an object consists of 



AFOL: Towards a New Intelligent Interactive Programming Language for Children 205 

other objects (for example a drawn house may contain drawn windows and doors), 
then these sub-objects also inherit the super-object's characteristics. However, all 
inherited characteristics are the default values for each sub-object and these values 
can be changed in each sub-object's own implementation. 

At this point we may remark that each object's attributes provide an alternative 
way of assigning values while drawing in the AFOL's interface. For example by writ- 
ing "TomHouse. color clred" we command the AFOL's turtle to use the red color 
when drawing the "TomHouse" object. This can also be achieved by assigning the red 
color as the value of the turtle's current drawing pen before drawing the specified 
object. However, each object's operations have a more complicated structure and it 
would be quite difficult to provide an alternative way for their implementation rather 
than their calls through the existing objects. As an example, if we wanted to reduce 
the size of a specified object, the reduce call would easily do that ("newobject.reduce 
50", which means that the new object will have 50% of the size of the initial object), 
while a user would have to change a big number of commands in the object's imple- 
mentation in order to have the same effect. As a result, the 00 structure within the 
AFOL's commands not only provides a better, logical structure for the existing pro- 
gramming language, but also offers more functionality to the users.

Example 


Fd value 


This command is used to move the turtle 
forward by a specified by the "value" variable 
range (move forward).

Bd value 


This command is used to move the turtle 
backward by a specified by the "value" vari- 
able range (move backward). 


Bd80 


Rt value 


This command is used to rotate the turtle 
clockwise by a specified by the "value" vari- 
able range (turn right). 


Rt45 


Lt value 


This command is used to rotate the turtle 
counterclockwise by a specified by the 
"value" variable range (turn left).

variable 


This command is used to change the turtle's 
current drawing color to the specified by the 
"colorvariable" variable color.

Pen Width value 


This command is used to change the turtle's 
current drawing pen width to the specified by 
the "value" variable value. 


PenWidth 5 


Pu 


This command is used to hold the turtle's 
pen up, so that the turtle can move without 
leaving any trace (pen up). 


Pu 



206 E. Alepis 



Table 2. (continued) 



Pd 


This command is used to restore the turtle's 
pen down (after a pu command), so that the 
turtle can move leaving its trace (pen down). 


Pd 


Refresh 


This command is used to refresh/clear the 
drawing area. 


Refresh 


Home 


This command is used to move the turtle to 
a default position in the center of the drawing 
area. 


Home 


New Object 


This command is used when creating a new 
Object. The new Object inherits its functional- 
ity by a pre-stored to the system's database 
Object. 


New House 
TomHouse 


Run Object 


This command is used to run the program- 
ming code of a specified pre-loaded Object. 


Run TomHouse 


Repeat value 


This command is used to specify the begin- 
ning of a loop. Each loop contains commands 
and is repeated by a number of repetitions 
specified by the "value" variable. 


Repeat 4 
Fd50 
Rt90 
Endrpt 


Endrpt 


This command is used to indicate the end 
of a "repeat" loop. 



Table 2 shows a listing of the AFOL programming language interface commands, 
as well as an example of programming code for each command. In the AFOL's GUI 
the turtle moves with commands that are relative to its own position, for example Rt 
90 means rotate right by 90 degrees. Students who use the AFOL system would easily 
understand (and predict and reason about) the turtle's motion by imagining what they 
would do if they were the turtle. Some commands produce a drawing effect while the 
turtle moves on the system's screen, while other commands are used to handle objects 
and to refresh the drawing area. Furthermore, some commands affect the turtle's 
available pen that is used for drawing a trace when the turtle moves. Finally, the "re- 
peat" command is used to include a sequence of commands that is executed repeat- 
edly for a specified number of times. 

5 Conclusions 



In this paper, we presented a new programming language that has been implemented 
for the needs of teaching programming skills to young children. The resulting sophisti- 
cated programming environment is called AFOL. AFOL reflects its author's attempt to 
preserve well-known past approaches towards the education of children in the area of 
programming, while at the same time enrich the language's architecture with modern 
architectures and approaches and also provide a highly attractive interface for young 
children. The "older" Logo programming language has been used as a foretype for the 
resulting system which has been extended by the incorporation of the wide spread 



AFOL: Towards a New Intelligent Interactive Programming Language for Children 207 

model of object oriented programming. The programming language's environment is 
also very user friendly since it includes affective interaction components, namely bi- 
modal emotion recognition and emotion elicitation through interactive tutoring agents 
that participate in the whole educational process. 

It is in our future plans to evaluate the AFOL system as an educational tool and as 
programming environment in order to examine the degree of its usefulness as an edu- 
cational tool for the teachers, as well as the degree of usefulness and user-friendliness 
for the young children as students who are going to use the system. Moreover, a fu- 
ture evaluation study is expected to reveal specific affective characteristics of the e- 
learning environment that may influence the children in becoming more effective 
students and more satisfied users.

Abstract. Evolution of communication networks envisages providing mobile 
users with seamless Quality of Service (QoS) support. This paper presents a ses- 
sion reconfiguration approach that dynamically manages QoS for multimedia ser- 
vices in response to session mobility and terminal mobility. It considers changes 
(referred to as events) that are induced by mobility and utilizes those affecting 
QoS to steer the session reconfiguration. As the result, basic operations, called 
reconfiguration primitives, are applied to maintain or adapt QoS. Use cases that 
illustrate motivation for this work are described, along with the proposed func- 
tional model. An initial performance evaluation of the model is also outlined. 

1 Introduction 

The need to deliver multimedia services "any where-anytime" has largely increased over 
the last ten years 1 3 ] . This highlights one of the key requirements envisaged by the evo- 
lution of communication networks - providing mobile users with seamless Quality of 
Service (QoS) support for multimedia services. Such a support must consider various 
mobility aspects. In this work, we focus on two aspects. First aspect, referred to as ses- 
sion mobility, allows a user to continue communication when replacing her terminals, 
while the second aspect, i.e. terminal mobility, enables a user terminal to maintain com- 
munication while changing its network attachment point. In order to achieve an adap- 
tive QoS management, the support must regard variable mobility-induced constraints 
111215 1, thus achieving a form of mobility-awareness. 

Mobility-aware QoS support described in literature mainly focuses on applying 
transport/network-level operations that consider individual mobility aspects and "con- 
ventional" mobility-induced changes. The Trigger Management Framework [4] handles 
notifications caused by conventional changes, e.g. based on received signal strength in- 
dications and network load, but also by "higher-level" changes, such as end-to-end QoS 
degradation. The Multi-User Session Control solution [2| provides mobile users with 
access to sessions, while supporting QoS adaptation against terminal mobility. This 
approach is centered around a transport/network-level signaling between the specified 
entities and the adaptation in terms of assigning different QoS classes to session flows 
or adding/dropping flows from a session. 

A service delivery framework for multimedia applications described in HI is adapt- 
able to terminal and session mobility, which includes customizing session parameters

to bandwidth of access networks and encodings/formats supported by user terminals, 
but does not involve QoS negotiation and network resource reservation. A solution that 
provides session continuity between different access networks is presented in [5]. It en- 
ables transfer of agreed QoS parameters across the access networks, but assumes that 
the QoS settings stay the same after the change. 

The work presented in this paper complements the current research efforts and 
presents a session reconfiguration approach that dynamically manages QoS for mul- 
timedia services in response to mobility. It employs the application level, which of- 
fers independence of an access technology or a service scenario, and ability to make 
application-dependentdecisions. The approach considers changes (referred to as events) 
that stem from session and terminal mobility, and utilizes those affecting QoS to steer 
the reconfiguration. As the result, basic operations, called reconfiguration primitives, 
are applied to maintain or adapt QoS. The latter involves interacting with control enti- 
ties that reserve network resources to assign the required allocation. 

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define the mo- 
bility events and reconfiguration primitives, and describe use cases that illustrate ap- 
plication of the approach. The proposed functional model is presented in Section 3, 
with the emphasis on necessary functional entities, and on the signaling that facilitates 
event notification and session reconfiguration. Section 4 depicts an initial performance 
evaluation of the model. We then conclude the paper. 

2 Session Reconfiguration and Use Cases 

For the purposes of this work, we define a multimedia session as a collection of media 
flows within a group of participants. Media flow is a stream of media data (e.g., audio 
or video), to which these parameters are assigned: identifiers of participants between 
which the flow is established, chosen media format and encoding, and a QoS specifica- 
tion defining required network bandwidth, delay, delay variation, and packet loss ratio. 
Session participant relates either to a user terminal, which enables a user to engage in 
the session, or a server, which acts as a media source. 

Mobility Events and Reconfiguration Primitives 

Session mobility may lead to heterogeneous terminals being used for accessing the ser- 
vices, while terminal mobility may result in changes to network connectivity and access 
technology. Using a concept of representing changes with events, similar to that pro- 
posed in [4], we identify changes induced by the mobility and model them as mobility 
events (illustrated in FigureQ} to be considered by the reconfiguration: 

1 . Change of terminal - represents a change of the user terminal due to session mo- 
bility; 

2. Change of location - represents a change in user terminal's location due to terminal 
mobility; and 

3. Change of access network - represents a change of access network (i.e., underlying 
access technology) for the user terminal due to terminal mobility. 

The goal of the session reconfiguration is to modify the elements of a session in or- 
der to maintain or adapt QoS. It introduces three reconfiguration primitives: (a) start

media flow, (b) stop media flow, and (c) modify media flow. Starting a media flow in- 
cludes several steps. First, the associated session participants need to agree upon a QoS 
specification for the considered flow, after which the allocation of required network re- 
sources is invoked. Finally, the participants set up media transceivers with the agreed 
format/encoding and transport parameters, and start the flow. On the other hand, when 
participants reach a decision to stop a flow, the reserved resources are released and the 
corresponding media transceivers suspended. Modifying a media flow refers to chang- 
ing its format/encoding and QoS specification, which leads to adjusting the allocation 
of the resources for the flow. 

Use Cases 

Each of the use cases, which illustrate motivation for and application of the approach, 

is associated to an introduced mobility event. 

1) Use case for Change of terminal 

Maria establishes a video conference with an associate while traveling to work. She 
uses her smartphone to go over the materials for a meeting. Once at work, she goes to a 
room with a high-definition plasma screen. Maria decides to transfer the video flow of 
the conference to the plasma screen and to leave the audio flow on the phone. Prior to the 
flow transfer, new flow parameters (with a QoS specification) are produced regarding 
the hardware and software features of the targeted terminal. The reconfiguration applies 
start media flow to initiate video flow to the screen and stop media flow for the same 
flow on the phone. 

2) Use case for Change of location 

After boarding a train, Sofia establishes a QoS-supported session with a "local" game 
server and starts playing. The session involves several media and data flows. As the 
train travels to the destination, Sofia's laptop computer changes location and network 
attachment point, which leads to seamless reconnection to another game server instance, 
to maintain QoS. The session flows are transferred by invoking start media flow and 



212 O. Dobrijevic and M. Matijasevic 

stop media flow, but the applied QoS specifications are kept. Prior to the transfer, flow 
parameters are updated to match the new server instance. 
3) Use case for Change of access network 

While going home by a subway, Zoe is playing a multi-player game on her smart- 
phone, which supports several access technologies. The only available access at the 
time is UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System). After a while, a HSPA 
(High Speed Packet Access) network comes to reach. Since Zoe's preferences state that 
HSPA is preferred, due to a higher bandwidth and improved QoS, her phone changes 
the access. Then, modify media flow is applied to produce new flow parameters (with 
QoS specifications) and reserve resources in the new network. 

3 Functional Model 

In order to achieve a mobility-aware QoS management at the application level, the 
presented approach encompasses several functional aspects: 

- session-level signaling for negotiation and dynamic renegotiation of the flow pa- 
rameters (notably, QoS specifications), in particular due to the mobility events; 

- producing QoS specifications for media flows within a multimedia session; 

- interacting with control entities that reserve access network resources; and 

- generating and conveying the mobility event notifications, as well as deciding upon 
the reconfiguration primitives to apply in response. 

Identified functional model (Figure comprises generic control entities that provide 
the given aspects. User Terminal Entity (UTE) represents a session participant used for 
accessing multimedia services. Each UTE is described with a hardware and software 
configuration, including supported access technologies, which is stored in a user pro- 
file at User Profile Repository Entity. The user profile holds a "knowledge" about the 
user in terms of her preferences and the available terminals. UTE contains these func- 
tions: Session control function (SCF), Event analysis function (EAF), QoS monitoring 
function (QSMF), and Media transmission function (MTF). 

EAF processes User inputs and produces the Change of terminal notifications. SCF 
is then invoked to signal the notifications to Session Configuration Management-Support 
Entity (SCM-SE), which decides about the reconfiguration. SCF also performs signal- 
ing for session establishment and QoS (re)negotiation. When the media flow parameters 
are agreed, SCF invokes MTF to set up and start, modify, or stop media delivery. QSMF 
measures actual QoS performance for a media flow. 

Mediating Session Control Entity (MSCE) is a signaling proxy for each UTE that 
wants to establish the sessions. It forwards session control messages between UTEs 
and the chosen Serving Session Control Entity (SSCE), and invokes the allocation of 
access network resources by interacting with Resource and Admission Control Entities 
(RACEs). MSCE extracts required flow parameters from the control messages and con- 
veys them to RACEs. SSCE is the central signaling proxy, which forwards the control 
messages between session participants. SSCE includes, e.g., SCM-SE in the signaling 
path, thus invoking functions that SCM-SE provides.

Multimedia Application and Content-Support Entity (MAC-SE) is a session partic- 
ipant, which refers to a server that executes multimedia applications and hosts media 
content. Each application is described with its requirements and constraints, which are 
stored in a service profile at Service Profile Repository Entity. The service profile rep- 
resents a "knowledge" about a multimedia service that the application offers. MAC-SE 
also incorporates SCF and MTF. Similarly to UTE, SCF handles session control mes- 
sages, but MAC-SE exchanges them directly with the chosen SSCE. SCF invokes MTF 
to control media delivery (e.g., streaming). 

SCM-SE is the key QoS management component, which includes the QoS match- 
ing and optimization function (QMOF) [6| and Session reconfiguration function (SRF). 
QMOF produces QoS specifications based on information obtained from considered 
user and service profiles. An event notification signaled to SCM-SE is delivered to SRF, 
which analyzes the change and decides about the primitive(s) to be applied. SCM-SE 
includes SCF to exchange session control messages with the given SSCE, allowing it 
to engage in QoS negotiation and receive the notifications. 

RACEs authorize and allocate resources in access networks, and include Policy De- 
cision Entity (PDE) and Policy Enforcement Entity (PEE). While PDE makes decisions 
regarding authorization, reservation and release of the resources, PEE imposes the deci- 
sions. Access Configuration Provision Entities provide information about UTE's access 
network and location, including a unique identifier of the network, thus notifying for 
Change of location and Change of access network.

Signaling Procedures 

This QoS management approach defines five signaling procedures. Media flow estab- 
lishment specifies signaling that establishes one or more media flows, while Media flow 
termination relates to stopping the flows and releasing the allocated resources. The three 
remaining procedures define signaling in response to the corresponding events, and the 
Change of user terminal procedure is described in details. 

1) The Media flow establishment signaling 

This procedure creates an association of two participants for exchanging media flows, 
during which capabilities and demands of the participants are matched, and the flow 
parameters are agreed upon. Figure [3] depicts the Unified Modeling Language (UML) 
sequence diagram that specifies the procedure. It illustrates the flow establishment be- 
tween a UTE and a MAC-SE. For a clearer presentation, the User and Service Profile 
Repository Entities are merged into the Profile Repository Entity. 

Signaling is invoked when a user decides to access a multimedia service, which leads 
to establishing a session between user's UTE and the hosting MAC-SE. After the UTE 
sends a session request message to the MAC-SE (Figure [3] step 1), it traverses the 
UTE's MSCE and the given SSCE, which acquires the needed user profile, authorizes 
the user, and retrieves service profile for the requested service. Then, the MAC-SE ac- 
cepts the request {session response is sent to the UTE), which triggers the SSCE to 
invoke the SCM-SE (step 10). The QMOF produces a. feasible service profile by match- 
ing parameters from the given profiles. The feasible profile contains flow parameters 
that both the UTE and the MAC-SE support. It offers a set of media formats/encodings 
for each flow, with the associated QoS specifications. 

The feasible service profile, which is referred to as an offer, is then sent to the MSCE 
to invoke authorization of the resources. The procedure continues at the UTE (step 17), 
where the user can accept, modify or deny (a subset of) parameters from the feasi- 
ble profile (e.g., she can choose which media flows are to be established). The chosen 
parameters form & feasible service profile answer (step 18), which is conveyed to the 
MAC-SE and, then, to the SCM-SE. The QMOF performs the optimization (step 23), 
to determine an optimal usage of the resources that are needed for providing the cho- 
sen QoS specifications. The resulting optimized service profile is used by the PDE/PEE 
to allocate the resources (steps 26 and 27). As there are multiple combinations of the 
formats/encodings and QoS specifications which can be applied, the PDE decides of 
the reservation considering current resource availability. The optimized profile is then 
sent to the UTE and the MAC-SE, to set up their media transceivers with the selected 
parameters and to initiate media flow(s). 

2) The Change of user terminal signaling 

Change of user terminal enables transfer of one or more media flows between ses- 
sion participants, without breaking the established communication. The procedure is 
depicted by the UML sequence diagram shown in Figure [4] 

It illustrates signaling between three UTEs, assuming that media flows are estab- 
lished between UTE1 and UTE2, and that a user wants to transfer the flows from UTE1 
to UTE3, which are both assisted by the same MSCE. The reconfiguration first estab- 
lishes the flows between UTE3 and UTE2, and then terminates the corresponding flows

between UTE1 and UTE2. For a clearer presentation, a MSCE and a PDE/PEE support- 
ing UTE2 are omitted from the sequence diagram, as is the Profile Repository Entity. 

Signaling is invoked when a user decides to replace her terminal (referred to as 
UTE1) in an ongoing session and identifies another terminal (UTE3) as the transfer 
target. User's request results in the associated Change of terminal notification being 
produced, which UTE1 sends as a media flow transfer request message to UTE3 (Fig- 
ure[4] steps 1-4). This message contains identifier of the correspondent UTE (referred 
to as UTE2). After the request is accepted by UTE3 (steps 5-8), it sends an add UTE to 
session message to UTE2. 



Multimedia Session Reconfiguration for Mobility-Aware QoS Management 217 

When UTE2 accepts this "join request" from UTE3, the procedure continues sim- 
ilarly as for Media flow establishment: the SRF and the QMOF produce the feasible 
and optimized service profiles for UTE3, which are used for reserving the network re- 
sources, and the media transmission is initiated towards UTE3 (thus adding the latter 
to the session). Afterwards, UTE3 initiates removal of UTE1 from the session (steps 
41-44), which prompts UTE1 to end its participation (steps 49-56). Before the removal 
of UTE1, the resources allocated to it are released (steps 54-55). 

4 Performance Evaluation 

The proposed functional model is formally defined by using Discrete Event System 
Specification (DEVS) [7|. DEVS is a formal framework for simulation of general dis- 
crete event systems, which offers atomic DEVS models to capture systems' behavior and 
coupled DEVS models to build their structure. Each proposed model entity is realized 
as an atomic DEVS (aDEVS), while the associated signaling messages are "mapped" to 
input and output events of the aDEVS. Defined aDEVS models are integrated by using 
coupled DEVS. The definition is the basis for an implementation and simulation of the 
proposed model in the DEVS-Suite Simulator |8|. 

An initial performance evaluation of the model is conducted to assess its scalability. 
It introduces the duration metric, which is measured in relation to the number of UTEs 
that simultaneously execute a particular signaling procedure. Each procedure defines 
duration as the interval to exchange all the messages (e.g., for Media flow establish- 
ment, this is the interval between 1. session request and 36. start media flows), with its 
reference value implying single procedure execution. As the proposed model is generic, 
these values may be set as seen fit. For this evaluation, the values for Media flow estab- 
lishment and Change of user terminal are set to 14.0 and 25.5 "time units" (with regards 
to message number ratio between these procedures). The results (Table[T} indicate that 
average duration for the analyzed procedures increases almost linearly with the number 
of UTEs, thus offering a good scalability.

5 Conclusions and Future Work 



This paper presents use cases and a proposed functional model of mobility-aware QoS 
management for multimedia services. The approach employs session reconfiguration at 



218 O. Dobrijevic and M. Matijasevic 

the application level to maintain or adapt QoS dynamically, and independently of an 
access type or a service scenario. Generic mobility events and the applicable recon- 
figuration operations are defined. We illustrate model application in the signaling pro- 
cedure for managing QoS against session mobility, while initial evaluation indicates a 
good scalability to number of the participants. Future work includes an extensive model 
evaluation and application in a real-network prototype.

Abstract. People have always been using several techniques in order 
to protect their privacy. For centuries, steganography has been used, 
but only in the last decades the proper mathematical background has 
been developed. Due technological advances, steganography has found 
many applications, with most important the protection of digital assets 
through DRM. 

This work proposes a new detection method of steganographic con- 
tent through compressive sensing. The proposed method is a probabilis- 
tic filter that can detect steganographic content in images with increased 
probability, if this is made with the LSB method, after applying a filter 
with compressive sensing technique. 

Keywords: Steganography, compressive sensing, steganalysis. 



1 Introduction 

Our constantly increasing needs for communication through Internet and mo- 
bile telecommunications have also increased our need for privacy. The two main 
methods for protecting our data is cryptography and steganography.The former 
tries to hide the contents of our data, while the latter tries to hide their very 
own existence. In practice, we never use steganography on its own, we use cryp- 
tography as well as another layer of security, in order to protect our data in case 
the existence of the content becomes known. 

The two most widely used techniques in images are LSB and frequency do- 
main. The first method is based on embedding the data in the least significant 
bits of the medium, something that introduces some distortions in the picture. 
These however which may be untraceable, if the pixels used are properly se- 
lected. The other methods take the waveform of the image and embed the data 
in its DCT or DWT form, by quantizing the coefficients. 

In our work we make use of compressive sensing algorithms, specially BM3D 
algorithm. The core idea of compressive sensing is that if a signal is sparse 
then it can be described by a smaller basis, while containing most of the useful 
information. The idea was introduced in 2004 by Donoho (5]and was extended 
later by Candes, Romberg and Tao[14j. 

The current work presents a new algorithm that tries to detect LSB stegano- 
graphic embedding of data in images by the use of compressive sensing

algorithms. The algorithm that has been used is bm3d, but as it will become 
apparent, others can be used, possibly with better results. 

2 Steganalysis 

Steganalysis is the opposite of steganography, it is the methods that are used 
in order to detect embedded content in a medium. Depending on the knowledge 
that we have about the steganographic system and regardless of the medium 
that is used as a stego-object, the steganalysis techniques can be categorized to 
the following main three groups: 

Blind identification. In this group, we do not have any knowledge of the 
steganographic system and we try to detect steganographic data based solely on 
statistical properties of the medium. 

Parametric statistical steganalysis. In some cases we may know that the 
used steganographic system changes some properties of the medium with specific 
patterns on some of its properties. The techniques of this group try to detect 
the existence of steganographic data by detecting these patterns. 

Supervised learning based steganalysis. These techniques use statistical 
classifiers to see whether the tested image is a stego image. In this group we 
have a set of known clean set of object and one of stego-object. These sets are 
used for training our algorithm to detect whether a medium is stego-object or 
not. 

Since the focus of this work is on image steganalysis and specially on LSB 
hiding, we will point out some already used methods. One of the first methods 
used was x 2 method [6], where we examine whether the tested image's histogram 
is close to the histogram of the same image with embedded data. 

Fridrich, Goljan and Du [7] proposed in 2001 the RS (Regular/Singular) 
scheme. Their approach counts the number of occurrences of pairs in sets. The 
idea is that spatially adjacent image pixels, which are highly correlated, can 
give us a lot of information whether LSB has been applied in the examined im- 
age, meaning that if LSB has been applied then areas where embedding has been 
made then adjacent image pixels would appear to have many different properties 
compared to where no tampering has been made. 

Related sample pair analysis [SJ is another steganalysis method for detecting 
LSB data hiding in images. In this approach we take sample pairs of values 
and we divide them into subsets depending on the relation of the two values 
to one another. This technique makes the assumption that if it is not a stego 
image, then the number of pairs in each subset are almost equal and that LSB 
embedding is quantizing the subsets by changing their numbers, something that 
can be easily detected. 

For more an introduction to general steganalysis techniques one may refer to 
[TJ [5] and for more advanced techniques and extensions of the above to [HI fTUl

LSB Steganographic Detection Using Compressive Sensing 221 

3 Compressive Sensing and BM3D 

Compressive sensing, also known as compressed sensing and compressive sam- 
pling is a method to reconstruct a signal. This method is used by several scien- 
tific fields in Information technology. Donoho first and then Candes, Romberg 
and Tao devised a method to reconstruct an image from an amount of data 
much less from the number of data that would be deemed sufficient by the 
Nyquist Shannon sampling theorem [13J. Their approach was that in many cases 
the signals are sparse, hence using another smaller basis we might be able to re- 
cover the most usefull part of the signal by using a smaller sample. Several 
applications of these algoriths have so far been made, raging from MM recon- 
struction to coding theory.

An algorithm that belongs to this family of compressive sampling is the BM3D 
technique, that we use in our work. In this method, a group of image blocks 
is created around to a selected block. Filtering takes place in blocks grouped 
in 3d arrays. This is considered to give spatial adaptively to the algorithm. 
Filtered blocks are then ungrouped and returned to their original coordinates. 
This method of collaborative filtering preserves local details in the image and 
achieves high quality denoising. BM3D method's effectiveness does not depend 
on image weights calculation, which is computationally expensive, rather it is 
based on the similarities between groups of image parts, which is consider to 
be more efficient. The BM3D algorithm by Kostadin Dabov, Alessandro Foi, 
Vladimir Katkovnik, and Karen Egiazarian is implemented in two steps, the basic 
estimate and the final estimate. A draft outline of the algorithm is presented in 
Figure [TJ 



4 The Proposed Method 

The main idea of our proposal is to regard each image to be examined as an 
image with embedded noise. The noise our image has, the more the image is 
probable to have LSB embedded information. The question that is raised now is 
what we mean with a lot of noise, and how do we measure it? 

As discussed above, compressive sampling is a method for reconstructing our 
signals, taking a small sample of it. The assumption that we make is that if 
the image has no LSB embedding, then the reconstruction with a compressive 
sampling will be more close to the original, than to one stego-image. The reason 
for making this assumption is that when parsing an image from a compressive 
sampling algorithm, if it has LSB data embedded, then the algorithm will not 
perform as well, because it has extra noise to remove. 

The method now is very straight forward, firstly we select a compressive 
sampling algorithm, in our case BM3D. Afterwards we take the image I to be 



(a) Original 



(b) Stego-image 



(c) BM3D processed

examined and parse it to BM3D to recover image F. We then compare the dif- 
ferences of images I and I' in pixel colors. 

5 Results 

In order to test our method, we made several tests using Matlab and a set of 
classic test images for image processing. In our tests we took each picture I, 
created a stego-image out of it, with LSB and we processed both images using 
BM3D. We then took each processed picture and compared it to the original 
one, keeping their percent color difference. The results can be seen in Tables [1] 
andd 

For parameter sigma equal to 1 it becomes apparent that we have a big dif- 
ference between "clean" images and stego images. The results are more clear for 
sigma equal to 2, where we can have an obvious criterion for LSB stego images, 
which is 40%.

6 Conclusions 



The proposed method performs with extremely good percentages in finding 
stego-images, with minimal false-positives and true-negatives, setting specific 
bounds on when an image should be regarded as a stego-image. The applied 
filter is very quick and does not need any special hardware installed. One draw- 
back of the method as presented here is that BM3D is an algorithm for grayscale 
images, yet this can be easily circumvented by parsing each color layer on its 
own and detecting LSB existence on each one.

LSB Steganographic Detection Using Compressive Sensing 225 

It is obvious that the method can be applied with other compressive sensing 
algorithms, besides BM3D, possibly with better results. As an extension to the 
method, we will try to test it against DCT and DWT steganographic schemes 
and on other mediums, like audio.

Abstract. Many researches of content-based image retrieval appear in trans- 
form domain. We analyze and enhance a histogram method for image retrieval 
in DCT domain. This approach is based on 4x4 block DCT. After pre- 
processing, AC and DC Patterns are extracted from DCT coefficients. After 
various experiments, we propose to use zig-zag scan with fewer DCT coeffi- 
cients to construct the AC-Pattern. Moreover adjacent patterns are defined by 
observing distances between them and merged in AC-Pattern histogram. Then 
the descriptors are constructed from AC-Pattern and DC-Pattern histograms and 
the combination of these descriptors is used to do image retrieval. Performance 
analysis is done on two common face image databases. Experiments show that 
we can get better performance by using our proposals. 

Keywords: Content-based image retrieval, DCT, zig-zag scan, adjacent pat- 
terns, face recognition. 



1 Introduction 

As the majority of the images are stored in compressed format and most of compres- 
sion technologies adopt transforms to achieve a large amount of compression, image 
retrieval in transform domain has been widely studied in many researches. Comparing 
to traditional approaches of indexing compressed images in which they need to de- 
code the images to the pixel domain first; working directly in transform domain has 
the advantages in time consuming and computational load. Discrete Cosine Transform 
(DCT) is used in JPEG compression standard. In this aspect, DCT is also used as a 
tool to extract features in image retrieval. In last few years, many researches appeared 
in this field. 

The DCT coefficients represent some directional information at different resolu- 
tions, so they can be used directly as texture features [1]. In a block the upper left 
DCT coefficients are categorized into 4 groups: one is DC coefficient and three other 
ones include the coefficients which have vertical, horizontal and diagonal informa- 
tion. In [2], author groups coefficients into several vectors to represent colour and tex- 
ture features. In [3], the statistical information of DCT coefficients is used as texture 
features. In [4], the histogram of DCT patterns is constructed and it is used to do 
retrieval.

Histogram is a typical statistical tool that extracts global information of the whole 
image. In this paper, based on the histogram method presented in [4], we propose to 
use a zig-zag scan with fewer coefficients to construct AC-Pattern. Furthermore, we 
define adjacent patterns by observing distances and merge them in AC-Pattern histo- 
gram. Experiments in GTF [10] and ORL [11] database demonstrate the outperfor- 
mance of our proposal. 

The paper is organized as follows. Descriptions of constructing descriptor and pa- 
rameter analysis are given in section 2 and section 3. Section 4 presents the results of 
experiments and a conclusion is given in section 5.

Images are divided into PxQ blocks and each block is transformed independently 
by 2-D DCT. In this study, we use P = Q = 4 , therefore, 4x4 block DCT transform 
is obtained. 

AC-Pattern is referred as the AC coefficients in one DCT block. The total number 
of AC coefficients in a DCT block is 15, but the number of coefficients that are used 
to construct the AC-Pattern can be adjusted. Time and performance advantages can be 
got by this adjustment. There are two methods of scanning to range the coefficients in 
AC-Pattern. The first way is a row-by-row manner, as used in [4]. We call it linear 
scan. The second way is a zig-zag scan. 

The histogram of AC-Pattern ( H AC ) is defined as numbers of appearance of AC- 
Patterns in the image and use DC-DirecVec histogram [4] as DC-Pattern histogram 
( H DC ). The descriptors are constructed from these two histograms. 



Analysis of Histogram Descriptor for Image Retrieval in DCT Domain 229 

2.1 Pre-processing 

To reduce the impacts of luminance variations, pre-processing steps need to be done 
before constructing the histograms [4]. 

Assume there are N DCT blocks in an image i , and the DC value for each block 
is denoted by DC (i)\ < j < N . From these DC values, we can calculate the mean 
DC values for this image: 

1 N 
DC me Ji) = -Y j DC ] (i) (1) 

Then the average luminance DC â of all images in a database is calculated: 



' allmean 

M 



1 M 

DC â = â Y DC (i) 

allmean . , / j mean v ' 



M <=1 



(2) 



where M denotes the total number of images in the database. Then, the ratio of lumi- 
nance rescaling for image i is calculated: 

DC 

R '-~5c~^) (3) 

Then all the DCT coefficients are normalized with respect to R { by rescaling 
them: 



F i (u,v) = F i (u,v)xR i (4) 

After normalization, the DCT coefficients are quantized by using a quantization 
parameter QP: 



FAu,v) 



FM ' v)= "^r (5) 



2.2 Construction of the AC-Pattern Histogram 

Observed AC-patterns from blocks are numerous. So an objective is the reduction of 
their number. To do this, adjacent patterns will be defined and merged by observing 
distances between coefficients in AC-Patterns i and j . The concept of adjacency is 
defined as follows: 

If |C ; (1) - Cj (1)| < Th or|c ; (2) - Cj (2)| < Th or- â  -or|c,. (tri) - C } (m)\ < Th (6) 

then these two patterns will be classified as adjacent patterns. Where C-(k) and 
C:(k) (l<k<m, m indicates the number of coefficients in AC-Pattern) represent 
AC coefficients. Th is the threshold. In our proposal, Th = \.

To merge the adjacent patterns, we arrange the bins in adjacent order firstly and 
then merge the adjacent patterns by histogram equalization. Furthermore, there is one 
special AC-Pattern in which all the AC-coefficients are zero. We exclude this pattern 
from the AC-Pattern histogram. 

2.3 Construction of DC-Pattern Histogram 

We use DC-DirecVec histogram [4] as DC-Pattern histogram. As shown in Fig. 2, 
nine differences between DC coefficients of the current block and its 8 neighbours are 
calculated. The difference of direction 9 is the difference between current DC value 
and the mean of all the nine neighbouring DC values. The absolute value of the dif- 
ferences are ordered in descend order and the first y direction-values with largest dif- 
ferences are taken to form direction vectors, y is a parameter which can be adjusted 
to get the best retrieval result. These direction vectors are used as DC -Patterns and 
histograms H DC are constructed based on these patterns.

As there is only part of patterns which appear in large quantities and a large num- 
ber of patterns which appear rarely, so in consideration of time-consuming and effi- 
ciency, we just select those DC-Patterns which have higher frequencies as the bins of 
histogram. 

2.4 Application to Image Retrieval 

To evaluate this proposal in image retrieval, we do three classes of experiments by us- 
ing AC-Pattern histogram, DC-Pattern histogram and their combination. For AC- 
Pattern histogram alone or DC-Pattern histogram alone, the descriptor is defined as 
follows: 



D = H 



AC- 



OX 



D = H 



DC 



(7) 



For the combination, 



D = [(1 - a) x H AC ,axH DC ]

where a is a weight parameter that controls the impact of AC-Patterns histogram and 
that of DC-Patterns histogram. 

To measure the similarity between two descriptors we use the Manhattan distance: 



Dis u=1[\ D ' {k) - D J (k) \ 



(9) 



where D{k) demonstrates the vectors of the descriptor and i, j demonstrate the im- 
ages to compare, m indicates the total number of bins in the descriptor. 

3 Paramaters of Descriptor 

This paragraph is dedicated to the parameters that can influence the performance of 
retrieval: the scanning method, the number of coefficients used in AC-Pattern, the 
quantization parameter, the number of bins used in the descriptor, the parameter of 
DC-Pattern y and the weight parameter a . 

The scanning methods for arranging AC coefficients in the AC-Pattern: linear scan 
and zig-zag scan. In the linear scan, used in [4], AC coefficients are ordered from left- 
to-right and top-to-bottom. For most images, much of the signal energy lies at low 
frequencies coefficients that appear in the upper left corner of the DCT. So we pro- 
pose to use zig-zag scan to order the AC coefficients in order to take into account the 
highest coefficients first. By doing this, the coefficients are in the order of increasing 
frequency. So comparing with linear scan, zig-zag scan gains more advantages in us- 
ing coefficients that have higher energies. So we propose to use zig-zag scan instead 
of linear scan for constructing AC-Patterns. These two methods are shown in Fig. 3.

The one is the number of coefficients ( nc ) used in the AC-Pattern. When this value is 
big, more high-frequency coefficients are included in the AC-Patterns. As high frequency 
coefficients have a weak content, it means that the retrieval performance will be more sen- 
sitive to the noise. Furthermore, the total number of different AC-Patterns is also bigger 
and that leads to more time-consuming in image retrieval. When this value is small, the 



232 C. Bai, K. Kpalma, and J. Ronsin 

total number of different AC-Patterns will be small too. Although it leads to less time- 
consuming, it will decrease the performance of the retrieval too. Unlike skipping the coef- 
ficients at the end that have zero values to reduce the size of AC-Pattern [6], we try to find 
a best value of nc for best performance of retrieval and less time-consuming. 

The one is the quantization parameter QP. High QP truncates coefficients leading 
to zero values. If this value is low, the total number of different AC-Patterns will be 
very high, that will make the processing of generating histogram more time- 
consuming and complicated. In contrast, if this value is rather high, there will only be 
a small number of different AC-Patterns, even all the coefficients could be zero. This 
will decrease the performance of image retrieval obviously. So there will be a trade- 
off in quantization parameter between performance and time efficiency. 

The one is the number of bins of the histogram that are used to do retrieval (AC- 
bins for AC-Patterns and DCbins for DC-Patterns). For AC-Pattern histogram, it 
indicates the total number of bins after merging adjacent patterns. For DC-Patterns 
histogram, it represents the number of different DC-Patterns chosen to construct DC- 
Pattern histogram. 

Parameter y and a can also be adjusted. These two parameters have the effect on 
the performance too. 

4 Performance Analysis 

GTF (Georgia Tech Face) and ORL (AT&T Laboratories Cambridge) databases are 
two commonly used databases for face recognition. To evaluate the contribution of 
our proposal, we implement the described method in [4] and our proposal on GTF da- 
tabase and also compare the performance of our proposal with other statistics-based 
approaches applied to ORL database. 

For performance evaluation we use EER (Equal Error Rate) method [4] [5]. If a 
value is used to express the similarity between query images and images in the 
database, so given a certain threshold, an input image of certain class A, may be rec- 
ognized falsely as class B. Then the ratio of how many images of class A have been 
recognized as other class is called FRR (False Rejected Rate), while the ratio of how 
many images of other classes have been recognized into class A is call FAR (False 
Accept Rate). When both rates take equal values, an equal error rate (EER) is got. 
The lower the EER is, the better is the system's performance, as the total error rate is 
the sum of FAR and FRR. One example of EER is showed in Figure 4.

4.1 Application to GTF Database 

The GTF database includes 15 different face images of 50 peoples, from both men 
and women. Most of the images were taken in various illumination conditions, differ- 
ent facial expressions, different scales and orientations, as shown in Fig. 5 and the 
max degree of the face rotation is about 30Â°. For experiments, we select the first 1 1 
images of each person as training database and remain 4 images as test images for re- 
trieval. Therefore, the total number of images in the training database is 550 (11x50) 
and that of test images is 200 (4x50).

Fig. 5. 15 different faces of one person 



Firstly, we use AC-Pattern histogram alone for retrieval. We use the method pre- 
sented in [4] to construct AC-Pattern histograms but using different scanning method 
and different number of coefficients. Figure 6 shows the curve of comparison. As we 
can see, zig-zag scan outperforms the linear scan and best result is EER=0.141 when 
nc = 4 .Furthermore, if we use our proposal to construct AC-Pattern histogram, that 
means not only use zig-zag scan to arrange AC-coefficients in AC -Patterns but also 
merge adjacent patterns, a lower EER=0. 1 1 1 is got when nc = 7 . 

Secondly, we use DC-Pattern histogram alone for retrieval. As our proposal focus 
on AC-Pattern histogram, the purpose of these experiments is to find the best parame- 
ters of the histogram for retrieval. We change the values of y , qpdc and DCbins to 
see the influence on the performance. We can observe that when y = 4 , QPDC = 26 
and DCbins = 400 , the best performance can be got, the lowest EER is 0. 152. 

Finally, we use the combination of the AC-Pattern and DC-Pattern histogram to do 
image retrieval. We give the name to the method presented in [4] as 'linear scan' and 
the name to the method in which AC -Patterns histogram is constructed by our pro- 
posal as 'adjacent zig-zag'. For both methods, we tested different sets of parameters 
to find the one that can assure the best performance. Finally, for 'linear scan', the best 
result is obtained when nc = A,QPAC = 10, ACbins = 550 . And for 'adjacent zig-zag' 



234 C. Bai, K. Kpalma, and J. Ronsin 

method, the best result is observed when nc = 7, QPAC = 10 , ACbins = 35 . And we 
adjust the weight parameter a to see the global comparison of the performance 
(Fig. 7 is the curve). We can conclude, from this figure, that the proposal can improve 
the performance obviously in GTF database. And the best EER of our proposal is 
0.087 when a = 0.25 . 




Fig. 6. Performance of AC-Pattern histogram Fig. 7. Performance of different methods 

4.2 Application to ORL Database 

The ORL database includes 10 different images of 40 peoples. For tests, we use first 6 
images as training database and remain 4 images as test images for retrieval. There- 
fore, the total number of images in the training database is 240 and that of test images 
is 160. We do similar experiments as we did for GTF database. Again, the adjacent 
zig-zag scan method outperforms that of linear scan also and the best EER is 0.05. 

To illustrate the contribution of our proposal, we compare the performance of the pro- 
posed method with those of other methods. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a gen- 
eral method used for identification. It provides an optimal transformation from the original 
image space to an orthogonal eigen space with reduced dimensionality. However, based 
on 2D image matrix, two dimension principal component analysis (2D PCA) is proposed 
for face recognition in recent years. Linear discriminate analysis (LDA) is another typical 
method that uses the global information of whole image to do face recognition. Table 1 
shows the comparison of lowest EER of PCA [7], 2D PCA [8] and LDA [7] [9] reported 
in recent years and the one we got. The best result of ORL is obtained 
when: nc = 4 , qpac = 30 , ACbins = 27 , y = 3 , QPDC = 70 , DCbins = 250 and a = 0.5 . 

From this comparison, we can conclude that adjacent zig-zag method outperforms 
all the other methods.

5 Conclusions 

In this paper we have presented a new way to construct the histogram of DCT patterns 
in the context of face recognition. Zig-zag scanning and adjacent patterns merging are 
proposed for AC-Pattern histogram constructing. When applied for image retrieval on 
two face databases, widely used for evaluating face recognition algorithms, and by 
evaluating comparatively their performance, we can conclude that this proposal for 
AC-Patterns histogram constructing improves retrieval performance. Moreover this 
approach outperforms other statistics-based approaches.

Abstract. In this article, we propose an original model of images 
representation. This work contributes to the subject of the general framework 
for image indexing and retrieval on the WEB. We describe a method to 
construct and quantify images from a semantic model, based on graphs, using a 
set of descriptors. This quantification of the skeleton graph is used for indexing 
images. In the case of images, the retrieval is mostly done by using text 
information (image's name, surrounding text, annotations,...) but the 
information related to content images (color, shape, texture, structure,...) are not 
considered. It is within this context that the proposed approach allows 
automatically to calculate for each object of the image (represented by a region) 
a local descriptor that allows to define its visual and semantic characteristics. 
This approach therefore presents an extension of the classical model of visual 
graph used in information retrieval.

1 Introduction 

A good choice for image descriptors is critical for the system to be effective and 
efficient since the indexing techniques become obsolete if the dimension of 
descriptors increases greatly [6]. To overcome this problem we must: either reduce 
the number of dimensions of attributes or eliminate descriptors that are less important. 
In this phase of determination of image descriptors, there must be a compromise 
between expressiveness, which is provided by many characteristics and performance 
of the system, which is reduced by the large number of descriptors dimensions. It 
should also be noted here that the correct choice of features affects not only the 
indexing phase, but also the procedure to establish the degree of correspondence or 
similarity between the query and images. Once the descriptors are selected, we 
associate to the images an index structure which contains all the features of these 
images. It is within this context that we present here a definition of the image content

with a simple model using a semantic graph used as a support for indexing. For this, 
we propose to rely on a set of existing work in the state of art. The remainder of this 
paper is organized as follow; in Section 2 we present the related work in the field of 
image representation by graphs. We propose our model in Section 3. Section 4 defines 
the approach to instantiate the skeleton model configuration according to images that 
will be represented. Section 5 introduces the results of this quantification of the model 
while comparing the automatic quantification with expert opinion on the basis of 
empirical practice and finally we end with a conclusion. 

2 Related Works 

Models based on graphs for the description of the images have widely been studied by 
different authors, we present in the following section a brief state of the art on the 
issues discussed. 

Early works focused on the use of spatial relationships between image regions for 
their indexing and their retrieval, descriptions by 2D strings [10] capture the 
sequences of appearance of objects along one or more reading directions. Thereafter, 
these works were quickly criticized. 

Ounis and al, in [7], describes the original idea of moving a portion of data 
processing at the time of indexing, so as to speed the matching process. The 
implementation of this idea is to generate to the indexing a data structure containing 
all the specializations of sub-graphs of possible queries. The projection problem is 
thus divided into two sub-problems, one being treated during the indexing and the 
other at the time of retrieval, it remains to identify sub-graphs composing the query to 
retrieve all indexes specializing the query. It follows that the processing time of the 
request becomes polynomial. 

In [5], the authors uses a star graph for define the specific types of concepts. Star 
graphs are simpler than the conceptual graphs and their representations preserves the 
semantics of conceptual graph formalism .However , their modeling by means of a 
vector space and expansion of data is likely to generate many irrelevant dimensions, 
and produce side-effects due to the high dependency between the dimensions of 
space, in addition, there is an aspect of weighting image objects not yet defined, we 
can ask the question of completeness of the chosen criteria, and dependencies 
between these criteria (e.g. a big object has necessarily parts close to the center of the 
image) from which a lack of an evaluation of the weighting, so as to have starting 
points to govern the key points of the weighting. 

Finally, recent works like in [13] which consider the use of parts of images based 
on 2D extended HMM (hidden Markov models). Performances of these approaches 
depend on the network structure and the a priori probabilities in the sense that a 
network with a good graph structure and a good definition of probabilities gives 
reliable results. 

Other works conducted by Pham and al [8], present an approach that integrates 
elements of different types in a representation based on graphs, and uses a language 
model on these graphs for image retrieval. The graph models the image as a set of 
regions (regions associated with visual concepts), and spatial relationships between 



A Representation Model of Images Based on Graphs and Automatic Instantiation 239 

these regions. This representation handles different scenarios, as isolated or grouped 
images are used as bases for learning or testing. 

The results obtained on a problem of categorization of images show first that the 
automatic procedure that combines the concepts to an image is effective, and secondly 
that the use of spatial relations, in addition to concepts, improves the quality of 
classification. This approach presents therefore an extension of the classical model of 
language in information retrieval to address the problem of unannotated image 
retrieval and categorization, represented by graphs. 

All these models have confirmed not only the stability of visual graphs but also the 
benefits of integration of the relationship between different types of concepts. 
Unfortunately they suffer from this lack of difference between the semantic level and 
signal level of the image content as well as spatial relationships between different 
types of concepts and they especially suffer from the lack of consideration of the 
relationships within the facets and between facets of graphs. To address this 
problematic, we propose a new approach of images representation based on a 
semantic graph structure. 

3 A Model for Images 

The model that we present in this section is based on the linguistic content of 
operating in the ground truth and on visual content extracted from the images. 

A process of indexing must use a set of heterogeneous descriptors to answer to a 
panel of request; this is why we are going to define a model of images description 
used as a platform for indexing. 

Definitions: Formally, S is a set of labels of vertices s and A is a set of labels of arcs 
a, a labeled graph for a given image is defined by a quadruplet = (S, A, Nodes, Arcs) 
as: 

- S: set of vertices denoting all regions of the image by concepts. 

- A: set of arcs annotated from the vocabulary associated with the image. 

- Nodes = U Desc(S ; ) C I x S x N x N x D : set of quintuples associated with 
each region i, with : 

Desc(S, ) = {{x,)i , (x 2 )i , (x 3 )i , (x 4 )i , fe),)) with : 

S ; : vertex of the graph that models a region of the image using a concept. We will 
see its representation later. 

(xi)i. instance of the concept associated with the object that represents the region i 
or NULL in case when the concept is abstract. 

(x 2 )i : concept associated with region i. 

(x 3 )i : rank of region i which corresponds to the address of the first pixel located on 
the extreme left in the matrix of image pixels. 

(x/), : plan's level corresponding to the topology of the region i in the image. 

(xs)t : normalized vector (low-level descriptors) of the region i. 

I: set of instances of concepts, each empty instance is denoted by the mark 
'NUL. 



240 A. Benafia et al. 

N: set of integer. 

D: set of descriptors low-level. 

- Arcs = U Rel(S, ) C AxS: set of doublets with Rel(Sj) t ={((y,),, (y 2 )d k } as 
k: number of links of vertex S t with the other vertex. 
(yy),: label associated with the arc that connects the vertex (y 2 ),-. 
(y 2 ),: vertex in liaison with vertex S t via the label (y^),-. 

Support model: To describe the skeleton of the graph used for indexing images, it 
is necessary to associate a support to the description model. 
The defined support here is a pair (C, A) with: 
C: Set of concepts partially ordered by the subsumption relationship. 
A: Set of associations partitioned into subsets of association of the same arity. 
These two sets form the conceptual vocabulary for our model. 

âº Concepts: a concept is modeled by the quadruplet (ident, synony, descend, 
ancest) with: 

ident: name given to the concept. 

synony: different synonymous terms associated with the concept. 

descend: terms of inheriting concept. 

ancest: general terms encompassing the concept. 

âº Associations: an association is expressed either by a verb or a nominal entity. 
It is modeled by the triplet (ident , typ_ass, semant) with: 

ident: name given to the association. 
typ_ass: verb or nominal entity. 

semant: semantic relation associated with the association (subject, location, time, 
etc....). 

4 Instantiating the Model 

This process permit to calculate automatically the different characteristics associated 
with the image and the corresponding regions. We consider three main steps: 

Firstly: segmenting the image into regions. 
Secondly: extracting low-level visual indices. 

Thirdly: interpretation of these indices and their relationship with high-level 
concepts. 

This automatic retrieval process of features is made more workable given the 
learning method used, starting from a subset of annotated images and to learn 
correspondence between visual indices and concepts (see details in the following 
paragraphs). For this, we begin by dividing the image into regions using image 
segmentation algorithm. For each region we calculate the low-level descriptors and 
then move to the calculations of semantic descriptors and finally construct a standard 
vector descriptor for our standard model. All this work leads to the instantiation of our 
model for the representation of images. This model considered as a solid support for 
image indexing and retrieval. 



A Representation Model of Images Based on Graphs and Automatic Instantiation 241 

1- Segmentation: It must allow us to obtain, from an original source image, a cut- 
out into regions serving as base for all future processing (indexing, classification ...). 
It is therefore not to find the best possible segmentation method, but to implement a 
solution that allows to partition an image to regions so that they roughly correspond 
at least to certain objects in the image or obvious parts of an object. There are several 
approaches of segmentation in the literature and the approach retained in our study is 
the homogeneous region segmentation called CSC [9], this choice is justified by the 
fact that this method provides better perceptual vision and ensures textual and color 
homogeneity of image regions (consistency of pixels corresponding to regions on the 
visual and perceptual framework). 

2- Low-level visual descriptors: An image is considered in our model as a whole 
composite region. Each region generated by segmentation is associated to a descriptor 
of low level compound of characteristics of color, texture and shape. 

Color: We chose the sampled space RGB and additive cumulating of the 
histograms weighted by Laplacien. This choice is justified by the fact that the method 
ensures a spatial distribution of colors and offers good performance. The regions 
issued from the segmentation are heterogeneous and to standardize these regions, we 
applied the algorithm of "minimum bounding box" for each image region [14]. We 
associate for each image the corresponding histogram and we cumulate, for the set of 
regions, the associated histograms. 

Texture: There is no relevant definition of texture having regard to irregularity 
distribution of the basic elements of textures (grid, wall, tissue ...) and random textures 
(sand, cloud, grass ...).We opt for the choice of the method "local contour patterns" 
providing histograms with several components (512 in our case). The direction of edges 
goes through the calculation of the patterns of local contours, then by using a 
representation of a histogram with 512 possible values. This is justified by the simplicity 
of the method and especially its proven effectiveness in many applications. 

Shape: The shape considered here, use the Freeman coding of translating the 
course of the contours of the regions following directions (8-connectedness in our 
case). This type of descriptor is used to establish a correlation between regions in the 
process of image matching. The correlation of two regions ij and r 2 represented by the 
series a^ , a 2 , ..., aâ and by , b 2 , ..., b m (n<=m) is defined by: 

1 " 71 

C rlr2 (j) = -X COS ( a /-^+./) X T (1) withj=l...m 

Where a t , bj , represent the various codes associated to directions 8- connectedness 

We add this feature to the region the perimeter and the regions coordinates which 
are often necessary to establish a connection and a more effective comparison 
between regions. 

3- Calculation of rank region: We call the rank of a region i the number of regions 
above the region i from left to right. 



242 



A. Benafia et al. 



The algorithm considered for this computation case helps to determine the status of 
a region compared to other regions of the image according to a benchmark that is 
chosen horizontally from left to right. The calculation of rank proceeds through the 
determination of the first pixel on the left-most among all the pixels constituting the 
examined region. Two regions that have the same index column will have the same 
rank. To clarify this method of calculation we consider the following example:

Fig. 1. Matrix of pixels representing regions of a segmented image 

In this matrix of pixels there are three regions represented by the respective values 
10, 2 and 3. 

The rank corresponding to the region 10 is 1. 

The rank corresponding to the region 2 is 1 . 

The rank corresponding to the region 3 is 3. 

This means that the region 3 is located after the regions 10 and 2 by going 
horizontally from left to right. 

4- Calculation of plan levels: The approach of separating regions into treated plans 
in our case is based primarily on the theory of binocular [11] and takes into account 
the arrangement and dispersion of regions across the surface and the framing of the 
image. This last , containing all the regions is defined by four borders (top, bottom, 
left and right) .The definition of the various plans corresponding to different regions 
is from top to bottom of the frame. At perceptual level, we tend to see an overlay of 
different backgrounds as a successive cover of widths or lengths of the image and 
make contact with the boundaries of the image framing. The region that covers the 
full extent of the border of framing or that covers the greater part of that boundary is 
able to be a part of the background. 

Propriety 1: We say that two regions Tj and r 2 are located in the same plan if and only 
if D/,(r,) = D/,(r ; ) with D/,(r,), D^(ry) distances of the peak (highest) regions rj and r 2 
over the border 'top' the frame. 



Algorithm description: The general algorithm of our approach is summarized as 
follows: 

- For each region r 7 : 

Determine the position of the peak pixel compared to the border of the framing 

'top', D/,(r,) is this position. 

Determine the position of the pixel having the minimum distance compared to the 

border of the framing 'left', D g (ry) is this position. 



A Representation Model of Images Based on Graphs and Automatic Instantiation 243 

Determine the position of the pixel having the minimum distance compared 
to the border of the framing 'right' Dj(tj) is this position. 

- Sort the triplets (Drf(r,), D/,(r,), D^(r,)) according to the associated values to D^(ry) 

- If there are identical triples (D d (r k ),D h (r k ),D g (r k )) (with ke [l,n] such as i = k 
and n is the number of segmented regions) then Apply the coverage 
procedure two to two between these regions. 

- Establish the sequence of triplets D rf (r,), D A (r,), D^(r,) already sorted. 



Heuristic coverage regions: The originality of our heuristic is based on the theory 
of the concept of visual field and binocular vision of each eye that is limited to 62Â° 
which gives an intersection of two fields in the form of a W. This heuristic uses the 
calculation of surfaces of regions and their locations compared to the framings 'top' 
and 'bottom'. 

The principle of the visual field that we baptize W_space to decompose the image, 
allows to put two peaks on each framing border 'top' and 'bottom' as : 



peakl = L/4 



(2) 



peak2 = 3*L/4 



(3) 



We note that L is the length of the frame 'top' and 'bottom'. 

By aligning these four peaks with the two ends of the framing 'top' and 'bottom' of 
the image to reach a W form called W_space .

Propriety 2: r,- and r,- are the two regions to cover and N(r) is the number of pixels 
located on the set of borders 'top', 'left' and 'right' of the region r.

number of regions r,-.

- If N(ri) < N(rj) with i # j then rj is located in the first plan compared to ri and 
vice versa. 

5- Semantic descriptors: To automate the labeling of semantic concepts in each 
analyzed region, it is necessary to establish the signal-symbol correspondence. Such a 
link called labeling consists in partnering with different regions of images one or 
more concepts or keywords. For this calculation of semantic descriptors, two steps are 
required: 

- Labeling regions - visual labels. 

- Visual tagging labels - semantic concepts. 

We present briefly each of these procedures: 

- Labeling regions - visual labels: it allows to associate visual labels to segmented 
regions of image based on low-level descriptors. The visual similarity of the regions 
requires the use of a learning process. During this process few images issued from the 
segmentation are given and their use determines the label corresponding to particular 
regions and the learning process can therefore initiate. Once the learning process 
completed, the labeling of new regions is done by searching the nearest point 
(represented in our method by the center of gravity) to visual labels. 

In Fig. 3, on the left is an image segmented into regions; each one is identified by 
its center of gravity and on the right the space of corresponding visual labels. 




Fig. 3. Labeling regions - labels visual 

- Labeling labels - Visual semantic concepts: it can correct the remaining stumbling 
block not yet remedied during the previous step. The description of the ground truth 
represents a solid support to overcome the deficiencies caused earlier thanks to this 
correspondence "label-visual concepts" that we can build from different linguistic 
structures inherent in the ground-truth (proximity, simultaneity appearance ...). In 
Fig.4, we can associate automatically to a visual label one or more concepts. 



A Representation Model of Images Based on Graphs and Automatic Instantiation 245 




Fig. 4. Labeling of labels visual space (visual vocabulary) and space of concepts (vocabulary of 
concepts) 

To elucidate the main idea of the approach, we consider the example of Fig. 5 and 
present an image to the left and on the right its segmentation.

We note in particular that the sea is represented by regions 1, 2 and 3. By applying 
the process of regions passage to visual labels, we have this assignment: 



Region 6 (xo'.yGi

Region3 (x3, y3)

13 (regular background, gray, ...)

Fig. 6. Labeling space regions - visual space labels 

We see that regions 1, 2 and 5 have very similar numerical characteristics under 
K-Means (classification algorithm chosen in our learning system); likewise for the 
regions 2 and 6. 

In the second passage, the specifications of the ground-truth [1] annihilate the 
remaining unresolved ambiguities in the previous phase. For example, the 
specifications "... blue sea over the entire surface below the image." can then update 
the prototype station by removing the link between region 2 and 13 to replace it with 
the link region 2 and 11 and therefore merge the three regions 1, 2 and 3 substitute for 
a single region (based on the criterion of proximity and connectivity between 
regions); likewise for Region 5 (Blue Sky across the high width of the image).

The region merging procedure that we developed in our system is described by an 
iterative process that allows for each image region to consider the neighboring regions 
and test whether they are close in the sense k-means, if they are so we merge them 
and we update the graph and repeat this process up until there will be no more regions 
that are close (stability of the graph). 

In [2] we can find details of this approach to annotation. The restructuring of the 
graph is a challenging task and requires a lot of time especially when the number of 
regions increases ; however, we contemplate in the future to define operators specific 
to the management of our model (e.g. merging, bursting, reification, etc.), they can 
take into account the fact that the images or objects to be compared are generally over- 
or under-segmented ; moreover, they can provide better support to the graph above 
pairing problems necessary for establishing the similarity between objects or images. 

6- Calculation of the resulting descriptor: The performance of automatic generation 
of descriptors are based on two measures commonly used in the classification, these 
two measures are the precision and recall and they are often used because they reflect 
the views of the user: if the precision is low, the user will be dissatisfied with the fact 
that there is a discrepancy between his views on the descriptors perceived on the 
images and the descriptors provided by our system, so they do not interest him .For 
the automatic definition of descriptors used for the quantification of graph from data 
extracted from the image to model, we have two approaches: 

- Each descriptor is calculated separately. The type of classification that is 

suitable for this solution is the late classification where each descriptor 
generates its own classification and the final result will be the fusion of these 
different obtained classifications. 

- Group the characteristics issued from different descriptors before classification 

and as the nature and dimension of feature vectors vary from one descriptor to 
another, normalizing the values of each vector is performed to obtain the 
concatenation of these characteristics. This descriptor judged as global is the 
convenient type of classification for this type of solution that is the early 
classification. 

We will determine in the experimental part from obtained results, which approach 
is better between the two ones. 



5 Experiments 

1- Principle: The purpose of this study is to determine from a sample of images (test 
basis) the appropriateness of different descriptors defined in our model. For this we 
considered two scenarios: 

- consider separately each descriptor. 

- consider the merger of descriptors. 

Our model contains five types of descriptors corresponding respectively to the 
color, texture, shape, rank-level and semantic concepts. All these attributes are 
calculated locally in each region. 



A Representation Model of Images Based on Graphs and Automatic Instantiation 247 

The sample used for the protocol is a set of 200 images drawn randomly from the 
database of images from the site http : / / www . ni f f ylux . com. These images are 
sorted by category (landscape, building...); the relevance assessment of these features 
uses two test bases. One of the tests is performed in an empirical way by an expert 
with the selection of a relevance threshold set in advance, and a second base as a 
working basis for our model. The expert, with his cognition and knowledge, analyzes 
and quantifies each image according to the descriptors defined in our model. The 
instantiation of the model is manually done in this case by the expert. The first base 
will therefore serve us as a reference-result of an estimation done by the expert, and 
the second base will contain all descriptors calculated by our system using the 
algorithms defined in the previous section. The evaluation results obtained by our 
system are based on data found in the first base. 

2- Variables and Parameters: The quantification of the graph structure is based on 
two variables which are: The number of regions that compose the analyzed image and 
the type of descriptors considered and an unique parameter which is the number of 
categories of semantic concepts (mountain, city, car ...). 

To study the quantification of the proposed model, we leave on the basis of a 
screening of the images over the number of regions they contain that is to say, we take 
images with two regions then those with three regions and so on until 1 1 regions, and 
the images containing more than eleven regions, it means a total of 1 1 cases to study. 

3- Method of evaluation: To evaluate our results, we will support the classical 
evaluation measures from data mining. These measures are defined by the precision, 
recall and F-measure. We are therefore interested in calculating the score of the latter 
which is a balanced measure of precision and recall. 

We note the precision P, R the recall, Nt the total number of correct answers 
provided, Nc the number of responses correct provided by our model and Ni the 
number of incorrect answers provided by our model 

P = Nc/(Nc + Ni) ; R = Nc/Nt ; F-measure = (2 x P x R) / (P + R) 

4- Results: In Tablel, we calculated for each class of regions, precision 
calculations for the different descriptors (color, texture, etc. ...). 

For example for the class that contains four regions, the different F-measures for 
the five preceding descriptors are respectively 0.9607, 0.6039, 0.8824, 0.7194 and 
0.6543. Calculation of these indicators is obtained from the arithmetic mean of the F- 
measure calculated for all tested images. 

In Table2, we have merged all the descriptors discussed above into a single 
standardized global descriptor acquired by a weighted combination of descriptors. 
The weighting is done according to the degree of descriptors importance in relation 
with annotations to be done on the images and especially on an attributed favor to the 
descriptors of large dimensions. 

5- Interpretation: Based on values of Tablel, we can see that whatever the number 
of regions and the number of concepts taken, the color descriptor produces results 
close to the results expected by the expert despite the tiny quadratic quantification 
error; this is reflected in the choice of the algorithm used to guarantee the 



248 



A. Benafia et al. 



conservation of color as it is perceived. For the evaluation of the other descriptors 
(texture, region-level and semantic concepts) on the contrary, we observe that the F- 
measure is low from the images having 5 regions, we can therefore say that the 
measure of relevance can be judged acceptable from this threshold and beyond that 
number the accuracy is far from acceptable. Table2 presents insufficient accuracy for 
the global descriptor combining the different descriptors; moreover the results of this 
evaluation are not homogeneous. These results provide yet less acceptable 
performance because of the descriptors combination method using an insufficient 
weighting to establish that order of importance between descriptors.

A Representation Model of Images Based on Graphs and Automatic Instantiation 249 

In sum, we can conclude that the instantiation of the model is less efficient when 
the number of regions coming from the segmentation increases as we note that the 
accuracy of the descriptors is significantly low compared to other measures for n> 1 1 
(n: the number of regions) on the one hand, and on the other hand the merger of 
descriptors does not give acceptable results (see reasons above). Therefore, we can 
confirm that the more the image contains regions, the more the computing 
performance of descriptors (texture, map-region, semantic concepts, global 
descriptor) degrade due to this rigid parameter due to the heterogeneity of the image 
indicating the presence of several objects of different natures in an image. 

We have done the same evaluations changing at each time the parameter 
concerning the number of concepts and we have noticed that the higher this parameter 
is, the higher precision measurements concerning the descriptors are decreased, hence 
the best performance is obtained from a threshold equal to 6 (6 semantic concepts). 

6 Conclusion and Outlook 

We introduced in this paper a new approach to indexing images through a graph 
based on a representation combining several descriptors. We proposed an original 
model that will be defined as a support for image indexing and retrieval. Image 
modeling using graphs captures any spatial-topological structures and admits a 2D/3D 
representation. From the formal point of view, our model fits into the approaches 
based on labeled graphs model, and extend a number of subsequent work (definition 
of the model's dynamic). On a practical level, the use of regions and associated 
concepts allows a gain in generality when describing images, a generality that is 
beneficial when the use of the system differs from the training environment. This has 
great chances to occur in practice as we consider collections where one or more 
images can be used to represent a scene. The proposed model is able to serve as an 
indexing structure to respond to any form of queries. 

As a perspective to this work, we plan to evaluate the similarity of two graphs, this 
point involves having a similarity measure that may be able to quantify and qualify 
the difference between two graphs and taking into account the labels associated to 
components of graphs; that is to say, the similarity of two vertices or two arcs must be 
based on labels that share and make the approach more tolerant to differences in the 
sense where two graphs are not identical. For this, it remains to add to the model all 
the necessary operations for the handling of its concepts, which allows to define a 
flexibility in the management of skeletons of configurations related to the images. 
Finally the definition of algebra for our model is necessary and even indispensable for 
the study of matching graphs, thus the similarity of images.

Abstract. Conventional context-aware recommendation systems do not provide 
information before user action, although they provide information considering 
users' ongoing activity. However, users want to know prior information such as 
how to go to their destination or get necessary items when they plan to do out- 
door activities such as climbing and sightseeing. It takes time to collect the prior 
information since it is not so easy to appropriately find them. This paper proposes 
a method for extracting prior advices from the web. The method first identifies 
whether a given sentence is an advice or not. Then the method identifies whether 
the sentence is a prior advice or not if the sentence is identified as advice. In 
this paper, we will show availability of the proposed method through our experi- 
mentation. We also developed a system for providing prior information using the 
proposed method. 



1 Introduction 

With the development of mobile devices such as smart phones and tablet PCs, we often 
access the Internet and get knowledge and information in outside. Therefore, context- 
aware systems have been researched in recent years [ 1 ]. In particular, information rec- 
ommendation systems considering users' contexts have been developed I 2I8I11I131I . 
However, they did not fully consider contents of information provided to users since 
their main research interests were to recognize users' contexts and they provided users 
with prepared information or information based only on users' position. 

Users want to know prior information such as how to go to their destination or get 
necessary items, when they plan to do outdoor activities such as climbing and sightsee- 
ing. For instance, when they plan to climb Mt. Fuji, they want to know the means of 
transportation to Mt. Fuji and the needed climbing gear before leaving. In outdoor ac- 
tivities, users' contexts are divided into two main categories: before or during activities. 
The existing information recommendation systems considering users' contexts do not 
provide information before user action, although they provide information considering 
users' ongoing activity.

Prior information on outdoor activities are written in blogs by many people and 
stored on the web. We could provide users with valuable information if we use the 
web as a collective information. However, it takes time to collect the prior information 
since it is not so easy to appropriately find them using existing web search engines and 
most web pages containing the prior information include information useful during ac- 
tual activities. In conventional researches for text mining, sentences containing users' 
experiences and troubles were extracted[4 7 9 10]. However, the extracted information 
could not be identified as prior information since they did not consider situations for 
using the extracted information. 

In this paper, we propose a method for extracting prior advices from the web to 
provide prior information before user action. We first identify whether a given sentence 
is an advice or not. Then, we identify whether the sentence is a prior advice or not if 
the sentence is identified as an advice. We also developed a system for providing prior 
information using the proposed method. 

2 Characteristics Analysis of Advices 

2.1 The Definition of Advices 

Advices are sentences containing information which is worthy to provide users be- 
fore or during their activities. In the following sections, we assume that the target lan- 
guage is Japanese. TableQJshows advices about climbing Mt. Fuji. The third column in 
Table Q] represents whether the sentence is an advice or not. If the sentence is an ad- 
vice, the value in the column is 1, otherwise, the value is 0. There exist appropriate 
situations for using the advices. However, the situations are various and depend on ac- 
tivities. In this paper, we assume that situations in which the advices is useful can be 
categorized into two types; before and during activities. This is because we consider 
situations which are common to variety of activities. We discriminate between them by

judging whether a given advice is needed before taking action. The fourth column in 
Table Q] represents whether the advice is needed before activities or not. If the advice 
is needed preliminarily, the value in the column is 1. Otherwise, the value is 0. For 
instance, the first example is a prior advice and the second one is an action advice. 

2.2 Construction of Development Data 

We constructed development data to analyze characteristics of advices. Firstly, we 
searched the web by using "sÂ±[ll (Mt. Fuji) & 3Â£Uj (climbing)" and "W-MlE (Mt. 
Hotaka) & 3^ ill (climbing)" as queries and collected top 50 web pages from search 

results for each query. We used Yahoo! Web APlLj to search the web. Next, we ex- 
tracted texts from the web pages and split them into sentences. Finally, we manually 
judged whether each sentence is an advice or not and then manually judged whether 
the sentence is a prior advice or not if the sentence is an advice. Note that we judged 
them by referring to the previous and next sentences of the sentence. The size of the 
development data is shown in Table [2]

2.3 Characteristics of Advices 



We manually investigated 6725 sentences in the development data to capture charac- 
teristics of advices. We carefully analyzed the data to capture general characteristics 
which do not represent a particular domain although the development data represents 
climbing. Consequently, we found the following five characteristics: 

A. function word at sentence end 

We found that advices are often described in a polite way. While most of sentences 
described in past tense and interrogative sentences are not advices. In Japanese, 
tense, aspect and modality of a sentence are often represented by function words at 
the end of the sentence. Therefore, we capture these writing styles by focusing on 
function words at the end of a sentence as shown in the underlined portions in the 
examples 2 and 3 in TableQ] 

B. evaluation expressions 

We found that advices often contain expressions having a semantic polarity. The 
example 4 is an advice containing positive or negative evaluation expressions and 
the underlined portions represent evaluation expressions.

254 



S. Kozawa et al. 



C. clue expressions 

We manually generated 470 expressions which were often contained in advices and 
classified them into 35 classes based on their meaning. Some of the expressions are 
shown in Table [3] The example 1 is an advice containing the clue expressions in 
the underlined portions. 

D. sentence end information 

We found that appearance position of evaluation and clue expressions in a sentence 
is important. For example, a clue expression " * Â® (recommend)" is appeared at 
the end of the sentence in the example 1 which is an advice. While the example 5 
is not an advice even though it contains the same clue expression. As seen in these 
examples, the advices often contain evaluation and clue expressions at the end of a 
sentence since a content word at the end of a sentence often plays important role in 
representing the sentence meaning in Japanese. 

E. context information 

It is often the case that the previous and next sentences of an advice are also advices 
since advices are often collectively described in a web page. Thus, the evaluation 
and clue expressions frequently appear in the previous and next sentences of an 
advice.

2.4 Characteristics of Advices Suitable for Situations 

We manually investigated 1259 advice sentences in the development data to capture 
characteristics of prior and action advices, and found the following four characteristics: 



clue expressions 

We manually generated 457 expressions which often appeared in prior advices and 
classified them into 17 classes based on their meaning. We also manually generated 
109 expressions which were often contained in action advices and classified them 
into nine classes based on their meaning. Some of the expressions are shown in 
Table |U The class names attached with * in the first column in Table [4] represent 
clue expressions for action advices. The examples 6 and 7 are advices containing 
the clue expressions in the underlined portions.

"lit, "C# -5 (can, possible, able, etc.) 



B. action verbs 

The action advices often contain action verbs which represent bodily movement. 
The example 8 contains an action verb "S5 (climb)". 

C. sentence end information 

We found that prior advices often contain clue expressions for prior advices at the 
end of sentence and action advices often contain clue expressions for action advices 
and action verbs at the end of sentence. 

D. context information 

The advices are frequently described collectively. Therefore, the clue expressions 
for prior advices are often contained in the previous and next sentences of a prior 
advice. The clue expressions for action advices and action verbs are often contained 
in the previous and next sentences of an action advice in the same way. 



3 Prior Advice Acquisition 

Figure Q] shows the flow for extracting prior advices. Firstly, we search the web by 
using a location name and an action name as a query and get HTML texts whose title 
includes the location name. Yahoo! Web API is used for searching the web. Secondly, 
we preprocess the HTML texts and extract sentences from them. Thirdly, each sentence 
is identified whether it is an advice or not by a classification learning. Finally, each 
extracted advice is identified whether it is a prior advice or not.

3.1 Preprocessing 

Sentences are extracted from HTML texts by the following method. The texts enclosed 
by the HTML tags are extracted if "id" or "class" attributes in HTML tags contain any 
of the following strings. 

contentCentryCmain 

Otherwise, the texts enclosed by the body tags are extracted. Note that the texts enclosed 
by the HTML tags are eliminated from the targets if "id" or "class" attributes in HTML 
tags contain any of the following strings. 

head, foot, menu, copy, list, comment 

Then each sentence extracted from the texts is segmented into morphological elements 
using MeCab[6] and the sentences which meet the following requirements are extracted. 
The stopword list is used to eliminate advices for browsing web pages. 

â¢ The number of morphemes in the sentence is more than five. 

â¢ The sentence contains any of verbs, adverbs, adjectives or auxiliary verbs. 

â¢ The sentence does not contain any of the stopwords (ex. submit, account, browser, 
Adobe, JavaScript, spam, comment). 

3.2 Advice Acquisition 

We identify whether a given sentence is an advice or not by using a classification learn- 
ing. The characteristics of advices described in Section [231 are used as features of the 
classification learning. The features for acquiring advices are shown as follows. The 
features through a to e correspond to the characteristics through A to E in Section 1231 
respectively. 

a. An auxiliary verb at the end of the sentence is any of the following auxiliary verbs. 

'fe, h, fcV', '-<L\ 'fc\ 'fcW, 'fc\ ' 5 ', "tM-, 'r' Â£"?>', 'â¢&*?', '&L 
V*',etc. 

b. The frequencies of evaluative expressions (13,590 expressions for four classes) 
The evaluative expressions in the dictionaries 1 3 5 ] are used. 

c. The frequencies of clue expressions (470 expressions for 35 classes) 

d. Whether the content word (noun, verb, adjective and adverb) at the end of the sen- 
tence is evaluative and clue expression or not. 

Note that we checked its previous content word if the content word is one of the 
following words 

e. Through b to d for the previous and next two sentences of the target sentence 
/. The morpheme length 

g. The ratio of the number of morphemes to the morpheme length for each part-of- 
speech

3.3 Situation Classification of Advices 

We identify whether a given advice is a prior advice or not by using a classification 
learning. The characteristics of advices described in Section l2!4l are used as features of 
the classification learning. The features for classifying advices are shown as follows. 
The features through a to d correspond to the characteristics through A to D in Section 
12.41 respectively. 

a. The frequencies of clue expressions for prior (457 expressions for 17 classes) and 
clue expressions for action (109 expressions for nine classes) 

b. The frequencies of action verbs (447 verbs for two classes) 

We used 76 verbs which represent movement and 371 verbs which represent body 
movement in a thesaurus of predicate-argument structure lfl2l . 

c. Whether the content word (noun, verb, adjective and adverb) at the end of the sen- 
tence is the clue expressions and the action verbs or not. 

Note that we checked its previous content word for some of the content word in the 
same way as the feature d in Section [3T2l 

d. Through a to c for the previous and next two sentences of the target sentence 

4 Experiment 

We carried out experiments to show the performance of the proposed method and to 
validate our observed features. 

4.1 Evaluation Data 

We constructed evaluation data. Firstly, we searched the web by using "FSjJllll (Mt. 
Takao) & Sill (climbing)" as a query and extracted top 20 web pages whose ti- 
tle included the location name "ffjilllj (Mt. Takao)". We used Yahoo! Web API to 
search the web. Secondly, sentences were extracted from the web pages by the pre- 
processing method described in Section 3.1. Finally, we manually judged whether 
each sentence was an advice or not and then judged whether the advice was a prior 
advice or not if the sentence was an advice. The size of the evaluation data is shown 

in Tabled 



4.2 Experiment for Acquiring Advices 

We carried out experiments by training 6725 sentences in the development data as train- 
ing data and testing 1335 sentences in the evaluation data as testing data. As features

for a classification learning, the features described in Section [3721 were used. We used 
Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a machine learning model and trained SVM with a 
linear kernel using LibS VrV(j. We used the precision (ratio of the number of successfully 
acquired advices to the number of automatically acquired advices), the recall (ratio of 
the number of successfully acquired advices to the number of advices in the evaluation 
data) and the f-measure as metrics. In the baseline method, we used word uni-gram as 
features. 

Experimental results are shown in Table [6] The results when each feature was elim- 
inated from the proposed method are shown in through forth to eighth rows in Table 
[6] In comparison with the baseline method, the proposed method increased in both the 
precision and the recall. The f-measure decreased when each feature was eliminated 
from the proposed method. This results show that our features obtained by the analysis 
described in Section [231 are valid. 



4.3 Experiment for Classifying Situation of Advices 

We carried out experiments by training 1259 advice sentences in the development data 
as training data and testing 172 advice sentences in the evaluation data as testing data. 
As features for a classification learning, the features described in Section [3~3l were used. 
We used SVM as a machine learning model and trained SVM with a linear kernel using 
LibSVM. We used the precision (ratio of the number of successfully acquired prior 
advices to the number of automatically acquired prior advices), the recall (ratio of the 
number of successfully acquired prior advices to the number of prior advices in the 
evaluate data) and the f-measure as metrics. In the baseline method, we used word uni- 
gram as features. 

Table|7]shows the experimental results. Both the precision and recall obtained by us- 
ing the proposed method showed more increase than the baseline method. The

f-measure decreased when each feature was eliminated from the proposed method. This 
results show that our features obtained by the analysis described in Section lZ/il are aval- 
ible for classifying situations of adivces. 

5 Conclusion 

In this paper, we proposed a method for extracting prior advices from the web to provide 
prior information before user action. The experimental results show the availability of 
our method. We also developed the system for providing prior advices. 

For future works, we will identify whether a given advice is related to the target 
location and the target action or not. In addition, we would like to consider more detailed 
situations.

1 Introduction 

Today, presentation slides are often used at the congresses, lectures, discus- 
sions/meetings, etc. as useful/powerful support tools for speakers. However, currently 
usable presentation tools such as Microsoft PowerPoint [1], and Apple Keynote [2], 
may not be always convenient for speakers, who must talk along a sequence of slides 
preset in composition phase. Namely, composition phase and presentation phase are 
completely separated in the conventional tools: in the composition phase the speaker 
edits his slides individually with the related topics and sets the sequence under his 
presentation story; and in the presentation phase he must talk along the preset se- 
quence, but cannot rearrange the sequence easily or use other slides corresponding to 
the reactions of audiences without any overheads. The traditional presentation support 
tool is very rigid but not flexible. 

Such a framework disturbs speakers from timely assigning the correlated relation- 
ships to predecessor/successor slides on his way. Tufte pointed out that the slides 
which were composed by the presentation tools do not have consistent relationships 
among contents because the key parts of corresponding contents in each slide are not 
always clear [3, 4]. Various researches, which compose automatically the presentation 
slides or support the preparation process of slides effectively, have been reported. Ya- 
sumura et al. proposed a method to generate the corresponding slides in HTML from 
a paper in LaTex style-file [5]. Also, Miyamoto et al. proposed a method to compose 
the slides from ones in LaTex style-files [6]. This method not only extracts some in- 
formation about the title, figures and so on, based on the commands embedded in 
LaTex style-file, but also identifies the connective relationship among sentences by 
using conjunctions. Moreover, Kurohashi et al. reported an interesting means to first 
extract knowledge segments called knowledge cards from a paper, and then generate 
automatically appropriate slides from the knowledge cards [7]. These methods make 
it possible to generate the enumeration type of slide structures, but impossible to de- 
code or allocate items so as to represent the contents effectively in 2-dimensional 
slide sheets. 

In this paper, we address a slide composition method to make up various kinds of 
components with respect to the visual understandability and the structural/semantic 
slide structure. Our idea is to compose slides from the presentation scenario, prede- 
fined by another specification tool [8]. In order to make the transformation between

two different components successful, we introduce semantic relationships to distin- 
guish the related features of presentation scenario, and determine the allocation pro- 
cedure on the basis of the related features. 



2 Approach 

2.1 Document Structure 

Usually, document structure is defined with logical structure and geometric structure 
[9]. The logical structure is semantic relationships among document elements such as 
the title, texts, sub-texts, figures, tables, footnotes and so on. The elements have their 
own physical features: the size, length, location, font style and size in texts, etc. The 
semantic relationships are assigned among two or more elements: is-a, part-of, group- 
ing, etc. The geometric structure is related to the physical positions of individual ele- 
ments from a location-oriented point of view on the sheet: neighboring, left-right, 
upper-lower, overlap, etc. Thus, it is important to transform the elements from logical 
structure to geometric structure. Figure 1 shows this transformation mechanism. The 
transformation is dependent on the semantic relationships among the elements in the 
logical structure and the physical properties of elements, and is performed interpreta- 
tively from the upper elements in the logical structure, which is specified commonly 
by a tree structure. 

We introduce the idea to transform the properties and relationships from the logical 
structure to the geometric structure. Here, our description in the logical structure is 
corresponded to the presentation scenario which can be interactively composed with 
other tools [8]. Figure 2 shows an example of scenarios displayed on window. Indi- 
vidual main items are linked among related items, and circles surround directly

related items. A set of items surrounded by the circle are candidates for slide compo- 
nents in one sheet. On the presentation scenario, the semantic relationships between 
individual items are denoted meaningfully by colored arrows, and can be interpreta- 
tively set into the locations in the geometric structure. Table 1 shows the semantic re- 
lationship to be attached with links. 

2.2 Processing Flow 

Our basic mechanism is the mapping based on the presentation scenario, and the 
processing flow is mainly composed of two different steps: editing and allocation. 
The logical structure (scenario) and properties of items are set at the editing step, and 
the geometric structure (template slide) is composed in the allocation step. In the ed- 
iting step, the following rules are usable for components to be edited: 

1) The amount of components in a slide is not too much; 

2) The linguistic representation in a text component is simple; 

3) Figures are included. 



264 T. Watanabe, Y. Ishiguro, and K. Hanaue 

If these rules cannot be well applied, the messages for modification request and 
new modification plan are indicated. On the other hand, in the allocation step two 
composition rules are mainly effective: 

1) Easy to grasp the component groups meaningfully; 

2) Necessary to represent explanation contents in figure-like form. 

In order to grasp the component groups meaningfully, it is reasonable that the 
components to be assigned to the same groups should be located in neighboring posi- 
tions and that the components which belong to different groups are assigned compara- 
tively to independent positions. Also, in order to represent explanation contents in 
figure-like form, it is effective to specify the relationships among components by di- 
rected arrows or make use of templates which can represent visually the relationships 
among components, such as SmartArt in PowerPoint. Our approach is to first group 
components based on the semantic relationship, and then compose slides by using ap- 
propriate templates which are consistent to semantic relationships. In semantic rela- 
tionships, components which have inclusive relationships such as "outline/details", 
"complement/comment", etc. can be collected into the same group, while the compo- 
nents which have comparative relationships such as "opposition", "cause/result", etc. 
can be collected into different groups. 

3 Slide Editing 

3.1 Semantic Relationship 

The slide component c is defined as the following five-terms tuple: 

c = ( id, content, type, role, size ) (1) 

type Â£= { text, figure } 

role 6= { title, point, normal } 

Here, id is an identifier of component and content is an explanation instance like 
character strings in text, and figures in figure. Also, type is the kind of components, 
and role is the role for topic, related to c. For example, role is title of topic, abstract of 
topic and normal component, size is available for figure: in this case, size keeps hori- 
zontal length and vertical length. The semantic structure SSt for a topic t, which is 
specified by the corresponding semantic relationship, is: 

SSt = ( Ct, Rt ) (2) 

Here, Ct is a set of slide components in t, and SSt is represented as a directed graph 
which regards the component in Ct as the node. Rt is a set of directed edges, and cor- 
responds to a set of relationships among components in Ct. 

Rt= { ( type, c sm c dst ) I c sm c ds , e Ct } (3) 

Here, type is a semantic relationship between components c src and c dsh and ( type, c src , 
c ds , ) represents a directed edge from c src to c ds , with label type. 



Automatic Composition of Presentation Slides Based on Semantic Relationships 265 



3.2 Editing Operation 

Basic editing operations are: 

1) Add, update and delete components; 

2) Assign new attributes to components; 

3) Assign semantic relationship to combine two or more components. 

In the editing phase, when the currently composed slides are not always consistent 
to conventional rules, contained often in the guideline [4] to judge whether these rules 
should be applicable, the system prompts individual modification plans and keeps the 
corresponding conditions and means applicable to edited slides. Table 2 shows such 
conditions and means. In this case, the modification plan is fired when one of these 
conditions is particularly matched with an arbitrary semantic relationship among all 
components. 



4 Slide Composition 

Our slide composition process is organized as illustrated in Figure 3. The first step is 
to group correlated components based on semantic relationships. The second step is to 
compose the presentation form of slide with respect to the grouped components. The 
final step is to select a template suitable to this presentation form and then allocate the 
corresponding components into a slide sheet, according to the selected template.

4.1 Grouping of Slide Components 

The group is a set of strongly related slide components. This grouping procedure dis- 
tinguishes two different types of components: one is to extract a collection of compo- 
nents contained meaningfully by a component c; and the other is to identify a set of 
components, which are equivalent to c. The former group is called a child-group for c, 
and the latter is called a brother-group for c. Table 1 shows such two groups for 



266 T. Watanabe, Y. Ishiguro, and K. Hanaue 

semantic relationships. For a topic t, a group of various components in the semantic 
structure SSt is called the presentation structure for / and is expressed as ESt. ESt is a 
tree structure whose root is a title, whose nodes are independent components such as 
components of child-group or brother-group, and whose edges are semantic relation- 
ships between components. 

ESt = { ( c, G c c , G C N ) I cG Ct } (4) 

Here, G c c is the child-group for c, G C N is the brother-group for c. 

G c c ={( type, G c ) I ( type, c, c' ) Â£E Rt } (5) 

G C N = { ( type, G c ) I ( fy/?e, c, c' ) e Rt } 

Here, type is a semantic relationship to be defined between c and c'. The procedure 
generates ESt from the semantic structure for t, based on component group.

4.2 Template-Based Slide Composition 

Our template is typically a slide frame which is collected from practically used slides 
or designed abstractly as a semantic unit. Its form specification indicates in detail the 
semantic relationships among components in comparison with template sheets, sup- 
plied in PowerPoint. The group is interpreted as a node in the tree structure, and the 
connection among groups and the semantic relationship on a group collection are cor- 
responded as edge and its label, respectively. Thus, the appropriate template can be

selected by comparing the presentation structure of template with subsets of semantic 
structure among components in a slide sheet. 

Templates suitable to the structure among slide components are selected after we 
have compared the presentation structure to be effective for allocation with a tree 
structure on the corresponding template. We looked upon the slide in which we could 
allocate all components completely as a certain slide to be generated. After we have 
selected appropriate templates, the corresponding components are allocated into the 
pre-assigned areas of template when the applicable conditions are satisfied. In this 
case, the allocated areas are composed of area which is useful to allocate groups, and 
area which keeps in advance for future usage. Our applicable conditions mainly con- 
sist of two different criteria: the condition for structure indicates whether the given 
group and its related un-allocated group are consistent to the presentation structure of 
template; and the condition for area points out whether the components can be located 
sufficiently in the assigned area. 

5 Prototype System 

Our prototype system was implemented in JAVA. Also, the slide displayed in our al- 
location interface is usable on Apache POI [10], usable in Microsoft Office. 

5.1 Component Editing Interface 

Interface of editing slide components was implemented, using Piccolo [11] as a zoom- 
ing interface API. Also, the lexical analyzer, which was used to detect modification 
points, is Sen [12] in JAVA. The menu "add" indicates to add a new component such 
as image, text, etc. into the existing template and also the menu "support" checks 
whether the existing slide was organized suitably under our conditions or not; if not 
suitable, the slide plan to be appropriately modified is indicated. An example is shown 
in Figure 4. In this example, since the slide does not include even an image compo- 
nent, the system advises to use image components so as to make the total balance 
stable and keep the high visualization by a message "HffJÂ§rV N 'il/cfc 5 (use image 
components)". Additionally, the modification message, in which the corresponding 
text is colored by "yellow", is promoted since the system regarded that the description 
style is different from others. 

Moreover, operations for deletion, update and tagging are available. The tagging as- 
signs an attribute such as "title", "abstract", "important viewpoint" and so on to the 
newly selected components, when any tags are not attached to the attributes of compo- 
nents. The update operation modifies the contents of components. In the text update, 
the component is updated by exchanging string contents in dialog. On the other hand, 
in the image update the size is adjusted in special window, as shown in Figure 5. 

5.2 Display Interface 

This window interface enforces to choose the most preferable slide form several can- 
didates, generated by the system. The interface is shown in Figure 6. The candidates 
are arranged in the lower side of display window. The appropriate slide can be chosen

slide is output in PowerPoint form. 

Here, we show examples in Figure 7 and Figure 8. In individual figures, the upper

generated by our prototype system with the interpretation of the corresponding pres- 
entation scenario (in the upper illustration). The right form is a slide made manually 
by the original speaker. Though system-made slides are not always well structured in 
points of space allocation in comparison with hand-made slides, the geometric struc- 
ture is well evaluated.

6 Conclusion 



In this paper, we proposed an experimental method to compose automatically presen- 
tation slides, based on the transformation mechanism from the logical structure to the 
geometric structure. Although this concept of logical structure and geometric structure 
with a view to interpreting document organization has been successfully investigated 
as research fields of document image understanding, in our case this transformation 
takes an important role to compose the presentation slides: the logical structure is the 
presentation scenario; and the geometric structure is the slide template. Our idea was 
to assign the semantic relationships to the related slide components in order to attain 
the transformation powerfully. Some slides, composed automatically by our prototype 
system, are successfully generated in our experimental evaluation. Of course, it is 
necessary to improve the ability in order to compose more excellent slides.

Abstract. The environment that surrounds us can be categorised into two parts, 
the natural environment and the built environment. Which ever environment 
type is to be maintained and / or enhanced for good, its sustainability has to be 
managed against obsolescence. From the built environment perspective, well 
more than half of whatever has been built and is being built, is going to be 
around for many decades to come. Thus, managing the sustainability of the 
existing built environment against obsolescence is of paramount importance. 
Keeping the focus on the built environment category, this paper establishes that 
sustainability and obsolescence are inversely related concepts. Furthermore, 
like sustainability, obsolescence is a multifaceted entity, thereby necessitating 
multimedia engagement of people/stakeholders, programs, technologies, 
equipment and other resources more than usual. Discussing the importance of 
the existing built environment, this paper presents a tool in the form of a 
conceptual but unified framework of sustainable obsolescence management. 
This framework can be used as fundamentals for further research in future to 
develop an intelligent multimedia architecture. Thus, the research work 
presented in this paper is at an initial stage of development of an intelligent 
multimedia system in a holistic format. 

Keywords: Sustainability; sustainable development; climate change;

1 Introduction 

The total environment that we live in can be divided into two main groups which are 
the natural environment and the built environment. In a mathematical equation this 
can be expressed as: 

E T = NE + BE Eq. 1A 

Or 
BE = E T - NE Eq. IB

Where: 

E T = Total Environment 
NE = Natural Environment 
BE = Built Environment 

The term built environment means human-made surroundings that provide a setting 
for human activity, ranging in scale from personal shelter to neighbourhoods and 
large scale-scale civic surroundings. Thus, whatever is human-made is the built 
environment. The built environment consists of two main parts which are buildings 
and infrastructures. The built environment density in an urban environment is more 
than in a rural environment. The biophysical properties of the urban environment are 
distinctive with a large building mass (350kg. m" 2 in dense residential areas) and 
associated heat storage capacity, reduced greenspace cover (with its evaporative 
cooling and rainwater interception and infiltration functions) and extensive surface 
sealing (around 70% in high density settlement and city centres) which promotes 
rapid runoff of precipitation (Handley, 2010). Climate change amplifies this 
distinctive behaviour by strengthening the urban heat island (Gill et. al. 2004). So it 
can be safely presumed as a general rule that the greater the density of a built 
environment, the greater the potential of the obsolescence, irrespective of drivers and 
reasons. For instance, London is one of the most urbanised parts of the UK built 
environment in terms of a range of elements such as geographical size, value, 
economy, human population, diversity, ecology and heritage. Furthermore, London is 
the capital of the UK and located near the North Sea, stretching around an estuary, 
with the River Thames running through it, thereby further adding significance and 
sensitivity to the city in a hydrological context e.g. increased potential of pluvial, 
fluvial, tidal and coastal floods. In view of these wide-ranging elements together, the 
overall London share in the total obsolescence to take place in the total UK built 
environment over time, is most probably to be larger than anywhere else in the UK, 
and probably one of the largest shares throughout the world. (Butt et. al., 2010a; 
2010b). 

Any constituent (such as a building or infrastructure) of a built environment grows 
to become obsolete or suffers increasing obsolescence over time. Moreover, what is 
being built now shall predominantly be around as a substantial part of our built 
environment for decades to come, which are bound to suffer various degrees of 
obsolescence in different ways (Butt et. al., 2010a; 2010b). In order to render our built 
environment more sustainable, obsolescence needs to be combated. There is a host of 
factors which play a role either alone or collectively to cause obsolescence. Examples 
of these factors are not only conventional such as aging, wear and tear, etc. but also, 
rather contemporary factors including energy consumption efficiency, environmental 
pressures such as reduction of carbon / greenhouse gases emissions, legislation / 
regulations, change of use, clean and waste water management, water quality and 
resources, land use, land contamination / soil quality, air emissions, changing 
occupier / end user demands, waste management, ecological concerns, health & 
safety, and climate change (Butt et. al. 2010a; 2010b). This host of aforesaid factors 
form part of sustainable development or sustainability concept. As evidence it can be 
seen that all such factors (directly and / or indirectly to various degrees) constitute 
National Sustainability Strategy and Headline Indicators of Sustainable Development 



Sustainable Obsolescence Management - A Conceptual Unified Framework 273 

in the UK as a whole, and even at state level i.e. Welsh and Scottish Headline 
Indicators (DEFRA, 2009; Munday and Roberts, 2006; Al Waer and Sibley, 2005; 
London SDC, 2005; Plows et. al., 2003; Scottish Parliament, 2002). Hence, there is a 
strong link between obsolescence and sustainability. 

In addition to the aforesaid list of factors that cause obsolescence and are building 
blocks of sustainable development philosophy, a new driver which is being 
increasingly realised is climate change. By 2050s the UK is expected to experience: 
increase in average summer mean temperatures (predicted to rise by up to 3.5Â°C) and 
frequency of heat-waves / very hot days; and increases in winter precipitation (of up 
to 20%) and possibly more frequent severe storms (Hulme et. al., 2002). Also, in 
2050s approximately 70% of UK buildings will have been built before 2010, which 
due to climate change factors (examples of which are indicated above) is already 
suffering and will further increasingly suffer from various types of obsolescence 
(Butt, et. al., 2010a; 2010b). Thus, if sustainable built environment is to accommodate 
climate change and the investment in these buildings (which was approximately Â£129 
billions in 2007 in the UK alone (UK Status online, 2007)) is to be protected, action 
needs to be taken now to assess and reduce likely obsolescence of the existing UK 
built environment; and plan adaptation and mitigation interventions, that continue to 
support the quality of life and well-being of UK citizens. Failure to act now will mean 
that the costs of tackling climate change associated obsolescence in future will be 
much higher (CBI, 2007). The situation with other countries around the globe is not 
dissimilar, although there may be some variation in nature and quantity of climate 
change, and the way climate change impacts manifest themselves in relation to the 
resources and governance of a given country. 

In order to render a given built asset more sustainable, implications of 
obsolescence and sustainability concepts need to be understood in relation to each 
other, rather than only as individually independent concepts. Sustainability or 
sustainable development is a multi-faceted philosophy with three main dimensions at 
the core it (described below in Section 2.0). Obsolescence is also multi-faceted but in 
opposite direction to that of sustainability. Keeping this in view, this paper outlines a 
conceptual unified framework of sustainable obsolescence management for built 
environments. There has been found no evidence of such a unified framework in the 
reported literature to date. Thus, the framework presented in this paper is an initial 
step of the research undertaken for the development of a holistic multimedia 
intelligent system for managing sustainability of built environments against 
obsolescence of any type, shape and size. 

2 Definitions 

2.1 Sustainability / Sustainable Development 

The word sustainability is derived from the Latin (tenere, to hold; sus, up). 
Dictionaries provide a number of meanings but main ones being to 'maintain', 
'support', or 'endure'. (Onions, 1964; Dictionary.com, 2010a). In built environment 
context, these are exactly the meanings which apply, i.e. built environment needs to 



274 T.E. Butt, J.C. Cooper, and K.G. Jones 

be maintained, supported, and made endurable to obsolescence against a whole host 
of factors that cause obsolescence (indicated in the Introduction Section above). 

The Sustainability philosophy comprises three main dimensions which are Social 
(S) or Ethics (E), Environment (E) and Economics (E). These can be abbreviated as 
SEE or EEE. Although, sustainability as an individual concept, in its own right, has 
many definitions, meanings and implications, has been most diverse and still one of 
the most rapidly growing concepts; this research study is focusing on obsolescence 
versus sustainability only from the perspective of built environment. 

2.2 Obsolescence 

In English language the word 'obsolescence' means the process of becoming 
obsolete; falling into disuse or becoming out of date; being in the process of passing 
out of use or usefulness. In other words, obsolescence is the state of being which 
occurs when a person, object, or service is no longer wanted even though it may still 
be in good working order (Word Net, 2010; Butt et. al, 2010a; 2010b; 
Dictionary.com; 2010b; Hornby and Cowie, 1989). 

In the context of built environment, obsolescence can be defined as depreciation in 
value and / or usefulness of a built asset (or its individual units or components) due to 
an impairment of desirability and / or function caused by new inventions, current 
changes in design, change in technology, improved process of production, change in 
use or end-user demands, other social factors like instability in politics of a country or 
tightening of environmental legislation that make a property or built asset less 
desirable and valuable for a continued use. (Cooper, 2004; Montgomery Law, 2010; 
Leeper Appraisal Services, 2010; Richmond Virginia Real Estate, 2003; Nky Condo 
Rentals, 2010: SMA Financing, 2009). 

3 Sustainability versus Obsolescence - Built Environment Context 

With reference to Sections 1.0 and 2.0, factors which cause obsolescence are in fact 
the ones which cause 'unsustainability' . These, factors need to be managed in order to 
render a given built environment sustainable. The more these factors are mismanaged, 
the more the obsolescence and correspondingly the less the sustainability. Thus, 
obsolescence and sustainability are inversely associated (further explained below with 
examples). This new insight is presented with a conceptual graph below. However, 
for a specific obsolescence factor the relationship may not necessarily be always 
linear it but exponential with varying degrees. However, this paper is drawing 
knowledge only in conceptual context, therefore, for simplicity a linear conceptual 
graph is selected. Some examples are described below to demonstrate that 
sustainability and obsolescence are opposite to each other along all the three 
dimensions of sustainable development philosophy i.e. social, environmental and 
economic. 



Sustainable Obsolescence Management - A Conceptual Unified Framework 275 




Time (e.g. years) 

Fig. 1. A conceptual graph of inverse relationship between sustainability and obsolescence 

3.1 Social 

Consider a built environment scenario as follows: There is a food processing factory 
which also includes cooking and other processes which involves heating, thus, fuel 
burning activities. To dissipate emissions from burning a small chimney is used for 
there are no developments around. Due to lack of land availability, suppose the 
relevant authority approves construction application of building residential and / or 
commercial properties in the area. Now, as the human population increases in the area 
over time, the same chimney size and diffusion efficiency may not be enough for the 
locality. The people in the area may start objecting to chimney's emissions and ashes 
not being diffused in the air high enough. Thus, the current system would begin to 
become obsolete and correspondingly sustainability will be reducing in social / ethical 
context. The same situation also applies to noise pollution, if any. This example 
shows that social obsolescence is opposite of social sustainability of a given built 
environment. 

3.2 Environmental 



Consider a built environment setting which contains residential, commercial and light 
industrial developments. All of these produce domestic / municipal, commercial and 
industrial wastes, respectively, but there is no sustainable waste management strategy 
and practice in place. This means, the community is inclined to consume virgin 
materials and for waste materials not being reused and / or recycled, the ecological 
footprint of the community is even higher. Due to growing environmental protection 
issues, the built environment's current systems and practices regarding waste 
management (i.e. the current waste management infrastructure) will begin to 
increasingly become obsolete. This increase in degree of environmental obsolescence 
simply means corresponding reduction in environmental sustainability, which 



276 T.E. Butt, J.C. Cooper, and K.G. Jones 

indicates that the two entities, i.e. sustainability and obsolescence, are inversely linked 
on environmental grounds. 

3.3 Economic 

Consider a densely built environment in a place where water supplies are metered. 
Thus, water costs are in proportion to the amount consumed. Substantial amount of 
precipitation occurs each year in the area. Still rain water instead of being harnessed 
for reuse and / or recycle is simply wasted to public sewers. For water consumption, 
water is used only from the main supply. Due to inflation and increase in water rates, 
over time, this method of water consumption may become less and less sustainable on 
economic grounds. This, would also mean that economic obsolescence will begin to 
be induced in the current (unsustainable) water management system and escalate over 
time. This is how sustainability and obsolescence are inversely related in economic 
context of sustainable development philosophy. 

4 Holistic Sustainable Obsolescence Management 

In this section of the paper, a unified framework of a holistic intelligent system is 
developed in the form of a tool which interacts between the three fundamental 
dimensions of sustainability (i.e. social, economic and environment), where people, 
programs, technologies, equipment and other resources can be engaged in a 
multimedia environment. The framework is currently at conceptual stage of 
development in the research project undertaken at the University of Greenwich and 
depicted in Figure 2. The framework provides a foundation which takes account of 
various aspects of the three principal dimensions of sustainability particularly at the 
cost-benefit analysis stage, where all such aspects interact to assist evidence-based 
decision making thereby drawing a best compromise between various aspects of 
social, environmental and economic dimensions in order to manage obsolescence 
sustainably. 

Although the whole framework has multifaceted features and multimedia 
engagement from various stakeholders, but particularly at the cost-benefit analysis 
stage of the framework this becomes very evident where inputs from diverse technical 
to non-technical stakeholders are put together to analyse as a multimedia interaction 
to yield a most sustainable solution. However, since computing technology has 
enhanced traditional information technologies many folds, therefore as a future 
research potential, once this framework is converted into a detailed computer-aided 
intelligent system, then particularly the CBA stage will provide a computer-aided 
multimedia architecture where the framework would be more readily useable by built 
asset managers and other relevant decision makers both in maintenance as well as 
refurbishment. 

All the items in the framework are shadowed under technical, non-technical, 
physical and / or non-physical aspects. The contributing proportions of these four 
aspects for items in the framework will vary from scenario to scenario of built 
environment, depending upon a number of characteristics such as nature, size, scope, 
and type of the component under consideration. Examples of technical aspects are 



Sustainable Obsolescence Management - A Conceptual Unified Framework 277 

heating systems; limitations of technologies (such as non-energy saver i.e. 
conventional lighting bulbs); etc. Whereas, the behaviour of occupants and 
maintenance staff of a commercial building; energy using patterns of dwellers of a 
house; etc. are examples of non-technical aspects. Examples of physical aspects are 
fabric of buildings; facade of buildings; furniture; etc. Whereas for non-physical the 
following can be taken as examples: energy; ventilation; maintenance or 
refurbishment schedule; etc. Among various items in the holistic structure (Figure 2), 
some would be physical, some non-physical, some technical, some non-technical, and 
some could be various combinations of any four of these aspects. This will depend on 
various characteristics specific to a given built environment scenario under 
consideration. For instance, natural lighting is non-physical but may have aspects that 
are associated with physical design of the building or non-physical phenomenon such 
as summer sun or winter sun. Similarly, environmental legislation (e.g. the Climate 
Change Act 2008; 2010 (DECC, 2010a; 2010b; HM, 2010)) regarding carbon cuts is a 
non-technical entity but may have technical aspects integrated when carbon cut 
technologies (e.g. carbon capture and storage) are employed to a fossil-fuel power 
generation plant. Also, the heating system of a building is a physical commodity, but 
energy consumption efficiency in terms of users' behaviour is non-physical aspect 
and the employed heating technology is a technical matter. Management systems 
(such as maintenance schedule; environmental management system e.g. ISO 14000; 
quality management system e.g. ISO 9000, etc.) are non-physical matters but may 
have technical as well as non-technical aspects associated with them. 

Obsolescence management can be described as a process of analysis, evaluation, 
control and organisation of obsolescence for a given built environment scenario. 
Figure 2 depicts the conceptual framework as a basis of a holistic multimedia system 
of sustainable obsolescence management, where people/stakeholders, technologies, 
maintenance and refurbishment programs, equipment and other resources can 
sequentially and categorically interact to help control obsolescence of existing built 
assets. The framework consists of two main parts i.e. Obsolescence Assessment (OA) 
and Obsolescence Reduction (OR). The output of OA is input to OR and this is how 
the former provides basis for the latter. Therefore, the more robust and stronger the 
foundation yielded from OA, the more effective the OR is likely to be. 

4.1 Obsolescence Assessment (OA) 

OA consists of two sub-parts i.e. baseline study and, Identification and categorisation. 
In the baseline study section of the framework an obsolescence assessor is to gather 
relevant information by carrying out a desk study of various documents such as 
drawings, engineering design, historic data on various aspects e.g. flooding, etc. This 
information can be reinforced by paying investigative visits to the site and gathering 
anecdotes. The baseline study can also play a vital role of screening before scoping is 
carried out in a later stage of the framework. Based on the information collected, the 
assessor can identify and categorise various items under a set of two headings i.e. 
built environment constituents (BEC) and obsolescence nature (Figure 2).

Sustainable Obsolescence Management - A Conceptual Unified Framework 279 

4.1.1 Built Environment Constituents (BEC) 

In the BEC module, scope or boundaries can be established of a given built 
environment. For instance, whether it is a building or infrastructure; what is the type 
of building (e.g. commercial, domestic, industrial, etc.); what is the type of 
infrastructure e.g. transport (and if transport then road network or buses in specific; 
railway networks or trains themselves); energy generation or distribution network; 
etc. At this point, it can also be established whether it is an existing or a future 
development. The stage of a development can also be further broken down along the 
following steps: planning, construction, in-operation and / or decommissioning. 
Sometimes it may be the extension of an already existing building which is being 
planned, constructed or decommissioned. Therefore, it is better to identify whether 
planning, construction, in-operation and / or decommissioning are in full or in part. 
After this, the assessor can break down the given built environment under 
consideration into all constituting components. These components can then be 
characterised along facets such as operational, non-operational, physical, non- 
physical, technical, non-technical, socio-technical, managerial, non-managerial, 
fabric, non-fabric, etc. 

4.1.2 Obsolescence Nature 

The next main stage in the framework is identification and categorisation of 
obsolescence nature for the specified components (Figure 2). The nature of the 
obsolescence can be characterised as follows: Financial obsolescence means loss in 
value where as functional obsolescence is loss of usefulness, effectiveness, efficiency 
or productivity. The financial obsolescence is also termed as social or economic 
obsolescence, and functional obsolescence as technical obsolescence. (Cooper, 2004; 
Montgomery Law, 2010; Leeper Appraisal Services, 2010; Richmond Virginia Real 
Estate, 2003; Nky Condo Rentals, 2010: SMA Financing, 2009). Irrespective of 
whether obsolescence is in value or function or both, internal obsolescence in a 
building component or built asset is due to factors that exist within the component or 
built asset. For instance, general wear and tear, fatigue, corrosion, oxidation, 
evaporation, rusting, leaking of gas / water or any other fluid like coolant, breaking, 
age, etc. Where as external obsolescence is temporary or permanent impairment in 
value or usefulness of a built asset due to factors outside the system such as change in 
existing or advent of a new environmental legislation; social forces / pressure groups; 
arrival of new technology; improvement or enhancement of knowledge; fluctuation in 
demand; inflation of currency; etc. (Landmark Properties, 2009; Salt Lake County, 
2004; ESD Appraisal Services, 2010; Drew Mortgage, 2006). Permanent 
obsolescence is irreversible, for instance materials in buildings that contain asbestos 
have become permanently obsolete due to its adverse health impacts. On the contrary, 
factors which are not permanent such as temporary civil unrest in a society, loss of 
power for days, flooding, etc. can cause a temporary obsolescence. 

Similarly, Irrespective of whether an obsolescence is internal or external and 
financial or functional, if a given obsolescence is due to impacts of climate change 
(e.g. more intense and more frequent rainfall, stronger and more frequent hurricanes, 
heat-wave, flooding, etc.) is referred to as climate change induced obsolescence by 
the authors (Butt et. al., 2010a; 2010b). If obsolescence is independent of climate 
change impacts, then it is called non-climate change related obsolescence. However, 



280 T.E. Butt, J.C. Cooper, and K.G. Jones 

if obsolescence is climate change related, then it could be either directly climate 
change related or indirectly climate change related. Obsolescence that is caused by 
direct impact of climate change factors is termed as directly induced climate change 
obsolescence. For instance, current air conditioning systems in our built environment 
may not be as effective due to global warming / heat-waves which are a resultant of 
climate change. Thus global warming / heat-waves may bring about obsolescence in a 
given building's air conditioning system as a direct impact. These heat-waves can also 
have direct adverse affects on the structure or fabric of buildings. Obsolescence that 
results from the impact of climate change factors in an indirect manner is referred to 
as indirectly induced climate change obsolescence. For example, irrespective of the 
degree, one of the reasons of climate change acceleration is anthropogenic activities 
such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions which include carbon dioxide. This has 
contributed in shaping environmental legislation such as European Union (EU) 
Directive of Energy Performance of Buildings (2002/91/EC) (EU, 2002; EC, 2010); 
EU Climate and Energy objectives; and legally binding carbon reduction targets set 
up by Climate Change Act 2008 (DECC, 2010a; 2010b). Such environmental 
legislations have begun to cause indirectly induced climate change obsolescence in 
existing buildings. 

4.2 Obsolescence Reduction (OR) 

As stated earlier, the second main part of the sustainable obsolescence management is 
OR. Although the whole of the obsolescence management framework may be iterated 
a number of times depending on various characteristics of a given built environment 
scenario, this part of the holistic framework certainly needs repeating a number of 
times until most sustainable and yet realistically possible solution or set of solutions 
have been derived and implemented. The Obsolescence Assessment (OA) is 
predominantly around gathering and categorisation of data and information of the 
given built environment, which does not need much iteration. However, as for Or, the 
main reason for repeating the OR more frequently is that various modules in this part 
are mutually dependent on each other for mutual information transfer. This is due to 
the fact that information processed in various OR modules have to be delivered and 
received between the modules backwards and forwards a number of times. For 
instance, the information between cost-benefit analysis and stakeholder participation 
modules has to be used backwards and forwards due to various sustainability aspects 
as well as variation in interests among different stake holders (Figure 2). This 
iteration aspect becomes clearer in the discussion below where various modules of the 
OR part are described in more details. This part has been divided into two sub-parts 
i.e. Obsolescence Evaluation (OE) and Obsolescence Control (OC). Details on them 
are described below: 

4.2.1 Obsolescence Evaluation (OE) 

The first unit in the OE section is 'selection of component(s)' module. Based on the 
information which would have been collated earlier in the OA part of the OM, in this 
module the components of the built environment scenario, which are the point of 
interest in terms of obsolescence assessment and management, can be identified and 
categorised. In order to assist prioritisation and selection of the components, this 



Sustainable Obsolescence Management - A Conceptual Unified Framework 281 

module categorises the identified components into three groups based on the rationale 
around various sustainability aspects. These three groups are: 

1 . The components which have become obsolescent; 

2. The components which are nearing end of life; and 

3. The components which have sufficient life. 

There is a module allocated for establishing positive and negative impacts of both 
taking action and not taking action to fix the obsolescence problems, particularly 
those of from the first two groups above. This can help to further prioritise on which 
components need more and quick attention as opposed to others. Following this, there 
is another module in the framework where all possible options to control 
obsolescence can be identified and their characteristics (both advantages and 
limitations) can be established. These options could be technical (e.g. some 
innovative technology); non-technical (such as a new managerial system to control 
behaviour of energy consumption); or even combinations of technical and non- 
technical facets with varying proportions. This information on various options can 
later also feed into the 'cost-benefit analysis' module, which is divided into three sub- 
modules to address the three principal dimensions of sustainable development 
philosophy. These three sub-modules are: Social, Environment and Economic. Each 
of the social and environment sub-modules cover sustainability aspects in two 
categories, which are financial costs and non-financial costs. For the social sub- 
module, examples of financial costs are fine that a company may face due to not 
complying with some legislation requirements such as health and safety regulations; 
compensation which might have to be paid to the relevant stakeholder e.g. an 
employee who suffers a health problem or an accident at work; compensation might 
have to be paid to an external customer too; etc. Where as adverse impact on 
company image, quality of service or product of the company, poor social corporate 
responsibility, are examples of non-financial aspects. Similarly for the environment 
sub-module, lets consider a case in which some spillage of a toxic substance takes 
place due to some improper or obsolete component. This can cause financial costs 
such as the cost to fix the environmental damage and compensation to the victims of 
the environmental damage. Whereas the bad publicity and extra-ordinarily high 
pressures from the government bodies (e.g. the Environment Agency) as well as 
various voluntary environmental pressure groups are examples of non-financial 
environmental costs . For the economic sub-module there are three categories which 
are: 

1 . capital cost, 

2. running cost, and 

3. payback time. 

In the first two categories above, costs of refitting (i.e. maintenance) and / or 
retrofitting (i.e. refurbishment) of the selected components are to be analysed. The 
payback time will also play a vital role in decision making. The financial costs of 
environmental and social aspects can also be tapped into the economics sub-module to 
draw a bigger picture of total costs. Thus, economic sub-module is shown connected 



282 T.E. Butt, J.C. Cooper, and K.G. Jones 

with financial costs of the social and environmental sub-modules (Figure 1). The cost- 
benefit analysis can be reinforced by consulting diverse spectrum of (internal and 
external) stakeholders ranging from technical to non-technical. Each and every 
stakeholder needs not to be consulted for each and every obsolescence scenario but 
only appropriate and relevant stakeholders depending on characteristics of the scenario. 
Thus, in the 'stakeholder participation' module of the framework, appropriate 
stakeholders should also be identified prior to consultation. Information from the 'other 
evaluations' module regarding e.g. feasibility report, the company's policy and mission 
statement, etc., can also be tapped into the cost-benefit analysis module to render it 
more holistic. Eventually, in the decision making module, a decision is made in terms 
selection of an option or a set of options to reduce impacts of the obsolescence in the 
built environment scenario. 

4.2.2 Obsolescence Control (OC) 

In the OC section of the sustainable obsolescence management framework, the 
selected obsolescence control option(s) is/are designed and planned. If any 
unexpected implications, these can be reconsulted with the appropriate stakeholders 
and rechecked via the cost-benefit analysis module. If any problems, another option 
or set of options can be selected and then designed and planned again. Such iterations 
can continue till a satisfactory option or set of options has/have been designed and 
planned, following which the option(s) can be implemented. While implementing 
monitoring needs to take place for if there are any discrepancies. Frequency of 
monitoring can also be incorporated into the system at the design and planning stages 
earlier. If any discrepancies observed, corrective actions need to be taken to control 
the implementation process. Such corrective actions against discrepancies can also be 
set during the design and planning stage. 

5 Concluding Remarks 

This paper establishes link between sustainability and obsolescence. The elements 
which are associated with sustainability, the same elements are associated with 
obsolescence but in the opposite direction. Based on this fact, the paper establishes that 
like sustainability, obsolescence is also multifaceted and sustainable management of 
obsolescence means an equally holistic multimedia architecture is needed where all 
various resources from people / stakeholders to information and technologies have a 
multimedia interaction along the three fundamental dimensions of sustainability 
philosophy i.e. social, economic and environmental aspects. This paper presents such a 
holistic framework which forms fundamentals of an intelligent multimedia interaction 
model, where all sustainability aspects are taken into account particularly at the cost- 
benefit analysis stage to create an environment for evidence-based decision-making. 

The multimedia conceptual framework is developed in a holistic fashion for the 
sustainable obsolescence management to cover all appropriate modules and sub- 
modules from the start to the end. Obsolescence types and obsolescence drivers also 
identified and categorised to ease interaction of various modules and sub-modules of the 
framework. The framework is specific to the built environment and is able to deal with 
built environment scenarios whether fully or partly at planning, construction, in- 



Sustainable Obsolescence Management - A Conceptual Unified Framework 283 

operation and / or decommissioning stage. The physical, non-physical, technical and 
non-technical aspects are also included. This renders the framework useful for diverse 
range of stakeholders from experts and technical to non-experts and non-technical, 
respectively. This research work is a step towards making obsolescence management 
possible in a holistic and sustainable manner. This research work can also streamline 
current practices of obsolescence management which are available in a non-integrated 
and peace-meal fashion, and to a limited extent. This framework can attract debate and 
interests from both practitioners and researchers for further study and research, and later 
be converted into a computer-aided intelligent multimedia system. However, the 
framework, in its current shape can still be effectively used as a decision making tool to 
select an option or set of options to assess and manage obsolescence in a sustainable 
manner based on cost-benefit analysis. Thereby, assisting in rendering our existing built 
environment (which will be around for many decades to come) more sustainable against 
various obsolescence drivers from conventional to as modern factors as climate change.

Abstract. By appearance of social media, people are coming to be able to trans- 
mit information easily on a personal level. However, because users of social me- 
dia generally spend little time on describing information, low-quality texts are 
transmitted and it blocks the spread of information. On transmitted texts in social 
media, commas and linefeeds are inserted incorrectly, and it becomes a factor 
of low-quality texts. This paper proposes a method for automatically formatting 
Japanese texts in social media. Our method formats texts by inserting commas 
and linefeeds appropriately. In our method, the positions where commas and line- 
feeds should be inserted are decided based on machine learning using morpho- 
logical information, dependency relation and clause boundary information. An 
experiment using Japanese spoken language texts has shown the effectiveness of 
our method. 



1 Introduction 

Recently, social media such as Facebook, Twitter and blog service are appearing. Face- 
book has over five hundred million users, and Twitter has over one hundred million 
users. By using social media, those users can spread information easily to people all 
over the world through interaction on a personal level. However, users generally spend 
little time on describing information in social media because they want easy transmis- 
sion of information, unlike those in newspaper or TV broadcast. Therefore, the trans- 
mitted texts tend to be low-quality. Low-quality texts might prevent information from 
spreading in social media. 

This paper proposes a method for automatically formatting Japanese texts in social 
media. Our method formats texts by inserting commas and linefeeds at proper positions. 
On transmitted texts in social media, too many or too few commas are often inserted or 
proper linefeed insertion may not be done, and it becomes a factor of low-quality texts. 
However, commas and linefeeds play important roles in the readability of texts. 

In our method, first, commas are inserted into a Japanese text, and then, linefeeds are 
inserted into the text into which commas were inserted. The comma insertion method

decides whether or not to insert a comma at each bunsetsu^ boundary by machine learn- 
ing. The linefeed insertion is also executed by the similar technique. 

We conducted an experiment on comma and linefeed insertion using Japanese spo- 
ken language data and confirmed the effectiveness of our method. 

2 Text Formatting by Comma and Linefeed Insertion 

In social media, while users can transmit information easily, users spend little time on 
describing information. Therefore, the transmitted texts tend to be low-quality. Auto- 
matic text formatting is desired so that texts become easy to read. 

As related works, there have been researches on automatic text summarization (TJ, 
conversion of spoken language into written language 1 2] and conversion of spoken doc- 
uments into web documents [3|. In these works, text formatting is realized by editing 
strings in the texts. However, it is important not only to be written in simple words or 
simple structure, but also to be displayed properly so that texts are easy to read. 

In our work, we focus on comma and linefeed insertion as the method for text for- 
matting. For Japanese, which is a non-segmented language, it is necessary to segment 
texts properly by commas and linefeeds so that the texts are easy to read. 

2.1 Text Formatting by Comma Insertion 

There are several usages of commas such as making clear sentence structures or mark- 
ing word boundaries, and the positions where commas are inserted depend on these 
usages. It is important to insert commas at proper positions in accordance with the us- 
ages of commas. However, while there is a tendency about the positions where commas 
should be inserted, there is no clear standard for these positions. Therefore, positions 
where commas are inserted could be different in individuals. In social media, texts into 
which commas were inserted incorrectly are created. Because such texts become hard 
to read, it is required to format these texts by inserting commas at proper positions. 

Newspaper articles are one of the texts into which commas were inserted properly. 
Examples of a text in newspaper articles are shown below: 

h.flX^Z>bW\^\C, Slt&flllfcUJff LTV^o (In Asia, which becomes 
a center of the growth of the world, the strong presence of China not only brings 
hope but also causes difficult problems.) 

fÂ£ V ^tM fiÂ± # V \ (The United Nations should play a lot of roles in a broad 
range of fields, such as the global environment, population, and food.) 

It is possible to improve the readability of web texts by inserting commas at positions 
where commas are inserted in newspaper articles. 



1 Bunsetsu is a linguistic unit in Japanese that roughly corresponds to a basic phrase in English. 
A bunsetsu consists of one independent word and zero or more ancillary words. 



Automatic Text Formatting for Social Media Based on Linefeed and Comma Insertion 287 

2.2 Text Formatting by Linefeed Insertion 

In order to generate readable texts, it is important how to display texts. In the text in 
FigureQ] how to display is not considered, and linefeeds are forcibly inserted according 
to the width. Therefore, the text is not easy to read. In fact, such the texts are written 
in newspaper articles because newspaper have space constraints. On the other hand, 
the space constraints are not so hard on the web. Therefore, to display texts into which 
linefeeds are inserted appropriately is effective. 

By inserting linefeeds at semantic boundaries, the texts become easy to read. 
Figure|2]shows the text into which linefeeds are inserted at proper positions. Linefeeds 
are inserted at the semantic boundary HK^/^fc 5 A/~Â£~f~tttl if' t> (are connected)" and 
right after the subject of the sentence iXW, h V "> 5 Â© fi (the situation)".

3 Text Formatting Method 

Our method formats texts by inserting commas and linefeeds appropriately. In social 
media, texts into which commas and linefeeds are inserted incorrectly can be created. 
Therefore, our method ignores these inserted commas and linefeeds, and inserts com- 
mas and linefeeds into texts which have no commas and linefeeds. 

In our method, we use the comma insertion method [4| and the linefeed insertion 
method [5|. Figure [3] shows an example of text formatting by our method. First, our 
method inserts commas into a Japanese sentence, and then, inserts linefeeds so that the 
number of characters in each line can be less than or equal to the maximum number of 
characters per line. 



3.1 Comma Insertion Method 

In comma insertion method, a sentence, on which morphological analysis, bunsetsu seg- 
mentation, clause boundary analysis and dependency analysis have been performed, is 



A dependency in Japanese is a modification relation in which a modifier bunsetsu depends on 
a modified bunsetsu. That is, the modifier bunsetsu and the modified bunsetsu work as modifier 
and modifyee, respectively.

considered the input. Our method decides whether or not to insert a comma at each 
bunsetsu boundary in an input sentence. Comma insertion method identifies the most 
appropriate combination among all combinations of positions where a comma can be 
inserted, by using the probabilistic model. 

In this paper, input sentences which consist of n bunsetsus are represented by B = 
b\--- b n , and the results of comma insertion by R = r\ â  â  â  r n . Here, r, is 1 if a comma 
is inserted right after bunsetsu Â£>,, and otherwise. Also, r n = 1. We indicate the j- 
th sequence of bunsetsus created by dividing an input sentence into m sequences as 
Lj = b\ â  â  â  b n . ( 1 < j <m), and then, r' k = if 1 < k < rij, and r' k = 1 if k = rij. 



3.1.1 Probabilistic Model for Comma Insertion 

When an input sentence B is provided, our method identifies the comma insertion R that 
maximizes the conditional probability P(R\B). Assuming that whether or not to insert a 
comma right after a bunsetsu is independent of other commas except the one appearing 
immediately before that bunsetsu, P(R\B) can be calculated as follows: 



P(R\B)

3.1.2 Features on Maximum Entropy Method 

To estimate P{r{ = 1 (r^ = 0, â¢ â¢ â¢ , r[ = 0, ^T 1 , = 1,B) and P(/-( = 0|#^_ 1 = 0, â¢ â¢ â¢ , r[ = 

0,nl~.i = 1,-B) by the maximum entropy method, we used the features in TableQ] To 
decide the features, we grouped the usages of commas, and investigated the appearance 
tendency for each category by using Japanese newspaper articles. For more details, 
please refer to the literature Q . 

3.2 Linefeed Insertion Method 

We adopt the same method as comma insertion for linefeed insertion. A sentence, on 
which morphological analysis, bunsetsu segmentation, clause boundary analysis and 
dependency analysis have been performed, is considered the input. Linefeed insertion 
method decides whether or not to insert a linefeed at each bunsetsu boundary in an 
input sentence. Under the construction that the number of characters in each line has 
to be less than or equal to the maximum number of characters per line, linefeed in- 
sertion method identifies the most appropriate combination among all combinations of

features were decided based on an analysis of linefeed data. For more details, please 
refer to the literature [5|. 

4 Experiment 

We conducted an experiment on inserting commas and linefeeds. We assume that our 
method can be used to format various types of texts. In the experiment, we evaluate the 
effectiveness of our method by using Japanese spoken language data. 

4.1 Outline of Experiment 

As the experimental data, we used the Japanese spoken language texts in the SIDB [6]. 
All the data were annotated with information on morphological analysis, dependency 
analysis and clause boundary detection by hand. The correct data of comma and line- 
feed insertion were created by inserting commas and linefeeds properly into this data 
by hand. Table [3] shows the size of the correct data. We performed a 16-fold cross- 
validation experiment by using this data. However, since we used 221 sentences among 
1,935 sentences as the analysis data in our research |5], we evaluated the experimental 
result for the other 1,714 sentences (20,707 bunsetsus). Here, we used the maximum 
entropy method tool (7). As for options, the repeat count on learning algorithm is set to 
2000, and other options are set to default. In the experiment, we defined the maximum 
number of characters per line as 20.

As shown in Figure|4j readable texts have been generated by our method. 



4.3 Discussion 

In this subsection, we focus on the relation between positions where commas were 
inserted and positions where linefeeds were inserted in the evaluation data. 

Among positions where a comma existed (4,046 positions) and positions where a 
linefeed existed (5,042 positions) in the evaluation data, there existed 2,519 positions 
where a comma and a linefeed were existed. Table|5]shows the recall of comma insertion

Table 5. Recalls at positions where a comma and a linefeed existed in the evaluation data 



linefeeds 



79.24% (1,996/2,519) 



87.89% (2,214/2,519) 



and the recall of linefeed insertion at these positions. Each recall was higher than the 
recall shown in Table [4] This is because positions where a comma and a linefeed are 
inserted may be semantic boundaries, and, our features can capture these positions well. 
Also, there existed 1 ,527 positions where only a comma existed, and the recall at these 
positions was 59.14% (903/1,527). And, there existed 2,467 positions where only a 
linefeed existed, and the recall at these positions was 65.95% (1,664/2,523). Each recall 
was lower than the recall shown in Table [4] 

Among positions where commas existed in the evaluation data, there existed 462 
positions where our method inserted linefeeds incorrectly. In case that linefeeds are 
inserted at positions where commas existed in the evaluation data, short lines will be 
generated unnecessarily and the texts will become hard to read. On the other hand, 
among positions where linefeeds existed in the evaluation data, there existed 273 posi- 
tions where our method inserted commas incorrectly. Commas inserted too much harm 
readability of the texts. Because our method inserts commas and linefeeds sequentially, 
our method cannot consider linefeeds when our method decides whether or not to insert 
a comma. To realize more flexible comma and linefeed insertion, to develop a method 
which inserts commas and linefeeds at the same time is desired. 



5 Conclusion 

This paper proposed a method for formatting Japanese texts in social media. Our met- 
hod formats texts by inserting commas and linefeeds at proper positions. In our method, 
commas and linefeeds are inserted into a sentence by machine learning, based on the 
information such as morpheme, dependencies and clause boundaries. An experiment by 
using Japanese spoken language data showed F-measure of comma insertion was 76.07 
and F-measure of linefeed insertion was 72.85, and we confirmed the effectiveness of 
our method. 

Our method identifies positions where commas are inserted first, and then, inserts 
linefeeds. Therefore, our method cannot judge a bunsetsu boundary as a position where 
a comma and a linefeed are inserted, or where a comma is not inserted but a linefeed 
is inserted at the same time. However, humans would not insert commas and linefeeds 
sequentially. In the future, we will develop more flexible method which inserts commas 
and linefeeds at the same time.

Abstract. Towards building new, friendlier human-computer interac- 
tion and multimedia interactive services systems, new computer tech- 
niques are applied which aim at revealing information about the affective 
state, cognitive activity, personality, intention and psychological state of 
a person. In this paper we conduct a survey on systems which attempt 
to recognize human emotion from body movements and/or hand/arm 
gestures. Our survey shows that, although there are a lot of researches 
on human tracking, human motion analysis and gesture analysis, there 
are not many researches regarding emotion recognition from body move- 
ments and gestures. Moreover, there is a lack of databases depicting 
human movements and/or hand gestures in different states of emotions. 



1 Introduction 

With the progress of computer vision and multimedia technologies, there has 
been much interest in motion understanding. Human motion analysis is currently 
one of the most active research fields in computer vision. The aim is to detect, 
track and identify people, and more generally, to interpret human behaviors, 
from image sequences involving humans. A significant part of this task consists 
of capturing large scale body movements, such as movements of the head, arms, 
torso, and legs. For this reason and because of the similarities (i.e., both involve 
articulated structures and non-rigid motions, same techniques are used towards 
both tasks, etc.) gesture analysis can be considered as a part of human motion 
analysis. D. M. Gavrila 1 identified this research field as "looking at people" and 
presented some of the most important areas that this research can be applied 
on with promising results, which as summarized in Table [TJ 

Although there are a lot of researches on human tracking, human motion 
analysis and gesture analysis, there are only quite a few researches regarding 
emotion recognition from body movements and gestures. The majority of these 
approaches have appeared in the last decade and aim at facilitating human 
computer interaction by adding the ability to the computers to recognize the 
users' emotional states. 

In this paper we conduct a survey on these approaches, which can be divided 
in two categories: studies in emotion recognition from body movements and/or 
hand/arm gestures which were part of a multimodal emotion recognition system

and, (2) independent studies emotion recognition from body movements and/or 
hand/arm gestures. The studies are compared in terms of the emotion classes, 
classification rate, use or non use of markers and the type of the movements 
that are being classified (stylized or non-stylized). Specifically, in Chapter [2] 
we describe the studies which try to recognize the emotion from body move- 
ments or hand/arm gestures independently, whereas in Chapter [5] we present 
the multimodal emotion recognition systems which use body movements and/or 
hand/arm gestures. Finally, we conclude and point to future work. 



2 Emotion Recognition Systems from Body Movements 
and/or Hand/Arm Gestures 

These systems try to recognize the emotional state of a person from the move- 
ments or the posture of the body as well as the movements of the hands or arms 
|2I3I4I5I6I7I8| . Specifically, Bianchi-Berthouze and Kleinsmith [2 addressed the 
issue of adding the capability to robots to recognize the affective state of the 
human by interpreting their gestural cues. To achieve that, they used an associa- 
tive neural network called categorizing and learning module (CALM) [S|, which 
incorporates brain-like structural and functional constraints such as modularity 
and organization with excitatory and inhibitory connections. To evaluate their 



Emotion Recognition from Body Movements and Gestures 297 

proposed framework, they collected emotional gestures with a VICON motion 
capture system. Twelve subjects of different gender, race and age were asked 
to perform as actors for the experiment. Dressed in a suit with 34 markers lo- 
cated on the joints and segments of his/her body, each subject performed an 
in-place freely decided emotional gesture. The total set consisted of 138 gestures 
depicting the following emotions: 'anger', 'happiness' and 'sadness'. The CALM 
network achieved a performance of 95,7% in classifying the emotions. 

Bernhardt and Robinson [3] developed a computational model for describing 
and detecting affective content in everyday body movements. In their approach, 
they divided complex motions into a set of automatically derived motion primi- 
tives and, then, analyzed each primitive in terms of dynamic features which were 
shown to encode affective information. They also developed an algorithm to de- 
rive unbiased motion features adapted to personal movement idiosyncrasies, for 
persons already in the database. In order to classify the emotional states, they 
developed a SVM-based classifier and tested by applying Leave-One-Subject-Out 
cross-validation (LOSO-CV) tests. The system achieved 50% and 81% classifi- 
cation rates for biased and unbiased features, respectively. 

Camurri et al. |4l5j explored the classification of expressive gesture in human 
full-body movement and in particular in dance performances. Their system con- 
sisted of four layers. In the first layer, they analyzed the video and movement 
(techniques for background subtraction, motion detection, motion tracking etc.). 
In the second layer, they computed the low-level features by applying computer 
vision techniques on the incoming images and computing statistical measures. 
In the third layer, they computed mid-level features and maps, e.g. gesture seg- 
mentation and representation of gestures as trajectories in semantic spaces (e.g., 
Laban's Effort space, energy-articulation space). In the final (fourth) layer, they 
classified the movement in four emotional classes, namely : 'anger', 'fear', 'joy' 
and 'grief. For the classification step, they first used statistical techniques by 
computing a one-way AN OVA for each motion cue [I]. Later, they developed de- 
cision tree models for better results [5] . They developed five decision tree models, 
which achieved different performance among the various emotional states. They 
compared the system performance towards the classification accuracy of human 
spectators. Human spectators managed to classify the emotion with 56% accu- 
racy, while the system achieved a 40% accuracy. 

More recently, Castellano et al. |6] presented an approach for the recognition 
of acted emotional states from the body movements and gesture expressivity. 
Their approach was based on the fact that distinct emotions are often associ- 
ated with different qualities of body movement. In order to classify the emotion, 
they used non-propositional movement qualities (e.g. amplitude, speed and flu- 
idity of movement) to infer emotions, rather than trying to recognize different 
gesture shapes expressing specific emotions [10] . Their data set included 240 ges- 
tures which were collected when they asked ten participants (six male and four 
female) to project eight emotional states ('anger', 'despair', 'interest', 'pleasure', 
'sadness', 'irritation', 'joy' and 'pride') equally distributed in the valence arousal 
space. To extract the silhouette and the hands of the subjects, they used the 



298 I.-O. Stathopoulou and G.A. Tsihrintzis 

Eyes Web platform [11 . They computed five different expressive motion cues: 
quantity of motion and contraction index of the body, velocity, acceleration and 
fluidity of the hands barycentre, using the EyesWeb Expressive Gesture Pro- 
cessing Library. They analyzed the emotional behaviour based on both direct 
classification of time series and a model that provides indicators describing the 
dynamics of expressive motion cues. For the first task, they built a nearest neigh- 
bour based on DTW distance (1NN-DTW) classifier. They evaluated their sys- 
tem over two perspectives: (1) train and evaluation of performance using only the 
personal set of gestures (i.e. training one classifier per subject), and (2) train and 
evaluation of performance using the universal set (i.e. an inter-subject enabled 
classifier using the universal set of gestures) . Both classifiers were evaluated in 
the classification task of four (namely, 'anger', 'joy', 'pleasure' and 'sadness') 
and all the eight emotional states. Their system was not able to discriminate 
successfully between the eight emotions, but achieved an accuracy of 61% for 
the four emotions. 

Burgoon et al. [7] considered contextual cues, as well as analyzing cues from 
multiple body regions to lay the foundation for automatic identification of emo- 
tion from video. Their approach did not aim at classifying the body move- 
ments in discrete emotion classes, rather than identifying the person's emotional 
state in terms of positive/negative valence (pleasant/unpleasant) and high/low 
arousal/intensity. They first tracked the head and hands once an individual had 
been identified. In order to achieve this, they used a blob analysis developed 
by the Computational Bio-medicine Imaging and Modeling Center at Rutgers 
University [12], which is based on color analysis, eigenspace-based shape segmen- 
tation and Kalman filters to track head and hand positions throughout the video 
segment. General metrics, such as position, size, and angles were computed for 
each blob and utilized when generating meaningful features. For blob analysis, 
Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) 
were tested in the task of classifying individual gestures and RNN were found 
more adequate. 

Kapur et al. [5] classified full-body skeletal movements data obtained with 
a technology based on the VICON motion capturing system to classify four 
emotional states, namely: 'sadness', 'joy', 'anger' and 'fear'. VICON uses a series 
of 6 cameras to capture lightweight markers placed on various points of the body 
in 3-D space and digitizes movement into x, y, and z displacement data. They 
videotaped the movements of five subjects depicting the four emotions that they 
were asked to portray. They developed and tested five different classifiers: (1) a 
logistic regression, (2) a Naive-Bayes with a single multidimensional Gaussian 
distribution modeling each class, (3) a Decision Tree classifier based on the 
C4.5 algorithm, (4) a multi-layer perceptron back-propagation artificial neural 
network, and (5) a support vector machine trained using Sequential Minimal 
Optimization (SMO). Experimental results with different classifiers showed that 
automatic classification of this data ranged from 84% to 92% depending on 
how it was calculated. They also compared the system performance towards

the classification accuracy of human spectators, who managed to classify the 
emotion with 93% accuracy. 

All these approaches are summarized in Table [3j based on the requirement

3 Multimodal Emotion Recognition Systems 



These systems incorporate two or more input data in order to recognize the 
emotional state. The modalities usually include body movements and/or hand 
gestures with facial expressions |13ll4j . 

Balomenos et al. [13] developed an intelligent rule-based system for emotion 
classification into the six basic emotions, by using facial and hand movement 
information. Facial analysis included a number of processing steps which at- 
tempted to detect or track the face, to locate characteristic facial regions such 



300 I.-O. Stathopoulou and G.A. Tsihrintzis 

as eyes, mouth and nose on it, to extract and follow the movement of facial fea- 
tures, such as characteristic points in these regions, or model facial gestures using 
anatomic information about the faces. Hand gesture analysis included tracking 
the person's hands by creating moving skin color areas which were tracked be- 
tween subsequent frames. They tracked the centroid of those skin masks in order 
to estimate the user's movements. To facilitate the tracking process, they used 
a-priori knowledge related to the expected characteristics of the input image: 
the head is in the middle area of upper half of the frame and the hand segments 
near the respective lower corners. They trained a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) 
Classifier to classify among the following gesture classes: hand clapping - high 
frequency, hand clapping - low frequency, lift of the hand - low speed, lift of 
the hand - high speed, hands over the head - gesture, hands over the head - 
posture and italianate gestures. For the multimodal emotion classification task, 
the correlated these classes to the six emotional states. Specifically: 

â 'Joy': hand clapping - high frequency 

â 'Sadness': hands over the head - posture 

â 'Anger': lift of the hand - high speed, italianate gestures 

â 'Fear': hands over the head - gesture, italianate gestures 

â 'Disgust ': lift of the hand - low speed, hand clapping- low frequency 

â 'Surprise ': hands over the head - gesture 

The two subsystems were combined as a weighted sum, where the weights were 
0.75 and 0.25 for the facial expression recognition modality and the affective 
gesture recognition modality, respectively. 

Gunes et al. |14j also fused facial expression and body gesture information for 
bimodal emotion recognition. Their system was tested for the six following emo- 
tional classes: 'anxiety', 'anger', 'disgust', 'fear', 'happiness' and 'uncertainty'. 
They also built their own bimodal database (FABO) that consisted of recordings 
of facial expressions alone and combined face and body expressions ,15]. To form 
the training and testing set, they processed 54 sequences of frames in total, 27 for 
face and 27 for body from four subjects and selected the more expressive. Half 
of the frame were used for training and the other half for testing purposes. Their 
facial analysis subsystem was based on the FACS coding system, specifically, 
they identified the following for each emotion class: 

â 'Anxiety': Lip bite; stretching of the mouth; eyes turn up/down/lcft/right; 
lip wipe 

â 'Happiness': Corners of lips are drawn back and up; mouth may or may not 
be parted with teeth exposed or not; cheeks are raised; lower eyelid shows 
wrinkles below it, and may be raised but not tense; wrinkles around the 
outer corners of the eyes 

â 'Anger': Brows lowered and drawn together; lines appear between brows; 
lower lid is tensed and may or may not be raised; upper lid is tense and may 
or may not be lowered due to brows action; lips are either pressed firmly 
together with corners straight or down or open 



Emotion Recognition from Body Movements and Gestures 301 

â 'Fear': Brows raised and drawn together; forehead wrinkles drawn to the 
center; upper eyelid is raised and lower eyelid is drawn up; mouth is open; 
lips are slightly tense or stretched and drawn back 

â 'Disgust': Upper lip is raised; lower lip is raised and pushed up to upper 
lip or it is lowered; nose is wrinkled; cheeks are raised; brows are lowered; 
tongue out 

â 'Uncertainty': Lid drop; inner brow raised; outer brow raised; chin raised; 
jaw sideways; corners of the lips are drawn downwards 

They trained a BayesNet classifier which achieved an average performance of 
76.40%. 

For their body analysis subsystem, they identified the following for each emo- 
tion class: 

â 'Anxiety': Hands close to the table surface; fingers moving; fingers tapping 
on the table 

â 'Happiness': Body extended; hands kept high; hands made into fists and 
kept high 

â 'Anger': Body extended; hands on the waist; hands made into fists and kept 
low, close to the table surface 

â 'Fear': Body contracted; body backing; hands high up, trying to cover bodily 
parts 

â 'Disgust': Body backing; left/right hand touching the neck or face 

â 'Uncertainty': Shoulder shrug; palms up 

They also used a BayesNet classifier which achieved an average performance of 
89.90%. For the fusion of the two modalities, the applied two different methods: 

â Feature-level fusion: They fused all the features from the two modalities into 
a bigger vector matrix. Best-first search method was used with ten-fold cross 
validation to obtain a decisive reduction in the features' number and fed to 
a BayesNet classifier. The average classification rate was 94.03% for subjects 
already in the database. 

â Decision-level fusion: In this case, the final classification was based on the fu- 
sion of the outputs the different modalities. They tested various approaches, 
including the sum rule, product rule and the use of using weights. Sum rule 
provided the best fusion result with average recognition accuracy of 91.1%. 

Finally, el Kaliouby and Robinson [16] proposed a vision-based computational 
model to infer acted mental states from head movements and facial expressions. 
Their system was evaluated on videos that were posed by lay people in a rela- 
tively uncontrolled recording environment for six mental statesagreeing, concen- 
trating, disagreeing, interested, thinking and unsure. They used a use Dynamic 
Bayesian Networks (DBNs) to model the unfolding of mental states over time and 
each display was represented as a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) of a sequence of 
head/facial actions, recognized non-intrusively, in real time. Head actions were 
described by the magnitude and direction of 3 Euler angles, while facial actions 



302 I.-O. Stathopoulou and G.A. Tsihrintzis 

were extracted using motion, shape and colour analysis of the lips, mouth and 
eyebrows. The writers had trained and tested their system on videos from the 
Mind-Reading DVD (MR) [17] , a guide to emotions developed for Autism Spec- 
trum Disorders and achieve an average accuracy of 77.4%. They further tested 
the generalization of their system by collecting videos at the IEEE International 
Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2004). The 
classification rate was highest for disagreeing (85.7%) and lowest for thinking 
(26.7%). 

4 Conclusions and Future Work 

Generally, in the area of affective computing, there is a lack of researches on 
emotion recognition from body movements and hand/arm gestures, compared 
to the number of researches on human motion analysis and/or hand gesture 
analysis. Although there has been some psychological studies regarding emotion 
and nonverbal communication in expressive movements [18 19 20 , these studies 
were based on acted, stylized basic emotions. But, in affective computing the 
spontaneity of the emotions is very important and must be taken into account. 
Moreover, there is a lack of a widely accepted model which can represent human 
movements with regards to the experienced emotion, for example, like Facial 
Action Coding System (FACS) :21j which is considered the basis in the develop- 
ment of facial expression analysis systems. Maybe this is why that the majority 
of the approaches in emotion recognition from body movements and hand/arm 
gestures try to develop their own model by observing the persons' movements 
when they experiencing an emotion. Despite all the difficulties, the results are 
very promising, especially for the development of multimodal affective systems, 
and further research is necessary.

Abstract. An automated wood recognition system is designed based on five stages: 
data acquisition, pre-processing images, feature extraction, pre classification and 
classification. The proposed system is able to identify 52 types of wood species 
based on wood features extracted using Basic Grey Level Aura Matrix (BGLAM) 
technique and statistical properties of pores distribution (SPPD) technique. The 
features obtained from both feature extractors are fused together and will determine 
the classification between the various wood species. In order to enhance the class 
separability, a pre-classification stage is developed which includes clustering and 
dimension reduction. K-means clustering is introduced to cluster the 52 wood 
species. As for dimension reduction, we proposed linear discriminant analysis 
(LDA) to solve linear data and kernel discriminant analysis/ generalized singular 
value decomposition (KDA/GSVD) to solve nonlinearly structured data. For final 
classification, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifier is implemented to classify the 
wood species. 

Keywords: wood recognition, LDA, KDA/GSVD, K-means cluster, kNN 

classifier. 



1 Introduction 

Currently, very few certified officers are involved in the traditional wood 
identification process. The process of training up experienced officers in performing 
the job is difficult since there are approximately more than 1000 wood species in 
Malaysia. Moreover, the possibility of biasness in human recognition system has to be 
considered. Besides that, it is impractical and cost effective for a human to analyze 
and identify large amount of timber species. Hence automatic wood species 
recognition system is needed to overcome the errors caused by traditional wood 
identification system which based solely on human expertise. 

Khalid et. al [11] has developed an automatic Tropical Wood Species Recognition 
System using macroscopic features of timber based on image processing. In the work, 
the surface texture of timber is captured, and the features are extracted from the images

using Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and back propagation Neural 
Network (BPNN) is used to train and classify the timber species. Yusof et. al [12] 
adopted fusion of two feature sets using multi feature extractor technique. Two feature 
extraction methods were used in this system: co-occurrence matrix approach (GLCM) 
and Gabor filters. These two extraction methods produced more variation of features 
and also improved the accuracy rate of the system. Gabor filters are used in the pre- 
processing stage of the wood texture image to multiply the number of features for a 
single image, thus providing more information for feature extractor to capture. K. Wang 
et.al [13] proposed a wood surface texture recognition method based on feature level 
data fusion which uses three types of texture analysis methods. The three texture 
analysis methods used are gray co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), Gauss-Markov random 
field (GMRF) and wavelet multi-resolution fractal dimension. The fusion method is 
based on Simulated Annealing Algorithm with memory and the recognition rate of 
nearest neighbor classifier, fuses the extracted parameters in the feature level. In a later 
development, Khairuddin et.al [14] used feature selection based on genetic algorithm to 
improve the accuracy of wood species recognition, in particular to reduce the redundant 
features which are not considered as discriminatory enough for accurate classification. 

Due to the large variations of features within inter and intra among the species of 
the tropical wood, and the problems relating to variations in the wood samples, there 
is a pressing need to improve the methodology of the wood recognition system. The 
conventional method of using the feature extraction followed by classification in the 
recognition of wood species is no longer adequate for a larger sample of wood 
species. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a two step classifications for the wood 
recognition system. The first step is called the pre classification stage utilizes the 
clustering and dimension reduction techniques. K-means clustering is introduced to 
cluster kernel in order to enhance the class-discriminatory information in the lower- 
dimensional space. LDA is applied to reduce dimension of linear data while 
KDA/GSVD is used to reduce dimension of nonlinear data. Finally, at the second 
classification stage, we used k-NN (K nearest neighbour) classifier to classify the 
wood species. The experimental results presented in section 3 shows that the 
implementation of clustering and dimension reduction improves the classification 
accuracy of the system. 

This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we presented the methodology of 
the proposed system. In section 3, experimental results are discussed followed by 
brief conclusion in section 4. 



2 Proposed Methodologies 

The methodology of the proposed system consists of image acquisition, image pre- 
processing, feature extraction, clustering in the pre classification stage and 
classification. Figure 1 shows the overview of the proposed system. 

2.1 Image Acquisition 

The wood samples for this research are obtained from the Forest Research Institute of 
Malaysia (FRIM). There are 52 wood species in cubic form (approximately 1 inch by 



Using Two Stage Classification for Improved Tropical Wood Species 307 

1 inch in size) where 5 cubes are provided for each species. The images of the wood 
surface are captured by using a specially designed portable camera with 10 times 
magnification. The size of the each image is 768x576 pixels. In total, there are 100 
images taken from each wood species where 90 images are for training and the other 
10 images are for testing.

2.2 Image Pre-processing 

The wood images are pre-processed using homomorphic filters in order to enhance 
the image presentation. Homomorphic filtering sharpens features and flattens lighting 
variations in an image. Hence, illumination and reflectance on the image can be 
removed. Figure 2 below shows the pre-processed images of wood species:

2.3 Feature Extraction 



In this paper, we use the same features that have been used by Khairuddin et.al [14]. 
In their work, the wood features were extracted based on the fusion of Basic Grey 
Level Aura Matrix (BGLAM) & Statistical Properties of Pores Distribution (SPPD). 
The total number of features extracted from each wood sample is 157 features (136 
features from BGLAM and 21 features from SPPD). 

An image can be uniquely represented by its BGLAMs. In essence, the BGLAMs 
of an image characterize the co-occurrence probability distributions of gray levels at 
all possible displacements configurations. It is proven that BGLAMs can give the 
necessary and sufficient information to differentiate between images. In addition, 
BGLAM features are directly calculated from the images thus providing a more 
accurate representation of an image. The framework of BGLAM feature extractor is 
explained in detail in [10]. 

SPPD extracts statistical properties of pores distribution on the image sample. 
These features will allow only distinct pores to be acknowledged as characteristics of 
a species. From the images shown in figure 2, these features are extracted from each 
wood sample: 

1 . Mean size of the pores and the corresponding standard deviation (2 features) 

2. Mean distance between pores and the corresponding standard deviation (2 
features) 

3. Number of small, medium and large pores (3 features) 

4. Number of pairs and solitary pores (2 features) 

5. Number of pores per square millimeters (1 feature) 

By using SPPD feature extrtactor, 10 features are obtained from black pores image 
and 10 features are obtained from white pores image. Another 1 feature is the mean 
grey level feature which is obtained from the original image. Hence, total features 
extracted from each image by using SPPD technique is 21 features. 

2.4 Pre Classification stage 

Pre-classification stage includes clustering using k-means clustering technique and 
dimension reduction using LDA and KDA/GSVD techniques. The goal of pre- 
classification stage is to enhance the class-discriminatory information in a lower- 
dimensional space. 

2.4.1 Clustering 

Based on the features extracted from each wood sample, the wood database is 
clustered into 18 clusters using k-means clustering. The number of cluster is chosen 
based on results presented in Table 1 in section 3. Each cluster will have its own 
wood database and classification stage. 

Given a set of training wood samples n (xj, X2, â â â , x n ), where n represents the 
number of training wood samples in the database. Each wood sample, jc is a real 
vector of wood features where jc = (x;,...,x i57 ) since there are 157 features extracted 



Using Two Stage Classification for Improved Tropical Wood Species 309 

from each wood sample. K-means clustering aims to partition n wood samples into k 
clusters (k<n) 

S = {S,,S 2 ,...,S k } (1) 

so as to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares as in equation 1 : 

argmm ^^ ^ neS .||a: n - fa || 2 , fa is the mean of points in S t . (2) 

The algorithm of the k-means clustering is shown below: 

1) Determine number of cluster, k. 

2) Determine initial set of k means fi lt ..., ft k as cluster centers using random 
permutation. 

3) Assign each wood sample to the nearest cluster center based on minimum- 
distance classifier. That is, we can say thatxâ is in cluster k if II x n - fa II is the 
minimum of all the i distances based on equation 2. 

Si = {x n :\\x n -iii\\< \\x n -Hi*\\ , for all/* = l,...,k] (3) 

4) Based on the clustering results from step 3, we will update the cluster centers, fa 
by calculating new means to be the centroid of the wood samples in the cluster i. 
Where x t represents the wood samples belong to cluster i. The centroid is 
updated based on equation 4. 



" i= ^I> 



(4) 



5) Repeat step 3 and 4 until the centroid for every clusters no longer move which 
means convergence has been reached. 

6) Then, variance can be used to measure how far a set of wood samples are spread 
out from each other within the same cluster. Variance of each cluster, v, is 
calculated based on equation 5. 

* = ^f ^ 

7) Average variance, v avg is calculated in order to determine the right number of 
cluster to be used in the pre-classification stage. Smaller value of v avg will 
optimize the clustering. 

Vavg = ~ (6)

2.4.2 Dimension Reduction Using LDA and KDA/GSVD 

The objective of LDA is to perform dimensionality reduction while preserving as 
much of the class discriminatory information as possible. But this method fails for a 
nonlinear problem. In order to make LDA applicable to nonlinearly structured data, 
kernel-based method has been applied which is known as kernel discriminant analysis 
(KDA). In KDA, Radial basis function (RBF) kernel function was employed into 
LDA to handle nonlinearity in a computationally attractive manner. However, due to 
the nonlinear map by the kernel function, the dimension of the feature space often 
becomes much larger than that of the original data space, and as a result, the scatter 
matrices become singular, which is referred to as "small sample size" (SSS) problem. 
Hence, KDA/GSVD has been proposed, which is a generalization of LDA based on 
the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD). It overcomes the SSS 
problem. 

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) 

The concept of LDA is to find vectors in the underlying space which best discriminate 
among classes. This idea is achieved by maximizing the within class variance. In the 
proposed system, there are c = 52 distinct classes in all the training samples, M, is the 
number of training samples in class i, thus, the between-class scatter matrix Sb and 
the within-class scatter matrix S w can be defined by: 

S^ZUMiiXi-fiKXi-liy (7) 

S w = Li=iLx kÂ£ Xi( x k ~~ Mi)(*fc â Mi) c (8) 

Here, jc, represents the set of wood images belonging to class i, ^ is the mean of 
samples in class i, [i is the mean of all samples and x k is the Ath image of that class. 
LDA computes a transformation that maximizes the between-class scatter while 
minimizing the within-class scatter: 

Maximize ^^- (9) 

det(S w ) 

Nonlinear Discriminant Analysis Based on Kernel Functions KDA and GSVD 

In this section, we present a nonlinear extension of LDA based on kernel functions 
and the GSVD. The main idea of the kernel method is that without knowing the 
nonlinear feature mapping or the mapped feature space explicitly, we can work on the 
feature space through kernel functions, as long as the problem formulation depends 
only on the inner products between data points. This is based on the fact that for any 
kernel function k satisfying Mercer's condition, there exists a mapping (p such that, 

<(p{d),(p{b)>=k{a,b) (10) 

Where <,> is an inner product in the feature space transformed by (p. 



Using Two Stage Classification for Improved Tropical Wood Species 311 

We apply the kernel method to perform LDA in the feature space instead of the 
original input space. Given a kernel function A:, let <p be a mapping satisfying equation 
10 and define F c R N to be the feature space from the mapping q>. A Gaussian is 
used as the RBF kernel based on equation 1 1 . 



k(A,B) = K rbw (A,B) = exp( 



d 2 (A,B) 



) , where o Â£ R 



(11) 



The RBF kernel returns an RBF kernel matrix from the input coordinates. The 
inputs of the RBF kernel are a matrix containing all wood features and the kernel 
width. The output of the kernel is dependent on the Euclidean distance of B from A 
(one of these will be the support vector and the other will be the testing data point. 
The support vector will be the center of the RBF and a will determine the area of 
influence this support vector has over the data space. 

The algorithm of KDA/GSVD is shown below [5]: 

Given a data matrix A = [ a h ..., aâ] Â£ R"â¢" with r classes and a kernel function K, it 
computes the r-1 dimensional representation of any input vector z Â£ R m by applying 
GSVD in the feature space defined by the feature mapping tp such that K(a u aj) = 
<(p(cij) : q> (cij)> 

1) Compute between-class scatter matrix,^, and within-class scatter matrix, K w . 

2) Apply GSVD to the pair K h and K w . And we have vector of singular matrix,

3 Final Classification 



KNN classifier is used to classify the wood species. The test data is classified by 
calculating the Euclidean distance, d(x,y) to the nearest training data as in equation 
16. Then, use simple majority of the category of nearest neighbours to determine the 
wood species of the test data. 



d(x,y) = ^ 7 1 (x i -y i y (16) 

Where x represents the training data and y represents the test data. 

The efficiency of the proposed system is calculated using equation 17.

4 Experimental Results 

We performed several experiments to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed 
method. For clustering method, it is important to select the correct number of clusters 
for good recognition rate. Based on results shown in Table 1, the classification 
accuracy increases from 87% to 96.15% as the number of cluster increases from k=6 
to Â£=18. The highest accuracy rate is achieved when k= 18. Hence, the right number 
of cluster that we chose to cluster the wood database is 18 clusters. 

Table 2 shows that the variance of each cluster varies for different number of k. 
The variance is computed in order to measure how far a set of wood samples are 
spread out from the cluster centroid within the same cluster. Average variance is 
calculated to compare the optimization of clustering for different number of clusters, 
k. The smallest average variance is achieved when k=18 with value v avg = 0.5049 
which results to highest classification accuracy shown in table 1. 

The implementation of pre classification stage in the proposed recognition system 
has improved the classification accuracy from 84% to 96.15%. Besides that, the 
introduction of clustering technique has also shown to improve the proposed system 
with increment of classification accuracy from 89.5% to 96.15%.

5 Conclusion 

This paper concludes that the implementation of k-means clustering and dimension 
reduction as the pre-classification stage has reduced the computing time and improved 
the performance of the wood recognition system. The k-means clustering enables the 
system to only compute the wood database in a respective cluster instead of 
computing the entire database to classify a wood species while dimension reduction 
enables the wood samples to be represented accurately in a lower-dimensional space.

Abstract. In this paper we propose a summarization method for scien- 
tific articles from the viewpoint of the syntactic sequences. The objective 
is to generate an extractive summary by ranking sentences according to 
their informative content, on the basis of the idea that the writing styles 
of authors create syntactic patterns which may contain important in- 
formation about topics explained in a research paper. We use two main 
document features in our summarizing algorithm: syntactic sequences 
and frequent terms per section. We present an evaluation of our pro- 
posed algorithm by comparing it with existing summarization methods. 

Keywords: text summarization, text analysis, parts of speech. 



1 Introduction 

In the scientific area an important task is to search and select information from 
research papers. This task is usually time-consuming and difficult, since infor- 
mation is created daily. Automatic summarization tools assist this task and 
provide brief overviews of documents. Although different methods have been 
used in summarization, it is still difficult to obtain good results. One of the core 
steps in automatic document summarization is the selection of sentences which 
contain representative contents. Contents inside a scientific article are expressed 
by means of terms and syntactic structure. The terms are usually related to a 
certain thematic domain, and the syntactic structure is shown by the writer's 
knowledge and writing skills. Patterns in the syntactic structure may represent 
the authors' intentions to express important information. These patterns are 
assumed to be represented as frequent syntactic structures in a document and 
may include informative content. The utilization of these structure patterns in 
combination with other summarization techniques may provide better sentence 
selection. 

Text in general is composed by the lexical part, referring to the meaning of 
the words, and by the syntactical part, corresponding to the arrangement of 
those words. For the extraction of information from texts, words are commonly 
used because they explicitly carry meaning, but the arrangement of words in 
sentences also represents meaning 0]. Scientific articles have particular use of

certain syntactical sequences due to their formal style, and these are in the form 
of phrases, collocations and expressions used by writers [S]- 

In this research we mainly focus on the document features of the scientific 
articles from the viewpoint of the text writing way, such as the uses of syntactic 
structures and document sections for the explanation of key topics in addition 
to looking upon words as content source. Our objective is to generate document 
summaries using these features. This paper is organized as follows. The next 
section describes some related works with respect to the use of the syntactic fea- 
tures of documents for summarization. Section 3 introduces our idea behind the 
selection of document features. Section 4 presents the summarization algorithm 
and Section 5 describes the experiment in comparison with other summarization 
methods. Finally, Section 6 concludes this paper. 

2 Related Works 

The arrangement of terms has been considered in summarization methods for 
example to locate collocations, such as lexical chains, although the concept of 
lexical chains differs from syntactic sequences in which the lexical chains are 
sequences of word meanings rather than the syntactic classification of those 
words [1114] . Barzilay et al. use lexical chains for the sentence selection, frequent 
terms occurring in the lexical chains and sentence location in the text. 

Most of the existing summarization methods, which use the syntactic clas- 
sification of terms, employ them for expansion of term meanings, and this ap- 
proach is usually combined with other features such as sentence position, term 
frequency, etc. Examples of these methods are typically proposed in the works 
|2I7| . Bawakid et al. use sentence selection based on the semantic similarity of 
sentences and also use parts of speech to find linguistic qualifiers which may 
indicate the importance of terms, as well as to expand term meanings with syn- 
onyms. No other syntactic information is used in their method. Liu et al. use the 
positions of words in the sentence along with parts of speech tagging to deter- 
mine the most significant words in the text. The tagged terms are used to extend 
their definitions by employing external sources such as ontologies, and after term 
frequencies are obtained. They do not consider the syntactical features for the 
sentence ranking, although parts of speech are used. 

More sophisticated uses of syntactic information are for rhetorical analysis 
of texts |12ll6j . Teufel et al. uses document features such as position, section 
structure, term frequency, verb syntax, etc. among others to rank sentences 
based on their rhetorical status and relevance. Although a rhetoric analysis of 
documents can lead to approximate the discourse structure of the document 
better than simple syntactic analysis, this method requires manually annotated 
resources which are not always available. 

3 Idea behind Selected Document Features 

For the summarization process we have considered two main features of scientific 
articles. The first is based on the informative content of syntactic sequences and 



Text Summarization of Single Documents Based on Syntactic Sequences 317 

the second is related to the document structure from a viewpoint which the 
distribution of key terms differ according to the document sections. We explain 
in more detail these features. 

The original idea in the use of syntactic sequences was introduced by 6 , which 
demonstrated that frequently occurring syntactic sequences contained within a 
corpus, captured the most informative content based on the least-effort con- 
suming principle. Lioma referred to these syntactic sequences as parts of speech 
blocks or POS blocks, and employed them as part of an indexing method for 
information retrieval. In our research we consider the extraction of syntactic 
sequences from scientific articles based on a similar principle. Our main reason 
is that authors usually have their own writing styles, formed of common struc- 
tures distributed throughout the text. These structures are used to convey or 
contextualize data which requires explanation, using understandable language. 

POS blocks are obtained by replacing words with their syntactic information 
or parts of speech classification, but by retaining their sequential order in the 
sentence. Sequences can have variable length and their tokens may overlap. The 
extraction process is similar to n-grams extraction method where n tokens are 
defined as a sequence, and in the next iteration the starting position for the 
next sequence advances one token. Figure [1] shows POS blocks from a sentence 
(highlighted in yellow) with a length of four:

preposition adjective

The syntactic sequences observed frequently in scientific articles contain terms 
corresponding to domain-specific concepts or main topics explained in the article. 
The terms which form part of the syntactic sequences determine the amount 
of informative content. Table Q] shows fragments of text corresponding to two 
syntactic sequences, the underlined terms are part of the article's main topic. 

The second feature of scientific articles is their use of sections to explain dif- 
ferent topics. Researches have demonstrated that in certain sections of an article 
there are words that appear more frequently in relation to other sections |13| .

This is consistent with the idea that research papers use particular sections to 
explain topics. If these topics are explained using the authors' writing styles, 
then words from those topics may form part of frequent syntactic sequences. 
Combining these two concepts we can assume that frequent overlapping words 
from a section with frequent syntactic sequences, represents important informa- 
tion about the article's content. Therefore these document features may be used 
as a criteria for sentence selection in automatic summarization. 



4 Summarization Algorithm 

For the application of the summarization algorithm, the text is initially pre- 
processed by separating the text into sentences and assigning shallow parts of 
speech tags. The summarization algorithm consists of three main steps: First, di- 
vide the document according to sections and remove non-contextual text such as 
the reference list, Acknowledgements, etc.; Second, apply a keyword extraction 
method optimized for use on a single document based on word co-occurrence 
|8ll5j ; and Third, select the sentences which contain the k most frequent syn- 
tactic sequences. Algorithms 1, 2 and 3 describe the summarization process. 

In the first step POS blocks with a specified length of n tagged terms are 
created. Each created sequence is stored if it has not already been stored before; 
otherwise a counter for that sequence is incremented. This process is repeated 
for all the terms in the text. Finally, the top k sequences with the highest counter 
value are selected. 

In the second step, high scores are assigned to terms which occur frequently 
in each section but are also mentioned in other sections; this method is based 
on a chi square scoring function. Finally, the top m terms are selected, where m 
must be specified. 

The last step is the combination of the previous two. From the selected 
sentences in step 1, sentences which contained the frequent terms per section

5 Evaluation 

In order to evaluate the syntactic sequence based summarization we initially pro- 
cessed a set of 20 scientific articles, removed the abstract and the bibliography, 
and then applied our summarizer to the documents. Our extractive summariza- 
tion method selected in average 20% of the sentences from the documents. We 
applied five other extractive summarizcrs to the same text based on three types 
of summarization methods: baseline, frequency-based and multiple feature. The 



320 



P. Villavicencio and T. Watanabe 



two baseline summarizers are Baseline-Lead, which sequentially selects the first 
20 % of sentences from the source text, and Baseline- Random, which randomly 
selects 20 % of the sentences in the source text. The frequency-based summarizer 
Open Text Summarizer (OTS) [llj uses frequently-used words to give a higher 
score to sentences. SweSum [3] and MEAD use multiple features to identify sen- 
tences [10] . SweSum is a summarizer for texts written in Swedish or English, 
and uses features such as sentence position and numerical data identification. 
MEAD is a single/multi-document summarizer which uses features such as posi- 
tion of sentence within the text, first sentence overlap, sentence length, and also 
a centroid method based on a cluster of related documents. The criteria for the 
selection of the summarizers was based on their availability. 

We compared the resulting summarizations with the original abstract of the 
paper. The comparison was done using content-based scoring methods to mea- 
sure lexical similarity. The six used methods were: Simple cosine, which calcu- 
lates the cosine similarity with a simple binary count if the word exists in the 
document; Cosine, which uses the inverse document frequency weights and in- 
cludes the actual count of words; B-Overlap and T-Overlap, which measure the 
bigram and trigram overlap respectively; Norm LCS, which measures the nor- 
malized longest common substring and finally Bleu, which uses closeness metrics 
based on n-grams. Bleu was originally developed to evaluate translated texts [5]. 
The similarity scores are shown in Table [21

For the first six summarizations shown in Table [2] the proposed algorithm was 
used. Our algorithm requires the parameter for the number of top k key words 
per section. In this experiment setup a value of 10 was used. Also values for the 
length of the POS blocks were specified from four to seven. Finally the number 
of top k frequent POS blocks was set to ten and twenty. From Tabled the first 
six rows correspond to different combinations of the POS block length values 
and the top k frequency values. In the case of the first row, the top ten frequent 
sequences of length four was used; from the second row, the top ten frequent 
sequences of length five, and so on. The row labeled TermPerSect corresponds 



Text Summarization of Single Documents Based on Syntactic Sequences 321 

to the summarization where only the term ranking score was used in order to 
compare the summarization based only on frequent terms per section without 
considering frequent POS blocks. For the different configurations of POS block 
lengths and top k selected sentence values, the scores are similar among the 
scoring methods with exception of the Cosine score where there is a variation. 
In all the other scores, the selection of top twenty frequent POS blocks of length 
six has a slight improvement over the other settings in our algorithm. Comparing 
our summarization method with the additional methods, our summarizer scored 
better than the OTS and Baseline Random, but had a low score with respect to 
Mead, SweSum and Baseline-Lead. 

6 Conclusion 

We have proposed a method of single document summarization applied to re- 
search papers considering mainly two document features: syntactic sequences 
and term frequency in document sections. One of the advantages of this method 
is that it does not require external sources. This method may also be applied for 
multi-language summarization. Although the scoring results of the experiment 
did not reveal much improvement over other existing methods, it can be further 
enhanced by using advance statistics in the ranking of syntactic sequences and 
in combination with other document features. It is also necessary to evaluate the 
summarization using other standardized summarization evaluation methods.

Abstract. This paper aims at developing an Automatic Music Genre 
Classification system and focuses on calculating algorithms that (ideally) can 
predict the music class in which a music file belongs. The proposed system is 
based on techniques from the fields of Signal Processing, Pattern Recognition, 
and Information Retrieval, as well as Heuristic Optimization Methods. One 
thousand music files are used for training and validating the classification 
system. These files are distributed equally in ten classes. From each file, eighty 
one (81) features are extracted and used to create 81 similarity matrices. These 
81 similarity matrices constitute the training instances. During the training 
phase, feature selection takes place via a modified hybrid Genetic Algorithm in 
order to improve the class discrimination clarity and reduce the calculating cost. 
In this algorithm, the crossover probability is replaced by a parent pair number 
that produces new solutions via a taboo list. Also, an adaptive mutation, an 
adaptive local exhaustive search and an adaptive replace strategy are used, 
depending on whether the system has reached a local extreme. Local exhaustive 
search takes place in the most optimal up to the current solution neighboring 
chromosomes. The Genetic Algorithm fitness function constitutes a weighted 
nearest neighbors classifier. Thus, the chromosome fitness is proportional to the 
classifier accuracy that the chromosome creates. During the classification 
phase, the features selected via the Genetic Algorithm create an adjusted nearest 
neighbor classifier that performs the classifications. From each new music file 
pending classification, selected features are extracted and then compared with 
the corresponding features of the database music files. The music file is 
assigned to the class indicated by the k nearest music files.

1 Introduction 

Automatic audio signal classification constitutes a research area that has received 
much attention over the last years. It is considered a keystone of Music Information

Retrieval [1,5,6,7,8]. The music can be classified into categories based on genre, 
performer, composer, culture that represents, emotion that causes to the user [2] and - 
generally speaking- based on any separation can be useful to humans. Musical genres 
are labels created and used by humans for categorizing and describing the vast 
universe of music [3], A content based classification, constitutes difficult problem for 
both computers and humans, since very rarely there is accuracy and clarity in musical 
qualities and features of each class [3], Even though boundaries of classes can be very 
fuzzy, it is clear that the members of a particular genre share certain characteristics. 
The applications of automatic music genre classification are many and are extended in 
both academic and commercial level [4,2]. The present paper deals with Automatic 
Music Genre Classification and focuses on computational algorithms that can 
(ideally) predict in which class, a music track belongs. 

Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning techniques help in dealing music genre 
classification problems [9]. A typical Pattern Recognition System usually consists of three 
steps and in fact it is a system of supervised machine learning. The three steps of Pattern 
Recognition system is data acquisition, feature extraction and classification. In training 
mode two more steps are added, the feature selection and system evaluation. In a wider 
sense data acquisition and feature extraction constitute the process of recognition. 
Classification refers to a conversion between features (F) and classes (C) [10]. Therefore 
pattern recognition can be described as a conversion from the area of measurement (M) in 
the feature area (F) and finally in the Decision area (D) : M â > F â > D . In the present 
work the conversion between features and classes is done by an adjusted k-NN 
classifier [11]. 

In most real problems, features can be noisy and many of them not relative to the 
particular objective function that is sought to approach. In addition it is very likely 
features to indicate overlapping classes. In order to simulate such systems, a feature 
selection takes place with probabilistic approach. The problem of feature selection 
can be considered as an optimization problem. 

Genetic Algorithms (GA) constitute a group of probabilistic (stochastic) search and 
optimization techniques proposed (initially) by J. Holland at the University of 
Michigan in 1975 [8,13,10]. Gas follows two basic rules, the passage of information 
from one generation to the next (inheritance) and survival of the fittest. The GA is a 
seeking process of the optimal solution, through a set of solutions that are candidates 
for a problem. The set of all possible solutions called population. The candidate 
solutions which can be selected to solve a problem called chromosomes. Each 
chromosome consists of a construction set elements called genes. Each "parent" 
generation is evaluated through an evaluation function that yields a "grade". The next 
generation is created so as to get a higher grade, i.e. to represent a better solution [15]. 
In the following lines a modified hybrid GA is analyzed. 

2 Musical Surface Features - Feature Extraction 

Each natural entity allocates a set of features. Each feature constitutes an entity's 
compact representation. Thus the environment, based on this set of features, can 
describe, recognize or even compare the entity. Such a set of features allocate also 
acoustic signals. In the substance, acoustic signal feature can be any mathematical 



Automatic Music Genre Classification Using Hybrid Genetic Algorithms 325 

model which represents the acoustic signal. A set of 8 1 features are presented to the 
algorithm, so the algorithm can choose those features who contributes more in the 
classes' segregation. 

Three types of features are used: one value feature, one dimension (vector) feature 
and two dimension (matrix) feature. The distance between two features is measured 
with the City block metric. 

The following features are calculated for each "analysis" window [16] of 20msec 
with 10msec window step (220 samples with 110 samples overlap at 11025 sampling 
rate). The frequency domain features calculation is based on the Short Time Fourier 
Transform (STFT) that can be efficiently calculated using the Fast Fourier Transform 
(FFT) algorithm [16]. 

These features are: Short-time Energy (Time domain feature), Zero Crossing Rate 
(Noise in signal)(Time domain feature), Spectral Centroid (Spectral 
Brightness)(Frequency domain feature), Spectral Rolloff (Spectral Shape) (Frequency 
domain feature), Spectral Flux (Spectral Change)(Frequency domain feature), 
Spectral Entropy (Frequency domain feature). 

Six statistical moments [17] (Median value, standard derivation divided by mean 
value, mean value, standard derivation, max value divided by median value, max 
value) of these features are calculated over a "texture" window [16] of 1 second 
consisting of 100 "analysis" windows. Thus, thirty six features are created where each 
of these consists of a thirty elements vector. Two acoustic signals can belong in the 
same class, but this does not mean necessarily that there is simultaneous presence of 
similar events, among them. For this reason, it is also extracted the mean value of 
these vectors, generating thirty six features of one value, giving weight to the quantity 
of different events rather than the time instance they were took place. 

RMS energy feature (signal Loudness [18]) is also extracted from the signal. The 
Energy RMS is calculated for each "analysis" window of 50msec with 25msec 
window step. The mean value of these analysis windows constitutes the -one value- 
Energy RMS feature. In addition, the mean value of energy RMS analysis windows 
that their values is lower than the energy RMS value of the corresponding texture 
window, constitutes the -one value- Low energy feature. 

The following three features focus on aspects related to timbre and periodicities in 
the signal. They are matrix features and they are based on a sone / bark scale (a 
perceptual scale which groups frequencies to critical bands according to perceptive 
pitch regions) representation of the audio signal. Spectrum Histograms [19] are a 
simple approach to summarize the spectral shape. The SHs describe a piece by 
counting how many times each loudness level was exceeded in each frequency band. 
SHs feature calculated for each "analysis" window of 20msec, with 10msec window 
step, for 25 loudness levels histogram analysis and for 20 critical frequency bands. 
Periodicity Histograms were originally presented in the context of beat tracking [20]. 
The idea is to describe periodically reoccurring beats. PHs feature calculated for each 
"analysis" window of 46,4msec, with 23,2msec window step, for 60 modified 
frequencies and for 20 critical frequency bands. Fluctuation Patterns are an alternative 
approach to describe periodicities. The main difference between FPs [21] and PHs is 
that the FPs includes information on the energy distribution in the frequency spectrum 
which the PHs discards. They are calculated in the same manner as the PHs. 



326 G.V. Karkavitsas and G.A. Tsihrintzis 

Statistical Spectrum Descriptors [22] are derived from a psycho-acoustically 
transformed Bark-scale spectrogram and comprise several statistical moments, which 
are intended to describe fluctuations on a number of critical frequency bands. The 
spectrogram is computed using the short time Fast Fourier Transform (STFT) 
(window size 23msec and 50 % overlap). The Bark scale (24 critical bands [23]) is 
applied to the spectrogram and The Bark scale spectrogram is then transformed into 
the decibel scale. Subsequently, the values are transformed into Sone values, in order 
to approximate the loudness sensation of the human auditory system. From this 
representation of a segment's spectrogram the following statistical moments are 
computed in order to describe fluctuations within the critical bands: mean, median, 
variance, skew-ness, kurtosis, min- and max-value are computed for each critical 
band, forming the SSD feature vector of 168 elements. Also another version of SSD 
feature is used. This -one value- feature for an audio file is calculated as the median 
of the SSD feature. 

The last two features are based on chromagram. A non-overlapping analysis 
window of 100msec is used, and the mean over a texture window of 1 second is 
calculated. These calculations creates a 12 rows (notes) and 30 columns (seconds) 
matrix. The first -matrix- feature is constituted by the sorting version of this matrix, 
giving weight in the frequency of each event. The second -vector- feature is 
constituted by the mean of 30 seconds for each note. 

3 Feature Selection 

3.1 Feature Weighting 

Assigning variable weights to the feature instances before applying the kNN 
classifier, distorts the space and modifying the importance of each feature to reflect its 
relevance for classification. In this way, similarity with respect to important feature 
becomes more critical than similarity with respect to irrelevant features. Therefore 

one weight value corresponds to each feature F = {wj â  Ji,w 2 â¢ J2,--,w n â¢ J n ) , This 
method is called feature weighting [24]. Thus, it can be said that the system is looking 
for the most robust feature analogy which makes more clear the class discrimination 
clarity. In 1991, James Kelly and Lawrence Davis [24] developed a hybrid Genetic 
Algorithms weighted k-nearest neighbors for analogy selection of features with very 
good results. In feature selection method every time a similarity matrix weighted by 
different features each time should be calculated and graded based on classification 
accuracy. In terms of time, it might be better to have similarity matrices for each 
feature separately instead of the initial features expression. Then, adding individual 
features similarity matrices with combination that indicated by the each chromosome, 
the classifier similarity matrix is resulted. In the present paper the City Block metric is 
used. Of course, other metrics suggest different ways of combining and calculating 
the classifier similarity matrix. 

3.2 The Proposed Genetic Algorithm Approach 

The flow chart of the proposed Genetic Algorithm approach is given in Figure 1 .

Fig. 1. Flowchart of the proposed Genetic Algorithm 

3.2.1 Chromosomes 

In the feature selection problem, there is a pool of features L where some of them 
should be selected, while others should be dismissed. Therefore a binary vector with 
length equal to the number of features can be used as a candidate solution's 
representation 



Chromosome=[g l ,g 2 ,..,g L ] 



(1) 



where 8 G l",lj and L the number of features. Given the binary encoding there are 



2 different candidate solutions. 



3.2.2 Fitness Function 

Critical for the success of the genetic algorithm is the choice of the evaluation 
(fitness) function [15]. Indeed this is the only means of communication between the 
genetic evolutionary process and its environment (i.e., the problem it seeks to solve). 
When chromosomes of the current generation are graded by the fitness function, the 
genetic algorithm gains feedback from the environment so as to adjust its evolution 
towards an improved next generation. For the problem at hand, the chromosomes 
fitness evaluation is done by using an adjusted k-NN nearest neighbor classifier. 



328 G.V. Karkavitsas and G.A. Tsihrintzis 

In the feature selection phase, every feature is replaced by a coresponding 
similarity matrix of the input entities who calculated based on this particular feature. 

So if initially there were L features F = \Ji s , i = 1..X for the selection phase, now 

there are L similarity matrices ^>M = i 5m ; / , i = 1..X created by these features. A 
weight via the L gene of chromosome is applied in each one of the L similarity 
matricies (the value of each gene corresponds to a specific similarity matrix and hence 
to a specific feature). Then, all similarity matrices are added (depending on the metric 
that is used) generating the classifier's similarity matrix (Eq. 2), who is normalized by 
his maximum value.

(=1 

Since it has been produced a matrix showing the correlations between all entities of 
the database, can be calculated easily and quickly in which class belongs each entity 
using the method leave one out cross validation and even for different number of 
nearest neighbors. For different values of k nearest neighbors, the classifier's 
accuracy is calculated and the k that gives the best accuracy is held. Since this work is 
an academic reference we choose not to integrated number k nearest neighbors as a 
gene on the chromosome (i.e automatic selection), but (due to its small size) to 
investigate it exhaustively. Thus can be said that the best chromosome is considered 
the chromosome that indicates such a feature selection, based in which the classifier 
achieves maximum accuracy. Lower fitness is better fitness (Eq. 3). 

fitness = 1 - accuracy (3) 



3.2.3 Parent Selection 

In each generation, P p parent pairs are selected for the offspring production via the 
roulette-wheel selection rule [12]. Each parent "a" can be selected again (in the same 
generation) to produce descendants but not with the same parent "b". This achieved via a 
Tabu list which is writing all the parent pairs that are selected in one generation. Thus, up 
to P p = N â  (N â 1) parent pairs can be selected in each generation, where N is the 

chromosomes number in the population. In such a case, more suitable chromosomes 
are free to crossover their genetic material with more than one other chromosomes. 
Also, it is possible to be selected such a P p , so that the offspring to the next generation 
is far more than the fixed population (Overpopulation). 

3.2.4 Genetic Operations 

The crossover probability is repealed, as the crossover rate is determined by the 
number P p of breeding parent pairs mentioned in the above section. In this work two 
types of crossover were used, multi -point crossover and uniform crossover [25]. With 
these two aspects of crossover used, the system ensures that produced offspring in the 
case of multi-point crossover, containing large contiguous segments from each parent, 
while in the case of a uniform crossover, the produced offspring containing smaller 
and more alternating segments of each parent. Each crossover operation produces up 
to four descendants. 



Automatic Music Genre Classification Using Hybrid Genetic Algorithms 329 

Mutation is a genetic operation that introduces the concept of variable in the 
chromosome. This variable can be global or local, and intended to prevent the entire 
set of solutions in the population reach a local extreme. So, this genetic operation is 
enabled only in the case which system reaches a local extreme before the termination 
condition fulfilled. The criterion to decide that the solutions of the population are very 
similar to each other, so it is difficult for the current generation to provide better 
solutions to future generations, is the mean fitness of the entire population. When 
mean fitness of the population remains constant (or less than a threshold value) 
between two consecutive generations, mutant function is activated. In essence it is 
adaptive mutation (Whitley and Starkweather) [26], where instead of a constant 
mutation rate, it varies depending the genetic homogeneity of the population. 
Provided that mutation activation is so rare, it is advisable to apply a relatively high 
mutation probability in the descendants let say 50%. 

3.2.5 Local Exhaustive Search 

A local exhaustive search technique is implemented if the system reached a local 
extreme before meeting the termination condition. In such a case the neighboring 
chromosomes of the most optimal up to then solution are examined as far as their 
fitness. Chromosomes that present equal or better fitness than the fitness of the most 
optimal up to then chromosome are passed on population replacement process. 

3.2.6 Replacement Strategy 

Chromosomes N population in each generation T remains constant. Once the 
descendants are produced, an adaptive replacement strategy is applied. Casel: During a 
generation where the system has not reached a local extreme. The pool of candidates 
for the next generation consists of the initial chromosomes and their descendants via 
the crossover operation. The best N chromosomes directly copied in the next 
generation. Thus, without mutation the system achieves a fairly rapid convergence 
towards a "good" extreme. Case2: During a generation where the system has reached a 
local extreme. The pool of candidates for the next generation consists of the initial 
chromosomes, their offspring via the crossover and mutation operation and the 
chromosomes that collected from the local exhaustive search. In the next generation 
passes a small number (elite) from the best initial chromosomes, while the remainder 
population is complemented by the best offspring chromosomes and those that 
collected from the local search. 



4 Experimental Part 

4.1 Training Phase 

For training and validation the system is using a database that contains one thousand 
(1000) music files, thirty (30) seconds each. Audio files are divided equally into ten 
(10) classes {blues, classical, country, disco, hiphop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, rock}, 
i.e. each class contains one hundred (100) music files. (Tzanetakis Music Collection 
[3], 10 Genres). Sampling frequency of all music samples was Fs = \ \Q25Hz . From 
each music track 81 features are extracted and then are converted to 81 similarity 



330 G.V. Karkavitsas and G.A. Tsihrintzis 

matrices. Each similarity matrix is representing the correlation between the 1000 
music files for a specific feature. These 81 similarity matrices constitute the training 
instances of an adjusted k-nearest neighbors classifier that the modified GA uses for 
rating the chromosomes. The classifier is evaluated as for his accuracy with leave one 
out cross validation method. Every time 999 music tracks used for training and 1 for 
classification. The class of music track that pending for classification is calculated 
using the k smallest equalized distance (nearest neighbors) from the others music 
tracks, as indicated by the white line in figure 2(a). The process is repeated until all 
tracks were used to train and classify (1000 loops for 1000 tracks). The process total 
error percentage is calculated as the mean of all experiments (Eq. 4).

E = Â£Â£,- (4) 

iooo Â£i 

Mean accuracy of classes constitutes the classifier's accuracy. Figure 2(d) shows 
the accuracy of k-NN classifier created using all 8 1 features, for various values of K 
nearest neighbors. 

Both the efficiency and the success of the Genetic algorithm feature selection 
method depend critically on a number of parameters, like Th, T, N, Pm, Pp, Ne, Nd. 
For parameters choice N = 80 chromosomes, T = 30 generations, Ne = 10 number of 
elit chromosomes, P p = 30 number of parent pairs, Pm = 0.5 mutation propability, 
Th=0.15 threshold decision whether the system has reached local extreme and Nd=3 
produce descendants in each genetic operation (two of the very multi-crossover and 
the first uniform), Genetic algorithm converges quite quicklv to the optimal solution 
(global minimum of the fitness function), from a set of 2 candidate solutions 
(Figure 2(b)). 

Figure 2(b) shows the best chromosome fitness (red color) in each generation (or 
differently the classification error (%) of the classifier produced by the best 
chromosome in each generation) and mean fitness (blue color) of all chromosomes in 
each generation. In generations 12, 17 and 20 there is a sharp increase in the mean 
fitness of chromosomes. This happened because the system reached a local extreme 
and to avoid it created several "controlled" randomized solutions probably with more 
useful individual genetic material, but with worse fitness. 

The modified hybrid Genetic Algorithm choose that a combination of 36 features 
provides better classification accuracy for a 16 nearest neighbors classifier. Figure 
2(c) shows accuracies of the K-NN classifier for different neigbours number K, which 
was created using the optimal number of features as selected by the GA (Maximum 
accuracy 67.6% for K = 16). The similarity matrix resulting from these 36 features is 
given in figure 2(a). 

With base the 36 features that were selected, Figure 3 shows the estimation and 
mapping of the music tracks positions (as entities) in three dimensional space. Some 
classes seems to be moving to a different level and do not overlap with others, such as 
classical music, which is spatial rather far from the "Pop" music. This is also 
illustrated in the confusion matrix (Table 1). However there are many classes that 
their contents are placed very close, even after feature selection, thus decreasing the 
accuracy of the classifier.

4.2 Confusion Matrix and Evaluation Metrics 

The classifier's Confusion Matrix is given in table 1. The columns correspond to the 
actual genre and the rows to the predicted genre. The percentages of correct 
classifications lie in the diagonal of the confusion matrix. The best predicted genres 
are classical and metal while the worst predicted are pop and rock. This is due to the 
fact that the pop and rock are very broad categories and their boundaries are fuzziest 
than classical or metal. 

Analyzing further the system's classifier, graphical representations of precision 
(degree of soundness, diagonal of the confusion matrix) [27] and recall (degree of 
completeness) [27] for all the classes that produced (figure 4).

each new to classification music file the selected features are extracted and they 
compared with the corresponding features of the database music files. A sixteen 
nearest neighbor classifier decides the new music file's class.

6 Summary - Conclusions - Future Work 



Accuracy of classification systems varies and depends on several parameters. Key 
elements that cause variations in a music gerne classification system accuracy is the 
quantity and diversity of music tracks used in the training phase and quantity and 
diversity of music classes that they belong. Another key element is the quality of the 
features that are extracted from the music tracks. These elements are giving shape and 
details in music surface. The first two key elements are constant and fixed in most 
music genre classification problems, since they actually constitute the problem. 
Features selection not only adds quality to features set by removing noisy music data 
and fuzzy features that make musical classes separation less distinct, but also reduces 
computational cost during the classification phase. Feature selection is a quite chaotic 
process, which means that adding a new feature in the original feature set may 
actually increase the classification accuracy, but it is likely this to happen for a very 
different mix of features. The basic idea is that the more features are available to a 
feature selection system, the better quality features it will choose and thus will create 
greater accuracy classifier. By using similarity matrices as training instances the 
system saves computational cost during the training phase. The modified GA was

developed exclusively for this system and managed to cope satisfactorily in both best 
solution selection and fast convergence. 

In the present work a kind of quantitative feature selection (selection or non- 
selection) was examined. A more detailed research would be a more qualitative 
feature selection. That is to say the features attendance in the classification with 
integer weights (instead of binaries) applied in each one of them. In this type of 
selection, the music surface would be more detailed because more features with more 
options may be selected but this will increase a lot the computational cost. 

Computational cost constitutes a great issue in music genre classification problems. 
Key reason for choosing Genetic Algorithms with k-nearest neighbors classifier for 
fitness evaluation and similarity matrices for training instances was their easy 
implementation to parallel programming. Parallel programming will give to the 
system a quite solid and detailed music surface so the system will provide a much 
better solution in much less time.

Abstract. Recently, computer networks, including the Internet, have emerged 
as one of the most important networks of society. Therefore, network security 
problems must be taken seriously. To improve the knowledge of security, there 
are various forms of security education. Exercises for network security provide 
the advantage of hands-on experiences of attacks. However, there is an ethical 
problem, that is, students learn not only the method of defense against cracking 
but also the method of attacking. In this research, to eliminate these problems, 
we developed a remotely accessible exercise system with a virtual cracker func- 
tion for generating automatic cracking. On realizing this system, learners will 
be able to experience and learn only the practical methods of defending net- 
works against cracking. 



1 Introduction 

In recent years, information security problems have become more serious, and educa- 
tional facilities such as universities and vocational schools provide various lectures 
for learning security. Such lectures consist of classroom lectures and exercises: the 
former is designed for learning offensive and defensive concepts systematically 
through books, and the latter is designed for experiencing real attacks and their de- 
fense via network equipment. 

In the latter case, however, it is troublesome to set up the networks for security ex- 
ercises by using actual equipment (Problem 1). 

Moreover, there is a problem in the exercises for defending attacks (Problem 2). 
There is a shortage of staff such as teachers and teaching assistants who generates at- 
tacks against students' networks. On the other hand, teaching students to generate at- 
tacks conflicts with ethical standards [1]. Alternatively, there is also another type of 
exercise: students construct networks and then defend their own networks against at- 
tacks generated by crackers in the Internet. In such exercises, however, students do 
not get stable experiences of attack and defense because there is a possibility that the 
crackers may not attack their networks.

We have developed a remotely accessible exercise system for conducting network 
security exercises [2], The system provides networks consisting of virtual machines 
with users through the Internet. Henceforth, a network consisting of virtual machines 
is called a "virtual machine network." The users can manage the networks from home 
using their PCs. Hence, the system can resolve Problem 1. 

Moreover, the system contains functions for constructing virtual machine networks 
and attacking them automatically. The system, however, fails to attacks networks up- 
dated by the management of the users, because this function is designed for running 
malicious software in each network apparatus only at the time of their initialization. 

For conducting network security exercises, we have proposed a remotely accessi- 
ble exercise system with a virtual cracker function to resolve Problem 2. The virtual 
crackers identify security holes by analyzing virtual machine networks, and then at- 
tack them. 



2 Related Studies 

Nakama developed a curriculum for network security and reported its practical results 
[3]. His students constructed experimental networks, which consisted of actual ma- 
chines, and connected them to the Internet. However, the report states: "Contrary to 
our expectation, we could suffer a few attacks from crackers in the Internet, and those 
attacks failed to achieve intrusion into our system." Conducting exercises that have 
accidental attack opportunities is a critical issue due to the time limitation of classes, 
although this idea is one of the solutions for addressing the issue of maintaining ethi- 
cal standards. 

Tele-lab IT security [4] is a virtual laboratory environment, in which students can 
learn to use network security tools. In this environment, students use attack/defense 
tools installed in the virtual machines running on servers; the students can access the 
exercise environment servers by using a browser and Virtual Network Computing 
(VNC) applets running at a remote location. SEED [5] is an exercise course that can 
be used to realize a virtual machine network for students. Students attack the network 
of their partners and defend their own network from attacks launched by their part- 
ners. Students can acquire more technical skills by using SEED than by using Tele- 
lab. However, these two applications do not address the issue of maintaining ethical 
standards (Problem 2). 

3 System Design 

3.1 System Overview 

Fig. 1 shows the construction of our system. It consists of a server machine (exercise 
server), which runs the virtual machine networks of the students, and client machines, 
which are used to operate the virtual machine networks. The clients display GUIs for 
the exercise on receiving them from the server. The virtual crackers attack the net- 
works in the server that are managed by the students by reading attack definition files 
(Section 3.3).

Fig. 1. System structure 

Scenario interpreter constructs the networks, which are assigned to the students, 
based on the network definition data in the scenario files. Before starting the exercise, 
teachers prepare scenario and attack definition files. After starting the exercise, stu- 
dents login to the server through their clients and manage the networks for a fixed 
period. 



3.2 A Remotely Accessible Exercise System for Network Security 

We have developed a system for exercising network management through virtual ma- 
chine networks; it consists of User-Mode Linux (UML) virtual machines [6], and it is 
called LiNeS (Linux Network Simulator). UML is a Linux emulator, and it is run on 
Linux OS. The virtual machine networks consist of virtual Linux servers, routers, cli- 
ents, and firewalls and virtual switching hubs. 

Furthermore, we constructed a server, which runs LiNeS and accepts remote opera- 
tion through VNC [7]. Therefore, the equipment required for a student to exercise is 
just a PC with VNC, connected to the Internet. In this study, using this server, we 
have implemented the exercise server in Fig. 1 . 

Students design network topologies via a GUI of LiNeS with mouse operations, 
and they set up virtual Linux servers and routers from their console windows, and vir- 
tual Linux clients using GUIs. 

LiNeS automatically constructs virtual machine networks based on network defini- 
tion data. Teachers can set network topologies and initial settings of virtual network 
apparatuses as network definition data. Using the initial settings based on which the 
virtual network apparatuses run and attack, LiNeS generates virtual networks, includ- 
ing virtual attacks. 



340 



Y. Tateiwa, T. Iwasaki, and T. Yasuda 



LiNeS, however, fails in attacking the networks that are updated by the manage- 
ment of the users, because the above method is designed for running the software in 
each network apparatus only at the time of their initialization. Accordingly, we have 
proposed the development of virtual crackers. 

3.3 Virtual Crackers 

Fig. 2 shows an attack flow which virtual cracker executes in our system. Virtual 
crackers act in each phase ((l)-(4)) based on the following information: A) time, B) 
execution results of attack tools, and C) state of virtual networks. A) means absolute 
and relative time. The absolute time is GMT and the relative time is the time elapsed 
since the exercise start time and the time when virtual crackers act. B) is the result of 
the nmap[8] port scan and the success or failure of the attacks by THC-Hydra[9] and 
Metasploit[10]. Interpreting the data, which is obtained through API2, the virtual 
crackers perform B). In C), the crackers analyze the information of virtual network 
apparatuses (for example, running process and server settings). After searching virtual 
network apparatuses via API1, obtaining information of the apparatuses by API2, and 
then analyzing the information, the crackers perform C). 

Virtual crackers act based on attack definition files in Fig. 2. The files consists of 
production rules using XML tags in Table 1. Event tags are used to define crackers' 
actions which are (l)-(4) in Fig. 2. Attributes are used to define their execution 
conditions. 

LiNeS has two APIs: one, API1, is designed for editing topologies of virtual ma- 
chine networks, and the other, API2, is designed for operating each virtual network 
apparatus. API1, for example, is used for adding new network apparatuses and chang- 
ing connections between existing network apparatuses. API2 is used for boot- 
ing/shutting down network apparatuses and executing Linux commands in virtual 
Linux servers, routers, firewalls, and clients.

4 A Prototype System 



A student operates LiNeS by establishing a VNC connection between his/her PC and 
an exercise server through the Internet. Fig. 3 shows an example of the display for an 
exercise. The student is using a Windows PC and operating a virtual machine network 
of LiNeS in a VNC viewer. 

The flow of the exercise is as follows: After the student selects a question that is 
shown by the system, the system constructs a network, which corresponds to the ques- 
tion, and provides the student with the corresponding network. After time passes, a 
virtual cracker starts to act based on an attack definition file. In this case, the virtual 
cracker carries out a SSH brute force attack against a server in the student's network. 
As the result, the server records logs, which are shown in Fig. 4. Furthermore, the vir- 
tual cracker creates a back door by using the root privilege obtained by the SSH 
attack. 

Subsequent actions of the cracker depend on the steps taken by the student. If the 
student destroys the backdoor or limits access to the server using the firewall after no- 
ticing the attack and the backdoor, the cracker would carry out DoS attacks against 
the server. Afterwards, the student will notice that he/she cannot browse the web 
pages in the server. As the result, the student starts dealing with the abnormal behav- 
ior of the server. 

On the contrary, if the student did not notice the attack at all or did not deal with it 
appropriately, the back door would be kept available. As a result, the cracker intrudes 
the server through the back door and deletes web pages illegally. Then, the student 
notices the abnormal state of the server when he/she cannot find the web pages. 
Hence, the student tries to identify the abnormal logs and deal with the attack.

5 An Evaluation Experiment 

5.1 Purposes of the Evaluation Experiment 



There are two purposes of this evaluation experiment. One is to validate the contents 
of the exercise based on/with respect to the skills/knowledge of the students. Our sys- 
tem targets those students who have the skills/knowledge of network construction and 
the foundation of network security. Therefore, we analyze the actions of the users in 
these exercises. 



A Remotely Accessible Exercise System for Network Security 343 

The other is to clarify the necessity and the effectiveness of the exercises generated 
by our system. We circulated questionnaires to gather opinion of subjects who have 
completed the exercises using our system after learning through classroom lectures. 

5.2 Summaries of the Evaluation Experiments 

The subjects consisted of 12 students who have experience of network construction. 
The authors were the experimenters. The procedures of the experiments are as 
follows: 

1. Each subject reads the answer books to understand the mechanisms and methods 
of DoS attacks, back doors, and buffer overflow. Furthermore, the experimenters ex- 
plain, when necessary, to help the subject understand the material. 

2. The subject is asked to manage a virtual network in the system for 20 min as a 
network security exercise. The experimenters record the behavior of the subject, 
which influences the results of the attack, while observing the subjects. The subject 
records the changes he/she makes to the network settings. 

3. The subject answers the questionnaire. 

Each subject provides the answer to a problem, which in this case is the secure 
management of a virtual machine network in our system. The virtual machine net- 
work has the same topology as shown in Fig. 3. 

The subjects have to manage their own networks such that the networks work as 
per the following: Since the role of the server is to publish web pages, it is required 
that the server runs WWW, FTP, SSH, and TELNET services. It is required that the 
client machine can upload web pages to the server by FTP, remotely login to the 
server by password authentication of SSH and TELNET, and set the WWW server 
software in the server. 

Furthermore, the subjects have to follow the following rules, which are called "ac- 
tion rules": 

â¢ All you can do to the server is view the configuration files under /etc, edit con- 
figuration files under /etc, except /etc/apache, and reboot the process of the services. 

â¢ All you can do to the firewall is interrupt communications from external hosts 
by ip tables. 

â¢ You must not edit the network topology and other machine settings. 

Needless to say, the subjects are not informed of the security holes of the server. 
The security holes are provided to permit remote login with root user, vulnerable 
passwords, and to run a process with buffer overflow vulnerability. 

5.3 Evaluation of the Validity 

Fig. 5 shows the action flow of a virtual cracker for the experiment. The virtual 
cracker decides its own actions, depending on the actions of subjects in the first and 
the next 10 min. 

Table 2 shows the relations between the actual actions of the cracker and the ex- 
pected actions of the cracker according to the actions of the subjects. No subject 



344 



Y. Tateiwa, T. Iwasaki, and T. Yasuda 



prevented the virtual cracker from attacking his/her network. In addition, there was 
not a single subject who did not take any step for network security. Therefore, this 
content is valid for these subjects.

5.4 Evaluation of the Necessity and Effectiveness 

We used the questionnaires illustrated in Table 3 with the following scale for evalua- 
tion: 5 - very much; 4 - a lot; 3 - somewhat; 2 - not much; and 1 - not at all. The 
questionnaire also contained space for comments. 

The results of Q.l and Q.2 indicate that the exercises generated by our system are 
necessary and effective in managing networks securely. We consider Comment B to 
be a problem of our system. For resolving this problem, we will develop a function to 
restrict the action of students in the system based on the settings made by the teachers.

Comments 



[A] Although I understood attack methods and defense methods each except for their rela- 
tions, I could not utilize them to network security. Such a practical exercise was impressive 
and helpful for me. 

[B] It is necessary to discuss the way to prevent students from violating the rules carelessly 
because there are no teachers in remote location. 



6 Conclusions 

In this study, we developed a network security exercise system for exercising only the 
ways to detect and defend attacks by introducing virtual crackers, which automati- 
cally generate attacks in our remotely accessible network security exercise system. As 
the result of the evaluation experiments, the behavior and evaluation questionnaires of 
the subjects indicate that our purpose is accomplished. Our future works will be fo- 
cused on developing user interfaces that help students to follow action rules, and to 
improve virtual crackers to enable them to generate more sophisticated and complex 
attacks.

Abstract. Biometrics is a process for identification of a person on the basis of 
physical and biological attributes. It has been highly developed to a stage where 
identification and authenti-cation of person is done through various means of 
biological features. However the major concerns in biometric is about obtaining 
a complete accuracy for verification and identification i.e. the false acceptance 
rate FAR and the false rejection rate FRR. Lip printing mechanism is an 
upcoming method which is now being used for identification in rare cases. In 
this paper we have proposed a methodology for a clear reading of lip print with 
the help of pattern matching using brute force algorithm. Multi biometrics 
technique are clubbed together to find a perfect solution for identification and 
verification. A lip print image is matched with the stored data-base and can be 
then used either for authentication or identification in crime case or can also be 
club with other authentication technique of biometrics to make stronger and 
robust authentica-tion mechanism. 



1 Introduction 

Biometrics is a process of reflex identification of a person based on his/her physio- 
logical or behavioral features. This method of recognition is preferred over conven- 
tional methods like passwords and PIN numbers as the identification based on 
biometric techniques obviates the need to remember a password or carry a token. It is 
an approach for life measurement and is related with distinctive physiological 
characte-ristics for identifying individuals. Biometrics emerged as a concept of 
security; it is used as the computer interface and pattern matching to identify an 
individual. A range of biometric applications are being used for authenticating 
person's identity. With the use of various features including fingerprints, face, 
signature, and iris, a person can be identified. Lip print, body odor, gait recognition 
[2] are some of the newly identified unique physical characteristics to identify an 
individual. Multi biometrics is used now days to increase the accuracy of biometrics 
models. Two different biometric are com-bined to give a more accurate model of 
authentication and identification such as face and fingerprint of same person, palm 
print and hand geometry, voice and lip move-ment are combined. The coalition is 
done either at the score level, sensor level or at feature level. Clubbing of two features 
set yields more accurate results due to inde-pendency of each other.

Here in this paper we have proposed a methodology for lip print recognition that 
can be used in forensics labs for identification of an identity. Lip printing recognition 
has its own merit such as small data requirement and quick pattern matching. The 
uniqueness of a lip-print is typically, determined by the overall pattern of grooves. 
Study of lip print is known as Cheiloscopy. Cheiloscopy is derived from the Greek 
words cheilos, lips, skopein, to see. It is the term given to the lip print studies. Lip 
prints can be recovered from various objects like glasses, cigarette etc. These evi- 
dences can be vital in cases of high complexity. Unfortunately the lip print analysis 
has not been developed substantially. The fact that every human has unique lip print is 
affirmed by Yasuo Tsuchihashi [1] and Olufemi [2]. In his paper the author investi- 
gated on various subjects to study the lip print and established the result that no lip 
prints showed the same pattern and even lip prints for twins are not identical. They 
have same integrity as that in fingerprints. 

A lip-print is a pattern of grooves that exist on the surface of the lips. Designing a 
reliable automatic lip print matching algorithm is quite challenging. However, the 
popularity of lip-print sensors is not yet developed and study in this area is still at a 
nascent stage. The critical factor with lip print matching is that they must satisfy with 
performance in terms of accuracy and processing speed. For the alignment of two lip- 
prints certain landmarks are needed. These should be automatically extracted with 
low misidentification rate. As landmarks we suggest is the prominent symmetry 
points (core-points) in the LIP PRINT. They are extracted from the complex 
orientation field estimated from the global structure of the LIP PRINT, i.e. the overall 
pattern of the grooves. Investigators often gain evidence through the use of 
Cheiloscopy. As in case fingerprints, experts can lift lip prints from objects found at 
crime scenes and compare these prints to a suspect's lip pattern. The remnants of the 
paper is organized as fol-lows: section (2) is about literature review section (3) 
focuses on methodology section (4) is about noise filtering section (5) is on pattern 
classification and matching, sec-tion (6) is the experimental result followed by 
conclusion and acknowledgment. 

2 Literature Review 

Study shows that there had been a smaller portion of work done in lip print technolo- 
gy. Personal identification with biological attribute is not an easy approach. The most 
common attributes used in this context are DNA and fingerprint, due to its accuracy 
and large database. Also because the above mentioned techniques has been estab- 
lished way back long, variety of scanners for the same are available in the market and 
is easy to install. Apart from the mentioned technique there are few more biometric 
techniques like iris scan, retina scan, hand geometry and facial recognition [2] but all 
have their own limitation. On one hand, where DNA gives more accurate measure- 
ments the fingerprint has highest usability due to large database and cost effective 
methodology. The external surface of lips has many elevation and depression forming 
a characteristic pattern called lip prints, also known as Cheiloscopy. The uniqueness 
of lip for each individual makes it an interesting area for pattern matching, identifica- 
tion and verification. Lip prints are helpful in forensic investigation that deals with 



Lip Print Recognition for Security Systems: An Up-Coming Biometric Solution 349 

identification of a victim in the court of law. More research work in this area need to 
be conducted with regards to confirmation of distinctiveness, and for the collection of 
evidences. 

With a rise in biometrics solutions for identification, verifications had pulled more 
attentions because they simplify the process methodology of traditional identification 
and verification. Considering the biological characteristics of physical attribute, hu- 
man luminescence plays an important role while searching of invisible evidence at the 
crime scene. In fingerprints extraction we use reagents for their localization. The lip 
prints which are left on crime scene may contain lipstick mark or an invisible impres- 
sion which act as a protective shield and doesn't leave any visible mark. Hence in 
case of lip print regular reagents cannot be used for the analysis. In a paper by Ana 
Castello [5] it is mentioned that Nile red can be used as a potential developer for lip 
prints. The results demonstrate that this reagent is highly effective even on one year 
old lip prints. A study conducted on a methodology of lip print mentions the 
procedures to maintain a database of lip print for verification purposes; it states that 
one can take the mark of lip prints on a suitable media like paper after application of 
lipstick or lip rouge. Also a high resolution photograph with focused and proper 
lightning at a particular angle can also be used. Different angles of lip prints can be 
taken to enable efficient matching. 

R.Fische was the first person to describe about the biological characteristics of lips. 
Edmond Locard, one of France's greatest criminologists, acknowledged the impor- 
tance of Cheiloscopy and first proposed that lip print can be used in identification and 
crime investigation. Japanese research on the subject of lip print established that ar- 
rangement of lines on the red portion of person's lips is unique for every individual. 

3 Methodology 

Lip prints recognition is relatively not fully formed in biometrics. No public data-base 
is available for it. To validate our proposed methodology, we have created a database 
of lip images of 200 individuals. We used Nikon 300 D 12.5 MP cameras. The analog 
signal output of the camera is transferred to the computer using a frame grabber 
PIXCI. The attainment was done at room temperature in an office environ-ment. The 
skin colors of the subjects varied from dark to fair and the subjects were people of 
different age group and geographical location varied from 20-60. Images were 
obtained for both the genders. We haven't made any classification on the basis of 
gender as earlier done by Shailesh M Gondivkar and others [3][4][5].Those with a 
disease or deformity has not been made part of this analysis. The percentage of failure 
was 0.2 for whom the system was unable to generate template which measures the 
proportion of individuals. 

The flow chart in Figure 1 represents the system's flow. The system started with 
image acquisition which in this case is the acquisition from the database. There would 
be two inputs one as a lip print of an individual which represents the stored database 
other as a lip print that needs to be verified. Both inputs are then processed to grooves 
and then the second input is matched against the first input to verify whether the lip 
print belongs to the same individual or not.

4 Lip Image Processing 

The extracted lip prints have a lot of unwanted details like the skin, hair etc. and ef- 
fected due to noise. Hence a pre processing is done [5] for contrast enhancement of 
images. It employs an adaptive filter that controls the contribution of the sharpening 
path in such a way that contrast enhancement occurs in high detail areas and little or 
no image sharpening occurs in smooth areas. We have used Median filter to remove 
noise [6] [7] [8]. We propose a physical diffusion process where the concentration 
balance depends upon the density gradient. In physical diffusion for the given image a 
(x,y,t) the diffusivity 'g' depends on the gradient as shown in (1) 



for V a â > Â°Â° 



(1) 



C â \for\ Val^O 

The gray value of each pixel is calculated iteratively depending on the gray value 
gradient in a 4-pixel neighborhood surrounding the pixel. The gradient is considered 
using the non-linear diffusion function 'c' so that the smoothing is more over the uni- 
form regions rather than the edges, and the edges remain sharp. 

5 Pattern Classification 



On studying the various obtained lip images we observed few patterns which were 
peculiar for each lip. The primary recognition is by the width and breath of upper and 
lower lips individually along with the kind of pattern which can be seen on the lips. 
The metrics of lips is measured and recognition is done by the kind of lips. We have 
classified lips into five major classifications (represented in the figures 3 to 7). Our 



Lip Print Recognition for Security Systems: An Up-Coming Biometric Solution 35 1 

analysis is in harmony with that of JO Kim [9], El Domiaty MA [10], Vahanwala 
Sonal [11], Renaud M [12]. The lip print was divided into six topographical areas and 
each area was examined alone to establish the type of the grooves as shown in 
figure 2.

Fig. 2. The division of lips 

Class I: The incomplete grooves which diminish gradually, as shown in Figure 3.The 
specialty of this class is that the lips are divided and distinct with the help of small 
patterns throughout the lips. 




Fig. 3. The incomplete grooves which diminish gradually 

Class II: The bifurcating grooves which form branch like structure as shown in 
Figure 4.These lips are more remarkable due to formation of stem like structure and 
divides it in small lines.

352 P. Sharma et al. 

Class III: The crossed grooves which have many intersections in its pattern as shown 
in Figure 5. These lips form an intercross web like structure giving it a differeent 
structure compared to other. It is more complicated in grooves structure and pattern. 




Fig. 5. Crossed Grooved 

Class IV: The grooves forming a net like design as shown in Figure 6. There net

Fig. 6. The Grooves Forming A Net Like Design 

Class V: These types of lip pattern doesn't have any distinct pattern and are 
arbitrary in nature as shown in Figure 7. Any other pattern which could not be 
classified in the above four falls under this category. 




Fig. 7. Unclassified Which Do Not Form Part Of Any 

After pattern classification of the lip print images the images are skeletonised so as 
to obtain the linear image of the lips which can be processed for pattern matching of 
the lips.

Fig. 8. Matlab veiw of region. 

Figure 8 shows a zoomed snapshot of the software "MATLAB (Ver. 7.0) used for 
processing on the basis of pattern of lip images. This pattern is matched as step of 
verification of our propose modality. We involved grooves segmentation [13] which 
normalizes lip print image and segments grooves region. It identifies grooves regions 
of a lip print image and returns a mask identifying this region. It also normalizes the 
intensity values of the image so that the grooves regions have zeroed mean, unit stan- 
dard deviation. 

5.1 Pattern Matching 

During the grooves matching the user lip image is acquired, processed and com-pared 
with the templates stored in the database. The user is accepted or rejected on the basis 
of the result of pattern matching. Pattern matching is the act of scrutiny for the 
presence of the constituents of a given pattern. We have tried to match this pattern 
with the help of Brute force algorithm. 

5.2 Brute-Force Algorithm 

The algorithm compares the pattern A with the stored lip patterns B in database for 
each possible shift of A relative to B until either 

â¢ A match is found or 

â¢ All placements of the pattern have tried 

The algorithm Brute Force Match BFM (A,B) is presented as follows: 

â¢ Image A of size o and pattern B of size p is given as input. 

â¢ The starting index of a string of A equal to B or-1 is obtained as output. 

â¢ If no such substring exists, shift i of the pattern is tested from to o-p. 

â¢ If j=p, match at 1 is found else no image match. 

6 Experimental Results 

Different threshold values were used for lip pattern matching to deduce the false 
acceptance rate and the false rejection rate. False Acceptance Rate refers to the total

number of unauthorized persons getting access to the system against the total number 
of people trying to use the system. False Rejection Rate refers to the total number of 
authorized persons not getting access to the system over the total number of people 
attempting to get access to the system. 

6.1 False Acceptance Ratio and False Rejection Ratio 

A sample from Person 2, P21 is tested against four samples from other persons with 
similar groves to some extent numbered P2, P3, P4, P5, and four other samples from 
Person 1 (Pll), Person 3 (P31), Person 4 (P41) and Person 5 (P51) with a completely 
different grove pattern. The results obtained are summarized in Table 1. The results 
are obtained from MATLAB ' s command window.

in Figure 9. The matching percentages are very close and high for sample P21 against 
four samples of similar groves while the matching results against sam-ples from other

persons are low. This is clearly depicted in the scatter graph. It is visible that the 
matching percentages between two samples of similar groves are higher and more 
than 28%. We found that the matching percentages between two samples of different 
groves are smaller than 6%. Therefore, a threshold can be set to determine whether 
two samples are from the same lip. This threshold is used to verify the lip prints as of 
the same person or a different person. 

Five samples from ten individuals are used and are tested against each of the 
sample. There are 200 verifications done in total. 

6.2 False Reject Rate (FRR) 

Authentic verification is a substantiation of the same entity. Matching percentage of 
genuine verification varies around a certain mean value. If a verification thre-shold 
that is too high is applied to the system, some of the genuine matching pairs are 
falsely rejected. Depending on the value of the threshold, the data that will be falsely 
rejected can be from zero to all images. 

False Rejection Rate (FRR) = Number of rejected data / total data. 

Table 2 shows the varying threshold values and the corresponding FRR obtained 
from the system's 200 verifications.

6.3 False Acceptance Rate (FAR) 

Depending on the choice of threshold, the arbitrary lip prints that are falsely ac-cepted 
by the system can be from none to all images. Impostor is an individual that is 
verified against a different stored database. 

False Acceptance Rate (FAR) = Falsely accepted data /Number of all impostor data 

Its value is one, if all impostor data are falsely accepted, and zero if none of the 
unknown data is accepted. Figure 11 shows the percentages of the FAR against 
different threshold values plotted using the data in Table 3.

6.4 Equal Error Rate (EER) 

By determining the Equal Error Rate (EER) the choice of the threshold value is made 
easier. EER is the value where the FAR and the FRR intersect and the value is equal 
for both rate. The EER of a system can be used to give a threshold inde-pendent 
performance measure. The lower the EER is, the better is the system's performance, 
as the total error rate which is the sum of the FAR and the FRR at the point of the 
EER decreases. The EER of this system is shown in Figure 12.

The EER of the system is approximately 15% as shown in figure 12. The threshold 
taken for verification is 22. 8. Using the determined threshold value as 23, the data 
obtained from 200 samples are considered. The number of times that the system re- 
sponds with correct and incorrect verification is counted. Total data counts are 200. 
There are six verifications of the same person rejected, while 15 verifications are 
falsely accepted. The total of correct verifications is 179. Verification rate is counted 
by taking the percentage of correct verifications over total data count. Therefore, the 
verification rate of this approach is 89.5%. Table 4 summarizes the data.

The rate of false acceptance and false reject can be influenced by several rea-sons. 
The reasons could be two different lip prints having the same principal lines, different 
illumination and also alignment of the lips on the capturing device. True negative rate 
which is the genuine rejection can also be influenced by having dif-ferent principal 
lines and also different lip sizes. 

7 Conclusion 

In this paper we have successfully implemented a modality based on unimodal 
biometric system for lip matching. It is an effort to understand how lip print recogni- 
tion can be effectively used in forensics for crime investigation. It is the basic work 
flow of lip print matching which includes various stages from lip extraction till 
the matching of the processed lip print data. A major challenge in lip print matching is 
the quality of images that are being used for processing and the efficiency of the 
algorithm used for fast retrieval of lip print data from the database. Lip print cannot 
be measured on the same scale as finger prints recognition regarding the data base. 
However de-spite this fact some countries have started collecting database for lip 
prints and are working to implement it in the fields of criminal identification. Some 
more research is needed in this upcoming entity identification process which can 
tackle complexities like changes in lip patterns due to ageing and seasonal changes. 

The lip print of a human is considered as personal identification and hence the 
analysis of lip print can help us in forensic investigation. Till date no standard metho- 
dology for lip print has been developed which has been accepted in the forensic 
science community.
