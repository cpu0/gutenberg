1 Getting Started 


This section describes how to start and configure the AIS Indexer. 

1.1 Installation and Setup 

The AIS Indexer is packaged in a .jar file and can be run from any location on the file 
system. It is recommended however that the jar file be placed in its own separate folder, 
e.g. AlS-Indexer, asit will make file navigation easier in the long run. 

In order to publish maps to the GeoNetwork site, a publisher script provided with the in¬ 
stallation package (zipped under GeoNetworkScript. zip) needs to be present somewhere 
on the local disk. The simplest solution is to place the script in a folder placed in the same 
folder as the jar file.

To setup the application requires running the jar file once by double clicking on it then clos¬ 
ing it (Figure 1 shows the AIS Indexer at startup). To close the application, simply click 
on the X button on the top-right comer of the window. Running the application will gener¬ 
ate 3 new subfolders (Config, Monitored Alerts, and Saved Maps). The screenshot in 
Figure 2 below shows a typical file stmcture after running the jar file. 

1.2 Installation and Setup 

Close the AIS Indexer and open the Config folder and the app. config file within. The 
HostName and Port parameters define the socket connection used by the AIS Indexer to 
retrieve live AIS messages. Replace localhost and 9999 respectively with the socket

Internet Protocol (IP) and port values you wish to connect to. Set the publisher path to the 
location of the publish. py script. See below for an example: 

PublisherPath=C:\Users\Username\workspace\AIS-Indexer\GeoNetworkScript\publish.py 

Note that the AIS Indexer must be run at least once to create the app. config file. 


1.3 Starting The Application From The Command Line 


Starting the application from the command line is not necessary but it does have some 
advantages, the most important of which is the ability to specify the amount of memory 
usable by the application. 

To do this (on the Windows Operating System), first open a command interface by typing 
cmd in the search bar right above the Windows button and then pressing Enter. The cmd 
path should point to C: \Users\Username by default. Use the cd <filepath> command 
to navigate to the AIS-Indexer folder. 

To run the application with a specified memory size (e.g. 1 Gigabyte (GB)) type: 

java -jar -XmxI024m AlS-Indexer.jar 

where -XmxI024 sets the maximal amount of memory used to 1024 megabytes (or 1GB). 
Large maps will require a lot of memory so this procedure is generally recommended.

2 Generating Maps 


This section explains how to generate maps using the AIS Indexer application. Figure 3 
illustrates the options left to the user from the Main Panel, generate a map or open an 
existing map. To start off map generation click the Generate Map button. 



Figure 3: The user can generate a new map or open an existing map. 


2.1 Options Panel 

After clicking on Generate Map, the user is presented with the choice of Static or Live 
map. Clicking on either one will reveal more options specific to the selected map type. 

2.2 Static Map Generation 

To generate a map from a static log file, use the file explorer to navigate to the file you wish 
to add and click the Add button in the bottom right corner. See Figure 4 for a view of the 
file explorer. Several files can be added when generating a single map, however the same 
log file cannot be included twice. 

Log files are not provided with the installation package. These files are generated by other 
scripts already in the possession of Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) 
(see annex of [2] for an example of such a file). 

The user can also include map-specific options in the options panel after selecting the map 
type. See Figure 5 for a screenshot of the option panel in the static case. For the static case, 
the user can specify the map’s start and end date, the geographic bounding box and the cell 
precision. The only mandatory field is the cell precision which dictates the resolution of the 
map. The smaller the cell size, the higher the map resolution. If the time and geographic 
bounds are not specified (all 0 or empty by default), the map will be generated with all 
the data available in the selected log file(s). Conversely, specifying geographic and time 
bounds will exclude the AIS reports in the logs, that are outside of the specified bounds.

Some restrictions apply when specifying bounds. In the case of time bounds, the end time 
must take place after the start time. In the case of geographic bounds, the northern latitude 
must be greater than the southern latitude and the eastern longitude must be greater than 
the western longitude. Furthermore, latitude values range between [-90.00, 90.00] degrees 
and Longitude values range between [-180.00, 180.00] degrees. 

By clicking the Run button, the map will be generated with the user specified options. 

2.3 Live Map Generation 

Generating live maps is similar to the static case with two major distinctions, the first 
is that all boundary options must be specified (there are no default values). The second 
difference is that for the live case the start and end times are replaced by the window period 
and refresh interval. The window period represents the length of time data are included 
in the map while the refresh interval represents how often the map will be generated. For 
example, a map can contain a total of 12 hours worth of AIS data (the window period), and 
can refresh every 4 hours.

3 Viewing Maps 


All maps are viewed in the Map Viewer window (see Figure 6). This interfaee allows the 
user to navigate the map by zooming with the mouse wheel and elieking and dragging the 
map in the same way he/she would use Google Maps ^. The Map Viewer also eontains a 
panel detailing all the speeifies of the eurrent map ineluding time and geographie bounds 
as well as monitoring info.

4 Loading Maps 


Whenever a map is generated by the AIS Indexer, it is automatieally saved in the Saved 
Maps folder as a text file. These text files ean be loaded at any time and viewed in a Map 
Viewer. 

To open a saved map, from the Main Panel, eliek on Open Map and use the file explorer to 
navigate to the map you wish to open, seleet it then eliek the Open button. See Figure 7 for 
a view of the file explorer.

5 Monitoring Ship Traffic 


From the Map Viewer interface, the user can also monitor live ship traffic. Monitoring 
uses the same socket connection as live map generation however the two processes are 
completely separate. In short, monitoring ship traffic compares incoming AIS messages 
to the current map. If a message originates from a cell with a strong reception index, the 
ship that reported the message will be expected to report again. If it doesn’t, an alert will 
appear on the right hand panel of the Map Viewer. The user will also be alerted of ships 
that reappear after having been reported as missing. For a more detailed description of how 
monitoring works, refer to [2]. 

The monitoring panel includes the option to set the index threshold for ships to be mon¬ 
itored. AIS messages that originate from cells with indices below this threshold will be 
ignored. 

When an alert appears, selecting it will place a marker on the map indicating the position 
of origin of the AIS report that triggered the alert. See Figure 8 for an example of the alerts 
list and display on the map. 

All alerts are saved to a file in the Monitored Alerts folder. These files represent a 
monitoring session. A session starts when the monitoring button is toggled on and ends 
when it is toggled off or the user closes the Map Viewer.

6 Publishing Maps To GeoNetwork 


From the Map Viewer, the user ean also publish the eurrent map to the GeoNetwork website 
by elicking on the Publish to GeoNetwork button. In the ease of live maps, the button is 
toggable and maps will be published as they continue refreshing. In the case of static 
and loaded maps, the button can simply be clicked once to publish the map. The Publish 
to GeoNetwork button is in the left part of the Map Viewer (see Figure 6 and 8). This 
functionality assumes that GeoNetwork is up and running on the network. Refer to [3] for 
more details about the publishing functionality. 

The user is warned however to avoid publishing live maps with high refresh rates. For ex¬ 
ample, if a map that refreshes every 2 min is left running for one hour, then the GeoNetwork 
site will have received 30 publications by the end of the hour. Deleting these publications 
must be done case by case and can become tedious. To facilitate long term maintenance, it 
is therefore preferable to publish sparingly.
