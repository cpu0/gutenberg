1 Code Description 

The Conservation Element and Solution Element (CESE) method [1, 2] was used as implemented in the 
NASA research code ez4d [3]. The CESE method is a time accurate formulation with flux-conservation 
in both space and time. The method treats the discretized derivatives of space and time identically and 
utilizes a staggered mesh approach consisting of conservation elements (CE) and solution elements (SE). 
While high-order versions of the method exist [4, 5, 6], the 2nd-order accurate version was used. In regards 
to the ez4d code, it is an unstructured Navier-Stokes solver coded in C m with serial and parallel versions 
available. As part of its architecture, ez4d has the capability to utilize multi-thread and Messaging Passage 
Interface (MPI) for parallel runs. 

2 Meshes 

Three sets of meshes were used for the computations: the 2D and randomly perturbed (RP) meshes provided 
by the workshop and a set of meshes made from scratch using Pointwise®. The meshes made from scratch 
were formed by producing a uniformly spaced structured grid and then diagonalizing it by dividing each cell 
into two triangular cells using the “best fit” option within Pointwise®. The 2D and RP meshes used grid 
levels 3 and 4 while the diagonalized structured (DS) meshes used grid levels 3 through 5. Domain sizes for 
the various meshes are shown in Table 1. For the boundary conditions (be), periodic boundary conditions 
were applied to the left and right boundaries of the domains while a non-reflecting boundary condition was 
applied to the top and bottom boundaries of the domains. Additional cases using the DS meshes were run 
with periodic boundary conditions for all boundaries of the domains.

3 Case Summary 

Cases utilizing the non-reflecting boundary condition were run on a single Intel Xeon W3680 core with times 
for running the TauBench executable ranging from 7.957s to 8.415s with an average of 8.124s. Cases utilizing 
only the periodic boundary condition were run on twelve Intel Xeon X5670 cores (NASA Pleiades, Westmere) 
with times for running the TauBench executable ranging from 8.697s to 8.741s with an average of 8.719s. 
All cases were run out to a equivalent time of 50 time periods and only the fast vortex initial condition was 
run. 


4 Results 

4.1 Contour Plots 

Non-dimensional u velocity contours for the fast vortex problem are shown in Fig. 1 through Fig. 4. Note 
that the velocity contours are non-dimensionalized by the freestream u velocity. It can seen that the vortex 


1 


core strength decreases over time and that the vortex as a whole drifts down and to the right. Trends are 
similar for all grid and boundary condition sets and mesh refinement shows improvement in minimizing both 
the vortex core strength decay and the vortex drifting.

4.2 Workshop Metrics 

The workshop requires the L2 norm of the u and v velocity errors of the 50 time period solution to be 
computed and compared to the work units and length scale for each grid. The u and v velocity L2 norms 
were computed as follows:

The work units were defined as the time it took ez4d to run the entire simulation normalized by the time it 
took to run the TauBench executable.

Following suite, the length scale was defined as follows: 


VnDOF cells 

Figure 5 shows the u velocity errors verses work units and length scale while Fig. 6 shows the v velocity 
errors verses work units and length scale. It can be seen that the velocity errors are mostly independent 
of the grid configuration (i.e. 2D, RP, DS) and only dependent on the number of grid cells. Also, it can 
be seen that the velocity errors are nearly independent of the boundary condition applied to the top and 
bottom of the domains. As expected, the u and v velocity errors decrease with decreasing length scale (and 
subsequently with increasing work units).
