TECHNICAL REPORT 



The 

RICIS 

Concept 


The University of Houston-Clear Lake established the Research Institute for 
Computing and Information systems in 1986 to encourage NASA Johnson Space 
Center and local industry to actively support research^ in the computing arid 
information sciences. As part of this endeavor, UH-CIear Lake proposed a 
partnership with JSC to jointly define and manage an integrated program of research 
in advanced data processing technology needed for JSC’s main missions, including 
administrative, engineering and science responsibilities. JSC agreed and entered info 
a three-year cooperative agreement with UH-Clear Lake beginning in May, 1986, to 
jointly plan and execute such research through RICIS. Additionally, under 
Cooperative Agreement NCC 9-16, computing and educational facilities are shared 
by theTwo institutions to con duct t Ke resea rch. -- - 

The mission of RICIS is to conduct, coordinate and disseminate research on 
computing and information systems among researchers, sponsors and users from 
UH-Clear Lake, NASA/JSC, and other research organizations. Within UH-Clear 
Lake, the mission is being implemented through mferdiscipl inary involvement of 
faculty and students from each of the four schools: Business, Education, TTumah 
Sciences and Humanities, and Natural and Applied Sciences. 

Other research organizations are involved via the “gateway” concept. UH-Clear 
Lake establishes relationships with other universities and research organizations, 
having common research interests, to provide additional sources of expertise to 


conduct needed research. 

A major role of RICIS is to find the best match of sponsors, researches and 
research objectives to advance knowledge in the computing and Information 
sciences. Working jointly with NAS A/ JSC, RICIS advises on research needs, 
recommends principals for conducting - the^^arch, provides technical and 
administrative support to coordinate the research, and integrates technical results 
into the cooperative goals of UH-Clear Take and NASA/JSC. T“”

Preface 


Ada/POSIX Binding 


NASA is seeking an Operating System Interface Definition (OSID) for the Space 
Station Program (SSP) in order to take advantage of the commercial 
off-the-shelf (COTS) products available today and the many that are expected 
in the future. NASA would also like to avoid the reliance on any one source 
for operating system, information system, communication system or Instruction 
set architecture. One possible solution is to use the Portable Operating 
System Interface for Computer Environments (POSIX). Since Ada is already the 
language of choice for SSP, the question of an Ada/POSIX binding is an 
appropriate one. 


Background 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Formerly National 
Bureau of Standards) has adopted an interim Federal Information Processing 
Standard (FIPS) for POSIX, based on the IEEE Draft 12 of the standard. The 
final standard will be similar to the IEEE POSIX standard, based on Draft 13 
which was recently approved by the IEEE P1003.1 Review Committee as a full-use 
standard. 

There is an International Standards (ISO) Working Group (WG) 15 whose charter 
is to make POSIX an international standard. They will use the IEEE standard 
as , a D “^5 t * J heir next vork item is to define a standard binding between Ada 
and POSIX. They will use the work done by the IEEE WG P1003.5 as a draft for 
the Ada/POSIX binding standard. 


Overview 

According to Stowe Boyd, Co-chairman of the IEEE P1003.5 Working Group, the 
intent of the binding is to provide access to the POSIX standard operating 
system (OS) interface and environment, by which application portability of Ada 
applications will be supported at the source code level. A guiding principle 
of Ada/POSIX binding development is a clear conformance of the Ada interface 
vith the functional definition of POSIX. The interface is intended to be used 
by both application developers and system implementors. The objective is to 
provide a standard that allows a strictly conforming application source 
program that can be compiled to execute on any conforming implementation. 
Special emphasis is placed on first providing those functions and facilities 
that are needed in a wide variety of commercial applications. 

The following areas are outside of the scope of the P1003.5 standard: 

User interface (?hell) and associated commands 

Network protocols 

Graphics and windowing interfaces 

Database management system interfaces 

Object or binary code portability

PRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED 


Dr. Charles McKay, Director of the Software Engineer! 
University of Houston - Clear Lake, has proposed the 
using an Ada/POSIX binding in the NASA OSID: 


ng Research Center, 
following criteria for 


1. The OSID should be baselined as a catalog of interface features and 
options which would include more than the issues addressed by the Dresent 
™ S1 l standard - Each NASA location would use those portions of the binding 
which are appropriate to the work being done, and extend or replace those 
portions as they are appropriate. 


2. The OSID will reflect Ada packages which are loosely coupled and tightly 
cohesive. That is, the logically related units will have a minimum 
interdependence upon one another and will be closely related in their internal 
rune t lonali ty for providing services and resources. 

3. An appropriate Ada/POSIX binding will provide an abstract interface 

specification which hides all implementation details beneath the interface 
from all compilation units of the application software and major application 
support sub-systems. vv 


4. The OSID would include an abstract interface specification which would 
enable the construction of a validation test suite to insure conformance to 
all features and options in the catalogue mentioned in item 1.

Stowe Boyd, Co-Chairman of the IEEE Ada/POSIX Working Group, stated that they 
hoped to have the binding resolved by the end of 1989. H«r cautioned, however, 
that much depended on the time required for IEEE balloting and resolution of 
balloting issues. Interested parties should contact him in order to 
participate in the balloting.
