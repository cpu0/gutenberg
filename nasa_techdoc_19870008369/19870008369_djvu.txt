MANNED MARS MISSION SCHEDULE REPORT 

W. Ferguson, J. Robinson. C. Calfee

ABSTRACT 

This section contains the schedules for hardware for the initial 
manned Mars mission. The mission for the purpose of this report is 
determined to be a 1999 opposition mission and the vehicle hardware 
configuration for the mission is as depicted In Figure 1. 
BACKGROUND 

NASA has experienced phenomenal success in its brief history with 
the major programs of Saturn (I. IB. and V), Skylab. Shuttle, and 
Spacelab. Prior to the flight of a manned Mars mission, it Is 
anticipated that the Space Station, Shuttle Derived Vehicle (SDV) . and 
Orbital Transfer Vehicle (OTV) will have become operational. It is also 
anticipated that DOD will be well into the Strategic Defense Initiative 
(SDI) development and operation by the year 1999. and that NASA will have 
a large role in the development and operation of hardware for that 
system. Accepting the challenge for manned Mars missions will be one 
that NASA is equally qualified for and willing to assume. 

During the late 1960's, NASA performed in-depth studies of various 
Mars missions. A large portion of the data generated as a result of 
those studies can be utilized for a future definition study for manned 
Mars missions. As mentioned earlier, the development of 
technology/hardware through these other programs will be of tremendous 
benefit through the reduction of development time and cost to the manned 
Mars program. 

This paper attempts to cover all facets of the initial manned Mars 
mission for this particular launch vehicle configuration. The program 
begins with definition studies and continues with schedules for hardware 
necessary for reaching Mars and returning to Earth. Since 
hardware/software is the most tangible criteria from a scheduling 
standpoint, seven categories of hardware were selected for analysis. 
These categories are as follows: (1) Rocket Vehicles; (2) Spacecraft; 
(3) SDV-3R Payload Adapters; (4) Experiments; (5) LEO Assembly

Equipment; (6) Training Hardware and Facilities; (7) Mission Control 
and Communications Network. 

Launch site facilities were not covered, since it is assumed that 
these facilities will be In existence from other national space booster 
programs such as SDV. SDI . etc. In the time allocated for this study, 
schedule information for a large number of vehicle configurations was not 
developed nor would it have been desirable to do so at this time. 
Instead, one vehicle was selected that seemed most feasible to be 
developed by the 1997/1988 (start LEO operation 1997 and start Earth 
departure 1998) time period. 
SCHEDULES 

(Refer to Figures 2 through 8) 
METHODOLOGY 

Nine flights of the SDV-3R vehicle are required to place all 
hardware/equipment, including propellant into Low Earth Orbit (LEO). 
These flights will be scheduled as required to optimize the assembly at 
LEO. The SDV hardware to be recovered from these flights are the 
Propulsion/Avionics (PA) modules and the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs). 
however, there is Insufficient time for these hardware items to be refur- 
bished and reused for the remaining SDV-3R flights on the same manned 
Mars mission. An airplane will be leased to return the PA modules from 
the recovery site to the refurbishment site. 

Five STS missions are planned for the crew during the manned Mars 
mission. Included are two assembly crew rotations required in LEO plus 
the placing of the flight crew into orbit and return. An OTV flight will 
be made available for rendezvousing with the manned Mars vehicle upon 
Earth return and transferring the crew to LEO to rendezvous with the 
Space Station or the Orbiter. 

The power subsystem for the mission has not be selected. If a 
nuclear or isotope system is selected it will be imperative that early 
go-ahead be given for definition studies as these systems require very 
long lead times. (Refer to Table 1 for estimate of development time for 
various power systems.) 

Orbital assembly of the space vehicle could require up to a year In 
duration, however, LEO assembly has not been totally assessed, therefore, 
this ample schedule cushion has been included. If this assembly is

accomplished away from the Space Station, a control module will serve as 
a work station for the astronauts. It Is anticipated that a multitude of 
operations will be required. These operations may utilize mechanized 
arms, robotics, and the OMV, and will require extensive EVA activities. 
The mission modules could serve as the habitation module for the 
astronauts during the assembly period. 

Experiment operations could begin In LEO during assembly operations 
and continue until Earth return. 

Extensive training hardware will be required for the manned Mars 
mission. In each applicable category of hardware, test and training unit 
deliveries will precede the flight unit deliveries. 
ASSUMPTIONS 

o No test flights are planned prior to a manned landing, 
o Optimum Mars launch windows occur on approximately 2 year intervals, 
o SDV-3R vehicle, manufacturing/test facilities and launch facilities 

development are not planned under this program (assume previous 

development) . 
o All flights planned in support of the manned Mars mission are in 

addition to the STS Program of 24 flights per year, 
o Test and training unit deliveries precede the flight unit deliveries 

shown above, 
o OTV is assumed to be in existence and available by 1997 (includes 

aerobraking shield) . 
o OMV is assumed to be In existence and available for assembly 

operations by 1997-98. 
o Habitation and logistics modules used for LEO assembly will be 

copies of then existing SS modules, 
o LEO assembly equipment is Independent of existing Space Station 

equipment, 
o The launch vehicle SE&I contractor will also be responsible for the 

payload adaptors, vehicle GSE, vehicle software and vehicle 

Integration hardware, 
o Existing neutral buoyancy facilities are adequate with judicious 

scheduling.

RISK ASSESSMENT 

With the assumptions previously listed, the SDV-3R vehicle schedule 
should represent only a minimum risk. Early go-ahead Is required for 
definition studies for the Space Transportation Main Engine (STME) for 
the Earth LEO departure stage and the RLIOO engine for the Mars departure 
stage. Per previously mentioned assumptions, the OTV with Its 
aerobraklng shield and the OMV will have been developed by the tine of 
the manned Mars mission. Early go-ahead is required for power systems for 
the spacecraft, particularly if nuclear or isotope systems are to be 
utilized. 
CONCLUSION 

In conclusion, it appears realistic from a schedule standpoint that 
a pre-2000 manned Mars mission is possible. However, it will be 
imperative that early go-ahead with adequate funding authorization be 
given so that the necessary planning and definition studies can be 
initiated for the long lead hardware.
