Artificial Intelligence: 
A New Productivity Tool 

Building on the 4404 Al System, Tek now 
broadens its Al family to include the 4405 
with increased processing power and the 
4406 with its high speed 16 MHz Motorola 
68020 32-bit microprocessor and 68881 co- 
processor. The Tek Al family offers a power- 
ful range of capabilities for application de- 
velopers, researchers, software engineers, 
and computer scientists at prices well be- 
low the industry norm. 

The 4400's advanced languages make it an 
excellent exploratory programming and soft- 
ware prototyping tool. 

All of the major Al lanaguages in use today 
are represented on the 4400 including Tek 
Common LISP, Smalltalk-80, MProlog and 
Franz LISP. This offers Al researchers and 
developers a clear choice of programming 
environments— all accessible from a single 
desktop device, all fully compatible with the 
entire 4400 Series Artificial Intelligence 
Systems. 

A quick review of the specifications (see 
box) clearly shows the preformance of the 
new 4406 and 4405 is comparable to sys- 
tems that cost significantly more. AIM ex- 
pects these new Al systems, based on 
optimized architecture and powerful, low- 
cost, general-purpose components, to cap- 
ture a major portion of emerging Al market 
because of their outstanding price/per- 
formance.

4404 Al System 

The Tektronix 4404 Artificial Intelligence Sys- 
tem provides a powerful, highly interactive 
environment for Al research and develop- 
ment. A low-cost desktop system, the 4404 
sets a new price/performance standard for 
Al applications such as expert systems, nat- 
ural languages, vision systems, theorem 
proving, intelligent robotics and automatic 
programming. 



The 4404 comes standard with a high-speed, 
proprietary implementation of Smalltalk-80, an 
extensible, object-oriented language which 
supports rapid prototyping and exploratory 
programming. Smalltalk-80, in conjunction 
with the 4404 display capabilities, offers the 
most sophisticated user interface available for 
Al program development. 

A bit-mapped graphics display with mouse 
input is closely coupled to the processor for 
a state-of-the-art user-interface. The 13-inch 
monochrome display has a 640 x 480 pixel 
resolution and operates at 60 Hz, noninter- 
laced. It functions as a window into a 1024 x 
1024 bit-map memory with smooth panning 
whenever the cursor reaches a physical dis- 
play edge. The bit-mapped display facili- 
tates advanced concepts such as overlap- 
ping windows, "pop-up" menus and pointing 
with the mouse, Graphics performance 
makes screen animation possible. The full 
keyboard provides programmable function 
keys and a joydisk. 

NEW 4405 Al System 

The Tektronix 4405 Artificial Intelligence Sys- 
tem joins the Tek 4404 and 4406 to offer a 
complete family of Al application develop- 
ment toools and delivery systems. The Tek 
4405 offers a complete, state-of-the-art, per- 
sonal Al development system that rivals 
units costing much more. 

Delivering significantly more processing 
power than the 4404, the 4405 is ideally suit- 
ed for larger Al efforts. It provides all the 
software and hardware capabilities needed 
for developing major artificial intelligence 
programs. 



As with the 4404, the Smalltalk-80 program- 
ming environment is included standard with 
the 4405. This exploratory programming tool 
offers a highly integrated, object-oriented 
user interface and is ideal for quick proto- 
typing of complex images. It includes text 
and graphics editors, incremental compiler, 
debugging tools and multiple-window man- 
agement capabilities. 

NEW 4406 Al System 

The Tektronix 4406 Artificial Intelligence Sys- 
tem is the highest performance member in 
the compatible 4400 Series Al Systems. The 
4406 has the power and memory to handle 
even the most complex Al programs with 
speed and efficiency. The system includes 
a 32 Mbyte virtual memory address space, a 
full 2 Mbytes of dynamic RAM (expandable 
to 6 Mbytes) and a 90 Mbyte hard disk. The 
optional 4944 Mass Storage Unit further en- 
hances 4406 performance by providing in- 
cremental 90 Mbyte hard disk backup. 

The 4406 inherits the innovative design and 
advanced manufacturing techniques pio- 
neered by the 4404. Employing VLSI archi- 
tecture and 32-bit data paths, the 4406 is 
nearly twice as powerful as the 4404. It is 
equally appropriate for Al research, applica- 
tion development, or as a cost effective de- 
livery system. 

Al Programming Environments 

The 4406 supports all of the popular Al pro- 
gramming languages in use today. Small- 
talk-80, Tek Common LISP, MProlog, and 
Franz LISP all run on the 4406. Programs de- 
veloped on the Tektronix 4404 and 4405 are 
upwardly compatible with the 4406.

Smalltalk-80 


Extensible, Object-Oriented Programming 


Bit-Mapped Graphics User Interface 


Designed for Exploratory Programming 



Smalltalk combines an object-oriented pro- 
gramming language with the most ad- 
vanced user-interface available, Pioneered 
at Xerox PARC, Smalltalk permits explor- 
atory programming through rapid 
prototyping and experimentation. Smalltalk 
provides an interactive approach to solving 
complex problems. 

High Performance Implementation 

Tektronix' method of implementing Small- 
talk-80 combined with the powerful hard- 
ware architecture of the 440 Series, pro- 
vides graphic response fast enough to sup- 
port screen animation under direct control 
of Smalltalk. 

Smalltalk satisfies the needs of program- 
mers in the Al field. It is ideal for Artificial 
Intelligence research and development. 
Smalltalk can be extended by defining new 
instances of an object class (each with its 
own internal state) or by defining an entirely 
new object class with a distinct set of rules 
and default behavior. The class structure of 
Smalltalk provides both multiple inheritance 
and hierarchical inheritance mechanisms. 
Over 200 predefined classes support the 
data and control abstractions most com- 
monly used in Al applications development. 

Original Windowing System 

Bit-mapped graphics and window manage- 
ment were originally developed for 
Smalltalk. The Smalltalk "Model-View-Con- 
troller" window-based manager supports 
the creation of new window-based applica- 
tions. Multiple processes are supported with 
a virtually unlimited number of overlapping 
windows. 

Smalltalk supports primitive graphic func- 
tions such as scaling, translation, rotation, 
logical combination of pixels and text 
attribute modification through its integral 
"BitBIt" operator. 

Virtually any activity— text editing, file ma- 
nipulation, compilation, execution, de- 
bugging — can be performed at any time, re- 



gardless of the current state. The user sim- 
ply "opens" another window and proceeds 
with the new operation. Smalltalk allows im- 
mediate access to any of its subsystems, 
whether user-defined or predefined, for in- 
spection or modification. 

MPROLOG' 

Configured for 4400 Series Al Systems 
Interactive Development Support 
Modular Development Capability 

MProlog, as implemented on the 4400 Se- 
ries, is a unique language that allows pro- 
grammers to solve problems by specifying 
what answers are needed rather than de- 
scribing a detailed solution procedure. 
MProlog is non-procedural, based entirely 
on logical relationships or rules, among an 
assortment of facts. 

MProlog operates on the principle of "con- 
trolled deduction." The programmer creates 
a network of facts and rules that describe 
the known relationships between the 
elements of a problem. Once the logical 
network is defined, MProlog makes logical 
inferences from the relationships when que- 
ried by the programmer. These characteris- 
tics make MProlog ideal for many Al applica- 
tions including expert systems, natural 
language processing, data base query lan- 
guages and automatic programming systems. 

Performance for Complex Problems 

MProlog makes complex problems easier to 
solve and reduces program development 
time. The inherent efficiency of MProlog is 
enhanced by the power of the 4400 Series 
hardware The MProlog system is an ideal 
vehicle for both software development and 
end-user Al applications. PROLOG is one of 
the acknowledged languages in artificial in- 
telligence technology. Now, Tektronix adds 
the programmer productivity and applica- 
tion development tools needed to move Al 
into the marketplace.

TElC Common LISP 

A Full Common LISP Implementation 

Optimized for 4400 Systems 

Rapid Prototyping of Al Concepts 

Run-Time Compiler for Optimized Machine 
Code 



Tek Common LISP has been specifically op- 
timized and enhanced for performance on 
the Tektronix 4400 Series. It provides Al re- 
searchers and software developers with a 
personal LISP programming environment 
previously available only on dedicated LISP 
machines. 

Common LISP was conceived by a large 
committee of academicians and Al research- 
ers as a language that would incorporate the 
very best features of other LISP dialects. Tek 
Common LISP is a full implementation of this 
language (as specified in "Common LISP, The 
Language" by Guy Steele). It offers a much 
richer set of data types and more complex 
program structures than other LISP dialects 
currently in use. 

A New Standard 

Common LISP is considered by many artifi- 
cial intelligence experts to be a new indus- 
try standard for Al programming environ- 
ments. This consensus is reflected in the 
general parameters established for the 
language: 

COMMONALITY: Common LISP focuses 
the features of several different implemen- 
tations of LISP into a common dialect. 

PORTABILITY: Applications written in 
Common LISP are easily ported to any Com- 
mon LISP implementation. 

EXPRESSIVENESS: Common LISP is a 
very rich language that employs the most 
valuable constructs from other LISP 
dialects. 

EFFICIENCY: Common LISP has features 
designed to facilitate the production of fast, 
high-quality compiled code. 

COMPATIBILITY: Since Common LISP is 
derived from a number of popular dialects, 
code from other LISP dialects should readily 
map into Common LISP. 

Additional Tek Common LISP Features 
Include: 

A powerful optimizing compiler with built-in 
debugging features; lexically scoped inter- 
preter and compiler; full featured package 
system for symbol name differentiation; rich 
collection of numerical primitives and built-in 
functions; built-in garbage collector and dy- 
namic storage management; complete im- 
plementation of arrays, vectors and strings; 



flexible interactive user interface; flexible 
debugging aids; powerful facilities for struc- 
tures and macros; lexical closures; user-ex- 
tensible data type facility; and built-in user- 
extensible data type facility; and built-in 
user-extensible parser and hash-table 
facility. 

The rich set of primitives available in Com- 
mon LISP makes the language an appropri- 
ate candidate for expert systems, natural 
language interfaces, and all types of sym- 
bolic programming. Tek Common LISP goes 
beyond the specifications of the language 
to provide on-line documentation; a user-de- 
finable error handler; powerful and robust 
foreign function interfaces to C and FOR- 
TRAN programs and a built-in Flavors sys- 
tem for object-oriented programming.

FRANZ LISP 



Configured for 4400 Al Systems 

Full-Featured Development Language 

Optimizing Compiler Generates 4400 Series 
Machine Code 



A commercial derivative of the MacLISP lan- 
guage from MIT, FRANZ LISP is the long- 
time favorite for Al programming because of 
its uniqueness as a high-level machine lan- 
guage for symbolic processing. Many natu- 
ral languages and expert systems have 
been built using the recursive programming 
facilities of LISP. Traditionally, LISP has re- 
sided only on expensive mainframe comput- 
ers. Now, Franz LISP is available on the 
4400 Series Artificial Intelligence Systems. 

A Powerful Al Programming Environment 

4400 Series LISP is a programming environ- 
ment that includes many tools to enhance 
research and development. Besides the 
popular language primitives, functions and 
data types, LISP contains a powerful macro 
facility, and allows programs written in other 
languages to be called. The system sup- 
ports separately compiled functions, UNIX- 
like file accessing, and I/O redirection. 

Franz LISP supports a wide variety of data 
types, arithmetic and mapping functions. 



The language provides dynamic storage al- 
location and garbage collection. It provides 
operators for creation, accessing, and ma- 
nipulation of data types, data type determi- 
nation, and structure comparison. Users 
may create their own data types out of vec- 
tors and specify how standard system func- 
tions, like print, should handle them. 

Franz LISP provides simple arithmetic func- 
tions, arithmetic predicates, trigonometric 
functions, "bignum" functions and a host of 
conversion and special purpose arithmetic 
functions. It includes a set of operators to 
allow dynamic error indication and recovery, 
with nonstandard control flows, through 
the powerful catch, throw and errset 
functions. 

Franz LISP in the 4404 environment provides 
many functions for communicating with I/O 
devices, including I/O redirection to and 
from files. It supports UNIX-like disk file op- 
erations such as direct file access with the 
fseek function, allowing reading or writing 
at random locations within a file. 

Many system functions allow interaction 
with internal components of LISP and the 
operating system. These include new pro- 
cess generation from within a program with 
the process and signal functions.
