13. ABSTRACT (Maximum2(M} wads) 

In March 99, a contract was placed with I-Kinetics, Inc., to design and develop software components frcMn AFRL legacy 
a{^lications. Die contractor was planning to advance their ComponentFirst methodology throu^ application to Air Force 
legacy software integration problems. After developing and maturing I-Kinetics's Data Fusion Component Factory, they 
would tiansfonn a set of Air Fonce legacy assets into Data Fusion components suitable for deployment. The contractor had 
difficulties in determining exactly how the AFRL codes were wirtten and, therefore, had problems in developing an actual 
product that could demonstrate the new computing environment. When the extractor lost key investigators, tlK contract was 
descoped to just cover the work performed.

Subject: Summary of Accomplishment 
Contract: F19628-99-C-0024 


This Summary of Accomplishment covers the time period from start of contract through 31-January-2000, 
the revised end date, of the performance period. 

1. Research and Design Methodology Process and Practice 

1. Accomplished advancement of component-centered design and analysis of distributed object systems 
using I-Kinetics ComponentFirst methodology. 

2. Identified and analyzed emerging component fiamewoiks. Of particularly significance was the Java 2 
Enterprise Edition (J2EE) component framework. 

3. Identified and defined a component infiastracture design and analysis lifecycle model called the 
Component-Container-Connector (or CCC). 

The ComponentFirst methodology is a subset of the CCC methodology, as the ComponentFirst 
methodology specifies the process and practice of transforming legacy assets into Connectors. 


2. Research, Design, Develop Data Fusion Component Factory 

ComponentFactory was developed to prototype level. During this period of work the Component Factory 
research, design and development has split into three major sub-efforts: 

1. Research, design and development of the reverse engineering and extraction of legacy object 
model. 

2. Research, design and development of the high quality of service toolkit for transforming legacy 
assets independent of object model. 

3. Research, design and development integrating semantically-rich two or more legacy asset 
interfaces into a federated object model. 


3. Research, design and development of the reverse engineering and extraction of legacy object model. 
Research and design was accomplished for extracting legacy interfaces using OOA/OOD tools such as 
Rational Rose and UML 1.3.

4. Research, design and development of the high quality of service toolkit for transforming legacy assets 
independent of object model 

Research and design was accomplished with the ComponentFactoiy tool in the following areas: 

1. Ability to incorporate of the high quality of service facilities, such as load balancing, failover, and 
high performance data streaming as “inffastmcture features” independent of encapsulating and 
mapping legacy assets to target object models 

2. Ability to integrate semantically-rich legacy objects models by exchanging object model interface 
specifications explicitly as metadata using XML as the representation. 

3. Research, design and development of the reverse engineering and extraction of legacy object 
model toolkit for ComponentFactory. 

4. Research, design and development of the high performance (QoS) legacy adapter toolkit for 
ComponentFactoiy. 

5. Research, design and development of the rapid development of semantically-rich federated object 
model integrations for ComponentFactory.
