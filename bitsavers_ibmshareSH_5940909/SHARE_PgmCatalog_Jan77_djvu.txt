SHARE INC. 

The principal purpose of SHARE Inc. is to foster the development, free 
exchange, and public dissemination of research data pertaining to SHARE 
computers in the best scientific tradition. To achieve these ends, SHARE 
conducts meetings, discussion groups, forums, panels, lectures, and other 
similar programs concerned with the development and exchange of research 
and technological data. SHARE publishes the results of its scientific re- 
search through its SHARE Secretary's Distribution (SSD) and other publica- 
tions and makes such publications available to the interested public on a 
noncommittal and non-discriminatory basis. SHARE attempts to establish 
and continually improve standards for communicating computer scientific 
research and programming information to interested members of the public. 
All inquiries and requests to SHARE, other than for programs and their 
associated documentation elements, should be directed to:

The SHARE Program Library Agency 

The SHARE Program Library is a collection of generally useful programs 
created and administered to promote the exchange of technical information, 
to lower software development costs, and to help avoid redundant effort. 
Programs and their documentation are made available to all at distribution 
costs. The SHARE Program Library Agency (SPLA) is operated on a non-profit 
basis by the Triangle Universities Computation Center (TUCC) for SHARE Inc. 

TUCC serves as the distribution agent for contributed programs and does not 
test or maintain the programs. Programs and documentation are distributed 
in the original form as submitted by the author. Neither TUCC nor SHARE 
Inc. makes any warranty, expressed or implied, as to the documentation, 
function, or performance of contributed programs . 



HOW TO ORDER FROM SPLA 

General Procedures 

SHARE membership is not required to order programs from the Library. The 
price for programs is the same for both SHARE members and non-SHARE members. 

All orders should be accompanied by either a purchase order or payment. 

When ordering from SPLA, please send all materials relevant to an order (e.g., 
purchase orders, checks, order forms, etc.) in the same envelope. This is 
necessary to prevent duplication of orders. 

A $5.00 handling fee is charged on all orders that are not prepaid. 

All orders from outside the North American Continent must be prepaid. 

All shipments will be sent via airmail (first class for U.S.A.), postpaid. 

Telephone orders cannot be accepted. 

All orders should be written on a SPLA order form (contained in this catalog) 
and sent to the following address: 

SHARE Program Library Agency 

Triangle Universities Computation Center 

Post Office Box 12076 

Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 

Telephone: (919) 549-0671 (ext. 283) 

Program Orders 

The standard distribution includes one copy of all machine-readable material 
and one copy of the documentation (some documentation is in machine-readable 
form only). 

Only programs in the 360D, 370D, 360E or 1130 series, as indexed in this cata- 
log, are currently shipped by SPLA. 

The price of a standard distribution is $35.00 per program for orders from 
the North American Continent, and $40.00 per program for all others. Other 
applicable charges are listed below: 

• The number of pages of documentation is listed at the bottom 
of each program abstract. An additional charge of $ .05 per 
page is made for each page over 20 pages. 

• Machine-readable material is available on 9-track 800 or 1600 
bpi tapes. Do not send tapes; SPLA will provide all required 
materials as part of the distribution. 



ii 



Some programs require a tape longer than 600'; this is 
noted at the bottom of the program abstract. There is 
an additional charge of $5.00 per 600' (tapes are avail- 
able in 600', 1200', and 2400' only). 

Punched cards may be requested for programs for which the 
number of cards does not exceed 1,000; a tape will be 
substituted for any program requiring more than 1,000 cards 
(except by special arrangement). Some programs include 
files which are not suitable to punched card distribution, 
e.g., print files. The availability of punched cards is 
noted at the bottom of each abstract. 



Documentation Only Orders 

Documentation can be ordered at a cost of $5.00 per document plus $ .05 per 
page for all pages over the first 20. 

Some documentation is in machine-readable form only and is unavailable as 
"documentation only". 

Documentation availability and a page count are given at the bottom of each 
program abstract. 

SHARE Catalog Orders 

Copies of the SHARE Program Library User's Guide and Catalog of Programs are 
available through SPLA at a cost of $10.00. Catalogs ordered from SPLA in- 
clude 4 update mailings on a calendar year basis. If an update has been 
mailed prior to a catalog order, the update will be shipped with the catalog

SUBMITTAL OF PROGRAMS TO THE SHARE LIBRARY 



Submittal of programs is no longer restricted to SHARE member installations 
provided that certain standards are met. The Library endeavors to distribute 
well -documented useful programs. For this reason, certain items must be in- 
cluded with each submittal. A complete program package includes: 

• Completed and signed SHARE Library Submittal Form; 

• Acknowledgement of Assistance Statement; 

• Program Documentation (machine-readable preferred); 

• Source Program; 

• Sample Problem(s). 

At the author's discretion, the following items may also be submitted: 

• Object program - specify system release and type; 

• Flowcharts. 

The above items will be discussed in greater detail in the following sections. 
Questions, comments, or suggestions concerning these requirements or the SHARE 
Program Library at TUCC may be addressed to the SHARE Program Library Project 
Manager as listed in Section 1.0 of the SHARE Reference Manual. 

Completed submittal packages should be mailed to SPLA at the following address 

SHARE Program Library Agency 

Triangle Universities Computation Center 

Post Office Box 12076 

Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 

The availability of these programs is announced via the SHARE Program Library 
User's Guide and Catalog, published as a special edition of the SSD. Periodic 
supplements and announcements will be included in the back of the regular SSDs 
These supplements are also sent to purchasers of the SHARE Catalog. 



SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS 

Program Submittal Form 

Each program submitted must include a completed and signed SHARE Program Library 
Submittal Form. Blank forms with instructions for completion are available from 
the Library. A copy of this form is shown at the end of this section. 

The program submittal form is reproduced as part of the distributed program pack- 
age. 



VI 



Acknowledgement of Assistance Statement 

Each submittal must include, in letter form on a separate sheet, signed and 
dated, the following statement: 

To the best of my knowledge, my program entitled 



is free of any proprietary, secret, or confidential information belonging to 
any person or organization. (Continue with a. or b. below.) 

a. Where I have used the work, plans, procedures, systems, programs 
or names of companies or individuals, I have obtained their per- 
mission to do so. 

b. I have not used the work, plans, procedures, systems, programs or 
names of any companies or individuals. 

This statement is not reproduced as part of the distributed program package. 

Documentation 

All documentation supporting a contributed program is reproduced for distribu- 
tion (machine-readable documentation is preferred). 

For non-machine-readable documentation, the following graphic guidelines should 
be observed: 

• Submit clean copy (originals if possible). 

• Use 8% x 11 white paper, typed ON ONE SIDE ONLY, for text material. 

• Pasteovers are preferred to the opaque method for correcting typographical 
errors. 

• Provide adequate margins for all documents -- about one inch on all sides. 

• Machine generated documents should use six lines to the inch spacing and 
not be larger than 8% x 11 inches; a new ribbon should be used with unlined 
white paper; extra comments may be typed or handwritten in black ink. 

• Illustrations, hand-drawn flow-charts, and layout forms should be drawn 
in black ink on sheets 8h x 11 inches. 

• Each page of documentation should be sequentially numbered. 

The documentation should cover the items from the following list plus any other 
information helpful to users of the program: 

• Purpose -- a concise description of the task that the program is designed 
to accomplish. 

• Functional and mathematical methods -- briefly describe and state why the 
particular method was selected. 



vn 



• Limitations -- range, accuracy, floating or fixed numbers, restric- 
tions and dependencies on other programs. 

• Environment requirements. 

• Input/Output -- description and layouts. 

• Instructions on how to use the program (control cards, data structure, 
etc. ). 

• Statement indicating the amount of testing and how the program has 
been used prior to submission. Include a description of the test data. 

• Table of Contents (helpful in long documentation and User's Manuals). 

Program 

Program submittals are accepted in magnetic tape form only. 

Tape Key 

A tape key is required and should list the title and description of each file, 
followed by the data record length, blocking factor, and block length. Specify 
the mode of each file, e.g., Binary EBCDIC, etc. If relevant, indicate the 
standard IBM utility program which can be used to punch a deck or print a list- 
ing. Also specify the control card information for the utility program. 

Please specify the exact number of tape marks on the tape. When reproducing 
the tape for distribution, SPLA utilizes the tape mark count in controlling the 
amount of data to be copied. 

EXAMPLE: Tape Key 

This volume contains 3 Files and 3 Tape Marks arranged as follows: 

File 1 Assembled Object Deck 
EBCDIC 

Sequence 0001 through 0200 in cols. 77-80; 
PRG in cols. 73-75; 200 cards 
200 card images blocked 20 per block 
10 blocks of 1600 characters each 
T/M 

File 2 Sample Data Input 
EBCDIC 

SMPL in cols 77-80; 160 cards 
8 blocks of 1600 characters each 
T/M 



vm 



File 3 Program Source Deck 

Sequence 0001 through 1160 in cols. 77-80; 

SPRG in cols. 73-76; 1160 cards 

1160 card images blocked 20 per block 

58 blocks of 1600 characters each 

T/M 

NOTE: The tape key portion of the program documentation should not specify 
recording track and density since these options may be specified by persons 
ordering programs from SPLA. However, the original submittal tape should be 
labeled with this information. 



Sample Problem 

A sample problem is defined for purposes of these standards as a set of test 
inputs to the program and the corresponding output from the program. Listings 
of the sample input and output data should be included when meaningful. 

Program Package Revisions 

The submittal of program revisions must always be accompanied by a new SHARE 
Program Library Submittal Form and identified as a REVISION in Item 8 of that 
submittal form. A completely new program package must be submitted.

COMPRESSED SOURCE LIBRARY SYSTEM 

AUTHOR: P. MICHAEL HENDERSON 

DIRECT TECHNICAL INQUIRIES TO: 
P. MICHAEL HENDERSON 
MIDDLE SOUTH SERVICES 
200 WEST BANK EXPRESSWAY 
GRETNA, LOUISIANA 70053 

DESCRIPTION - THE COMPRESSED SOURCE LIBRARY SYSTEM ALLOWS A 
USER TO EASILY ADD, REPLACE OR CHANGE AND OPTIONALLY 
COMPILE/ASSEMBLE SOURCE CODE ON A DIRECT ACCESS COMPRESSED 
LIBRARY. IN ADDITION, A TRANSPORTABLE COPY OF THE SOURCE 
CODE IN UNCOMPRESSED EBCDIC FORM MAY ALSO BE PRODUCED. THE 
SYSTEM HAS PROVED TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE COMPRESSION FACTORS 
OF ABOUT 3/1 FOR MOST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES. THE SYSTEM WAS 
WRITTEN FOR AND TESTED ON AN IBM 370 MACHINE USING OS/360 
MVT RELEASE 20.6 AND 21.6. THERE APPEARS TO BE NO REASON 
WHY THE SYSTEM WILL NOT OPERATE UNDER MFT OR VS1 BUT IT HAS 
NOT BEEN SUBMITTED TO ANY FORMAL TESTING ON EITHER SYSTEM, 
HOWEVER, THE SYSTEM AS WRITTEN WILL NOT OPERATE ON A 360 
MACHINE DUE TO THE USE OF 370 INSTRUCTIONS. THE 370 
INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT IRREPLACABLE AND THE SYSTEM COULD BE 
CONVERTED TO OPERATE ON A 360 MACHINE BY A USER INSTALLATION 
IF DESIRED. 

THE COMPRESSED SOURCE LIBRARY SYSTEM IS WRITTEN IN IBM 
OS/360 ASSEMBLER F AND REQUIRES THE IBM PROGRAMS IEBUPDTE, 
IEBCOPY, AND IEHMOVE TO GENERATE AND OPERATE THE SYSTEM. 

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE - OS/360 ASSEMBLER F

IBM S/360 MODEL 20 MULTIUTILITY PROGRAM 

AUTHOR: R. KOLAR 

DIRECT TECHNICAL INQUIRIES TO: 

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE 
CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE 



DESCRIPTION - THE S/360 MULTIUTILITY PROGRAM IS A CORE- 
RESIDENT PROGRAM DESIGNED TO PERFORM THE FOLLOWING 
FUNCTIONS: LISTING, REPRODUCING, INTERPRETING, TRANSLATING, 
DECK SEQUENCING, AND MAILING LABEL PRODUCTION. ADDITIONAL 
LISTING OPTIONS INCLUDE - SINGIE SPACE (EDCDIC) , DOUBLE 
SPACE (EBCDIC), SINGLE SPACE (BCD), SINGLE SPACE 
(HEXADECIMAL) . THE DECK SEQUENCING PROGRAM IS NOT 
RESTRICTED TO THE TRADITIONAL FORMAT OF A 3 CHARACTER 
IDENTIFICATION FIELD AND A 5 DIGIT SEQUENCE NUMBER. THROUGH 
THE USE OF A CONTROL CARD, THE USER MAY SPECIFY THE 
IDENTIFICATION FIELD CONSTANT, THE STARTING VALUE FOR 
THE SEQUENCE NUMBERS, AND THE INCREMENT FOR THE SEQUENCE 
NUMBERS, THE ONLY RESTRICTION IS THAT THE IDENTIFICATION 
FIELD CONSTANT MUST BE AT LEAST 1 CHARACTER. A RESEQUENCING 
FACILITY IS ALSO PROVIDED. THE MAILING LABEL PROGRAM IS 
INDEPENDENT OF LABEL SIZE SINCE IT REQUIRES NO SPECIAL 
CARRIAGE TAPE. A CONTROL CARD IS USED TO SPECIFY THE IABEL 
SIZE, THE NAME FIELD, THE ADDRESS FIELD, AND THE CHARACTER 
WHICH IS USED AS A DELIMITER WITHIN THE ADDRESS FIELD. 
HENCE THE PROGRAM IS NOT RESTRICTED TO PROCESSING ADDRESS 
CARDS OF A PARTICULAR FORMAT. RESTRICTIONS ARE THAT ALL 
INFORMATION PERTAINING TO AN ADDRESS MUST BE PUNCHED ON 
A SINGLE CARD AND THE ADDRESS BAY NOT EXCEED U LINES. 

ONCE THE PROGRAM IS LOADED, SEVERAL UTILITY FUNCTIONS CAN 
BE PERFORMED CONSEQUETIVELY BY INTERROGATING THE DATA 
SWITCHES ON THE CONSOLE. ANY OF THE FUNCTIONS - SINGLE 
SPACE (EBCDIC LIST), REPRODUCE, AND INTERPRET MAY BE 
PERFORMED SIMULTANEOUSLY ON A SINGLE PASS. THE PROGRAM 
USES A CARD SCANNING ALGORITHM TO DETERMINE THE DATA CONTENT 
OF EACH SOURCE CARD SO THAT THE REPRODUCING AND INTERPRETING 
FUNCTIONS ARE PERFORMED WITH A HIGHER DEGREE OF EFFICIENCY. 

PROGRAMMING SYSTEMS - WRITTEN IN BASIC ASSEMBLER LANGUAGE. 

MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS - 2020 CPU (4K) , 2203 PRINTER 
(120 PRINT POSITIONS) , 2560 MCFM (WITH INTERPRETING

VARIABLE LENGTH RECORD DELETION SUBROUTINE, VBDMDLET 



AUTHOR: 



MARK WITTE 



DIRECT TECHNICAL INQUIRIES TO: 
DOUGLAS KUNKEL 
LIBRARY SYSTEMS 
WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY 
PULLMAN, WA 99163 

DESCRIPTION - FOR INSTALLATIONS USING IBM COMPATIELE DIRECT 
ACCESS STORAGE DEVICES (DASD) AND THE EASIC DIRECT ACCESS 
METHOD (BDAM), USERS OF VOLATILE FILES WITH KEYED, VARIABLE 
LENGTH RECORDS ARE FACED WITH THE PROBLEM OF WASTED STORAGE 
SPACE CAUSED BY •LOGICAL' RECORD DELETION, WHICH EVENTUALLY 
REQUIRES EXPENSIVE FILE REORGANIZATION. 

PASSED THE RECORD ADDRESS (MBBCCHHR OR TTR) OF A RECORD TO 
BE DELETED, VBDMDLET WILL PHYSICALLY DELETE THE RECORD IN 
TWO (2) I/O COUNTS, REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF RECORDS ON 
THE TRACK OR THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THE RECORD TO BE 
DELETED. 

WRITTEN IN IBM 360 ASSEMBLER AND IMPLEMENTED FOR THE 2314 
DASD ON AN IBM 360/67 WITH OS/MVT, THE ROUTINE IS DESIGNED 
TO BE DEVICE DEPENDENT AND MINIMIZE CORE USAGE. THUS 
DYNAMIC BUFFER ALLOCATION IS EMPLOYEE. THE ROUTINE REQUIRES 
LESS THAN 2K OF CORE STORAGE, AND SINCE IT IS REENTRANT, IT 
IS SUITABLE FOR EITHER ON-LINE OR EATCH MODE APPLICATION. 

VBDMDLET OFFERS THE USER CONSIDERABLE SAVINGS OVER FILE 
REORGANIZATION COSTS SINCE ONIY TWO I/O COUNTS ARE REQUIRED 
PER RECORD DELETED, AS OPPOSED TO FOUR I/O COUNTS FOR EACH 
RECORD RETAINED DURING REORGANIZATION.

ONE-WAY ENCIPHERING ALGORITHM FOR PASSWORD PROTECTION 

AUTHOR: H. D. KNOBLE 

DIRECT TECHNICAL INQUIRIES TO: 
H. D. KNOBLE 
214 COMPUTER BUILDING 
THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY 
UNIVERSITY PARK, PA 16802 

DESCRIPTION - SUBROUTINE PURDY IS A RE-ENTERAELE SYSTEM 
UTILITY PROGRAM WHICH EVALUATES A FAMILY OF MATHEMATICALLY 
SOUND, ONE-WAY ENCIPHERING FUNCTIONS WITH KNOWN PROPERTIES. 
THE ALGORITHM IS IMPLEMENTED HERE TO ENABLE 8-CHARACTER 
PASSWORDS TO BE IRREVERSIBLY ENCIPHERED FOR SECURITY 
APPLICATIONS (COMPUTER RESOURCE AUTHORIZATIONS). UNLIKE 
MANY EXISTING METHODS USED FOR SEVERAL CURRENT OPERATING 
SYSTEM SECURITY APPLICATIONS (E.G. MVS PASSWORDS) , THIS 
METHOD DOES NOT RELY ON KEEPING THE ALGORITHM OR LIST OF 
ENCIPHERED KEYS SECRET; THIS IS TRUE BECAUSE NO KNOWN 
ALGORITHM EXISTS TO INVERT THE ENCIPHERING FUNCTION, AND 
IF ONE WERE DISCOVERED, DECIPHERING A KEY WOULD STILL 
REQUIRE, ON THE AVERAGE, MANY YEARS OF CPU TIME ON MODERN, 
HIGH-SPEED EQUIPMENT. BECAUSE THE FAMILY ENCIPHERING 
FUNCTIONS UPON WHICH THIS ROUTINE IS BASED HAS ESSENTIALLY 
AN INFINITE NUMBER OF PARAMETERIZATIONS, THIS I IMPLEMENTATION 
ALLOWS COMPUTER RESOURCE AUTHORIZATION TO BE INDEPENDENT 
AND UNIQUE ACROSS APPLICATIONS.

DESCRIPTION - THIS IS A SECOND REVISION OF A PROBLEM 
ORIENTED LANGUAGE FOR CONTINUOUS SIMULATION OF THE KINETICS 
OF CHEMICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMS. IT TRANSLATES 
CHEMICAL REACTIONS INTO DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS, SOLVES THEM 
BY NUMERICAL METHODS STARTING FROM SPECIFIED INITIAL 
CONDITIONS, AND EDITS THE RESULTS. THE STIFF DIFFERENTIAL 
EQUATION SOLVING METHOD OF GEAR IS INCLUDED WITH 
MODIFICATIONS (ROMAN ET AL., PROC. NCC, 1976, P. 793) TO 
SPEED THE SOLUTION AND DECREASE THE CORE MEMORY REQUIREMENT 
FOR LARGE PROBLEMS. THE PROGRAM AS SUBMITTED IS BATCH- 
PROCESSOR AND CARD-INPUT ORIENTED, IS WRITTEN IN FORTRAN 
AND HAS BEEN "STRUCTURED" FOR EASE OF PROGRAMMER 
INTERVENTION. IT SHOULD RUN ON ANY LARGE BATCH-PROCESSING 
MACHINE WITH FORTRAN LEVEL G OR ABOVE. A DESCRIPTION OF THE 
ORIGINAL VERSION HAS BEEN PUBLISHED (COMPUTERS AND 
BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH, 2 31, 1968) ; A REVISED DESCRIPTION WILL 
BE SUBMITTED SOON.

DIRECT TECHNICAL INQUIRIES TO: 

PROFESSOR W. M. MCKEEMAN

DESCRIPTION - THE XPL SYSTEM IS A COMPLETE COMPILER 
GENERATOR, DESIGNED TO FACILITATE THE PRODUCTION OF 
EFFICIENT SYNTAX-DIRECTED COMPILERS FOR THE S/360. THE 
SYSTEM CONSISTS OF A DIALECT OF PL/I CALLED XPL DESIGNED TO 
BE CONVENIENT FOR WRITING TRANSLATORS: A COMPILER (XCOM) 
FROM XPL INTO S/360 MACHINE LANGUAGE; A SMALL OS/360 
ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE SUB-MONITOR WHICH PROVIDES THE INTERFACE 
BETWEEN XPL PROGRAMS AND OS/360; A PROGRAM (ANALYZER) WHICH 
BUILDS PARSING DECISION TABLES DIRECTLY FROM ENF GRAMMARS; 
AND A TABLE DRIVEN PARSING ALGORITHM EMBEDDED IN A PROTO- 
COMPILER (SKELETON) ; AND SEVERAL UTILITY PROGRAMS TO AID IN 
USING THE SYSTEM UNDER OS/360. THE XPL SYSTEM WAS DEVELOPED 
TO RUN UNDER OS/360 RELEASE 20 MFT II. IT WILL RUN UNDER 
OS/360 ON ANY S/360 WITH THE UNIVERSAL INSTRUCTION SET, 
DIRECT ACCESS STORAGE (2311, 2314, OR 2321), AND AT LEAST 
128K BYTES OF STORAGE (ALTHOUGH MORE STORAGE ENHANCES SYSTEM 
PERFORMANCE). THE SYSTEM AS DISTRIBUTED ASSUMES 2311 DISKS 
AND WILL RUN UNCHANGED ON 2314 DISKS. PROGRAMS AND 
INSTRUCTIONS ARE PROVIDED FOR ADAPTING THE SYSTEM TO WORK 
WITH OTHER 2311 DISKS. ALL MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE SYSTEM 
EXCEPT A SMALL ASSEMBLY-LANGUAGE SUBMONITOR ARE WRITTEN AND 
COMPILED BY XCOM. THE SYSTEM MAY EE ADAPTED TO RUN UNDER 
OPERATING SYSTEMS OTHER THAN OS/360 BY WRITING A NEW VERSION 
OF THE SUBMONITOR. SINCE XCOM WAS WRITTEN IN XPL ITS 
PERFORMANCE (3500-6000 CARDS/MINUTE COMPILATION RATE UNDER 
HASP ON A 360/65) IS TYPICAL OF COMPILERS PRODUCED BY THE ' 
XPL SYSTEM. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION IS CONTAINED IN THE "THE 
XPL COMPILER GENERATOR SYSTEM" BY MCKEEMAN ET AL, 
PROCEEDINGS OF THE 1968 FALL JOINT COMPUTER CONFERENCE. 
FULL DOCUMENTATION IS GIVEN BY 'A COMPILER GENERATOR' BY 
MCKEEMAN, HORNING, AND WORTMAN (PRENTICE HALL, NOVEMBER 
1970). THE SYSTEM HAS DEVELOPED AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND 
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT SANTA CRUZ. IT HAS BEEN 
IN USE AT STANFORD SINCE 1967 AND AT OTHER INSTALLATIONS 
SINCE NOVEMBER 1967.

ECTIVE CATALOGS, 
TO USERS OF IBM 



THE PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT IS TO DESCBIEE THAT PART OF THE 
SYSTEM WHICH IS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF PROGRAM CATALOGS 
AND THEIR RELATE! INDICES. THE PROGRAMS INVOLVED ARE 
DESIGNED TO ACCEPT INPUT TO DATA FILES, TO PROCESS CHANGE 
TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING DATA IN THE FILES, TO EXTRACT EATA 
FROM THE FILES ACCORDING TO SPECIFIED KEYS, AND TO PRINT 
FORMATTED INDICES AND ABSTRACT LISTINGS. FROM DATA STORED 
IN THE SYSTEM, THE CATALOG PROCESSOR WILL PRODUCE A CATALOG 
AND A VARIETY OF INDICES. IN DEVELOPING THE PROGRAM, EVERY 
EFFORT WAS MADE TO ALLOW AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIELE IN 
ARRANGING DATA AND FORMATTING PRINT-OUTS. PROVISIONS ARE 
MADE TO SELECT PARTICULAR SETS OF RECORDS FROM THE TOTAL 
FILE, AND TO SEGMENT THE VARIOUS LISTINGS AND INDICES 
ACCORDING TO TYPES OF PROGRAM OR OTHER CONTROLS. FORMATS OF 
LISTINGS AS TO LINE LENGTH, SPACING, HEADINGS, ETC., CAN 
GENERALLY BE SPECIFIED BY THE USER THROUGH CONTROL CARDS 
ENTERED AT THE TIME OF EXECUTION OF A PARTICULAR PROGRAM. 
A GENERALIZED OVERVIEW OF THE SYSTEM SHOWS TWO EASIC 
OPERATING PHASES: THE FIRST UPDATES AND MAINTAINS THE FILE, 
THE SECOND IS THE TEXT WRITING PHASE. 

EACH PHASE CONSISTS OF SEVERAL PROGRAMS WHICH MANIPULATE THE 
INFORMATION STORED IN THE INTEGRAL DATA BASE. THE WORD 
INTEGRAL IS USED TO EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT IT IS A SINGLE 
DATA BASE, EVEN THOUGH IT IS SEGMENTED INTO FOUR MAJOR 
CATEGORIES AND MAY PHYSICALLY BESIDE IN ONE OR MORE VOLUMES 
OR DATA SETS. THE FOUR CATEGORIES ARE AS FOLLOWS (A)

SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94143 

DESCRIPTION - THIS PACKAGE PROVIDES A REPORT WRITER FACILITY 
IN PL/I, SIMILAR TO THAT IN COBOL. THE PACKAGE USES PL/I 
COMPILE TIME FACILITIES TO TRANSLATE THE SPECIAL 
CONSTRUCTIONS INTO GOTOS, CALLS, LABELS, AND PROCEDURES. 
NORMAL USE INVOLVES TWO % INCLUDE STATEMENTS REFERRING 
TO AN ON-LINE LIBRARY CONTAINING THE TWO SECTIONS OF CODE, 
LABELED REP1 AND REP2. 



IT IS NATURAL, PARTICULARLY AT MIT, THAT COMPUTER SOFTWARE 
SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS OF DOCUMENT PRODUCTION SHOULD BE 
DEVISED. CTSS'S "RUNOFF", HUITICS'S "RUNOFF", CMS'S 
"SCRIPT" REPRESENT SIMILAR SUCH SOLUTIONS. 

"NSCRIPT" IS AN OUTGROWTH OF SCRIPT INTENDED FOR USE UNDER 
CMS ON A SYSTEM/360 MODEL 67 RUNNING UNDER CP/67. IT«S SET 
OF COMMAND WORDS ENCOMEASSES BCST OF THOSE EELONGING TO 
SCRIPT, MULTICS'S "RUNOFF", AND TSO'S FORMAT. IN MOST CASES 
THEY PERFORM IDENTICAL FUNCTIONS AND HAVE THE SAME SYMEOLIC 
NOTATION. 

NSCRIPT RUNNING UNDER 360/OS/TSO, WHICH WAS DEVELOPED BY THE 
MIT PROGRAMMING DEVELOPMENT OFFICE, HAS THE SAME OUTWARD 
APPEARANCE AS IT DID WHEN RUNNING UNDER CMS. EXCEPT FOR THE 
FACT THAT OS I/O CONVENTIONS MAKE IT SOMEWHAT MORE DIFFICULT 
TO USE, IT STILL HAS ALL THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT HAD WITH 
CMS. 

SEVERAL POWERFUL FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE WITH NSCRIPT THAT 
ARE NOT AVAILABLE WITH TSO'S FORMAT:

2- THE ABILITY TO USE SYMBOLIC "REFERENCE NAMES" TO 
SIMPLIFY NUMBERING AND CROSS-REFERENCING. 

3- THE ABILITY TO DEFINE BOTH HEADING AND FOOTING LINES FOR

BOTH EVEN AND ODD NUMBERED PAGES. 

4- THE ABILITY TO SPECIFY FORMAT CONTROL INFORMATION OR 
TEXT DYNAMICALLY (DURING PRINTOUT) . 

5- THE ABILITY TO USE ROMAN NUMERALS (INSTEAD OF ARABIC) IN 
PAGE NUMBERS AND, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE HEADING AND 
FOOTING CONTROLS, TO PLACE PAGE NUMBERS IN A VARIETY OF 
PLACES ON THE OUTPUT PAGE. 

6- THE ABILITY TO SPECIFY TRANSLATION TABLE PAIRS. 

7- THE ABILITY TO DEFINE "REMOTE SEQUENCES", WHICH ARE 
INVOKED AT SPECIFIED PLACES IN THE OUTPUT. 

8- THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE OUTPUT CONDITIONALLY. 

NSCRIPT CONSISTS OF 2 MODULES, A COMMAND PROCESSOR 
(PROMPTER) FOR USE WITH TSO, AND A PROGRAM FOR PROCESSING 
NSCRIPT FILES WHICH CAN BE INVOKED EITHER BY THE TSO 
PROMPTER OR BY A BATCH JOB. 

SINCE NSCRIPT CAN TREAT TAB CHARACTERS INTERNALLY, SEVERAL 
(OPTIONAL) MODIFICATIONS TO THE TSO EDITOR FOR TAB 
PROCESSING ARE INCLUDED. THE MODIFICATIONS INCLUDE THE 
ADDITION OF A SCRIPT FILE TYPE WHICH IS SIMILAR TO A TEXT 
FILE TYPE EXCEPT FOR LINE LENGTH AND TAB PROCESSING.

DESCRIPTION - FORTXREF IS A STANDARD PL/I PROGRAM USING 
SYSIN FOR THE INPUT DATA AND SYSPRINT FOE THE OUTPUT. 
THE DATA CONSISTS OF ONE OR MORE FORTRAN PROGRAMS. EACH 
OCCURRENCE OF A FORTRAN END CARD WILL CAUSE THE CROSS- 
REFERENCING TABLE TO BE OUTPUT AND REINITIALIZED. THIS 
WILL ALSO HAPPEN ON END OF DATA IF THE LAST CARD IS NOT 
AN END CARD. EACH INPUT CARD WILL BE OUTPUT WITH A FORTRAN 
LINE NUMBER IF APPROPRIATE. THE CROSS-REFERENCE TABLE 
GIVES (IN 360 COLLATING SEQUENCE) EACH KEYWORD, VARIABLE 
NAME, STATEMENT NUMBER, AND CCKSTANT WITH A LIST OF EACH 
USE BY LINE NUMBER. INACCURACIES- IF "FORMAT" IS USED

AUTHORS: K. CONROW 



R.G. SMITH 



DIRECT TECHNICAL INQUIRIES TO: 
KENNETH CONROW 
COMPUTING CENTER 
KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY 
MANHATTAN, KANSAS 665C2 

DESCRIPTION - THE PROGRAM (NEATER) ACCEPTS A SYNTACTICALLY 
CORRECT PL/I PROGRAM AND OPERATES ON IT TO PRODUCE A 
REFORMATTED VERSION. IT EITHER PRINTS OB PRINTS AND PUNCHES 
THE REFORMATTED PROGRAM IN A LOGICAL OR IN A COMPRESSED 
FORMAT. IT NEATENS THE STATEMENTS BY OMITTING NONESSENTIAL 
STRINGS OF BLANKS. LOGICAL STRUCTURE IS INDICATED BY 
INDENTATION; THE AMOUNT OF INDENTATION FOR EACH LOGICAL 
LEVEL IS CONTROLLED BY THE USER. STATEMENT NUMBERS ARE 
PRODUCED WHICH CORRESPOND TO THOSE PRODUCED BY THE COMPILER. 
THE PROGRAM IS EXTREMELY USEFUL IN DEVELOPMENT OF 
COMPLICATED PL/I SOURCE PROGRAMS BECAUSE AN UNEXPECTED 
INDENTATION PATTERN WILL AT ONCE REVEAL LOGIC ERRORS. 
LOGICALLY FORMATTED VERSIONS OF COMPLICATED SOURCE PROGRAMS 
ARE FAR MORE VALUABLE IN DOCUMENTATION OF SUCH PROGRAMS 
THAN AN UNFORMATTED SOURCE LISTING. 

PROGRAMMING SYSTEMS - NEATER IS WRITTEN IN PL/I, IT OPERATES 
SUCCESSFULLY ON ITSELF, THE SUBMITTED DECK IS IN COMPRESSED 
FORMAT, THE SUBMITTED LISTING IS IN LOGICAL FORMAT WITH 
THE DEFAULT INDENTATION OF 3 AND SERVES AS AN EXAMPLE OF 
NEATER' S OUTPUT. NEATER HAS BEEN COMPILED AND TESTED USING 
OS VERSION 17 ON A S360 MODEL 50.

DECTALB, A DECISION TABLE TRANSLATOR BASED ON LIST

AUTHOR: KENNETH CONROW (WITH RONALD G. SMITH) 

DIRECT TECHNICAL INQUIRIES TO: 
KENNETH CONROW 
COMPUTING CENTER 
KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY 
MANHATTAN, KANSAS 66502 

DESCRIPTION - DECTALB, A DECISION TABLE ALGORITHM BASED ON 
LIST PROCESSING TECHNIQUES, IS A TRANSLATOR WHICH CONVERTS 
PROGRAMS OR PROGRAM SEGMENTS WRITTEN IN DECISION TABLES 
INTO COMPILABLE PL/I CODING. THE USE OF A DIRECTORY VECTOR 
TO CONTROL EXECUTION ENABLES COMPLETE ELIMINATION OF 
DUPLICATE CODING OF STUBS, COMPLETE FREEDOM OF REUSE OF 
STUBS THROUGHOUT A DECTALB BLCCK, AND AUTOMATIC 
REARRANGEMENT OF CONDITION STUBS TO REDUCE THE OVERHEAD OF 
RULE SELECTION. THE EXECUTION TIME CONTROL SECTION IS SO 
SIMPLE THAT IT ADDS VERY LITTLE OVERHEAD AT EXECUTION TIME. 
THE VERSION SUBMITTED IS THE BOOTSTRAP WHICH WAS EMPLOYED 
TO IMPLEMENT A MORE COMPLETE SKSTEM. THE EOOTSTRAP 
IMPLEMENTS THE BASIC FEATURES MENTIONED ABOVE BUT DOES NOT 
INCORPORATE ELABORATIONS LIKE PROCESSING EXTENDED ENTRY 
DECISION TABLES, PROVISION OF DIAGNOSTICS, AND ACCEPTANCE 
OF CONTROL OPTIONS.

BAYLOR INFORMATION ANALYSIS SYSTEM (EIAS) 

AUTHOR: ALAN BEALE 

DIRECT TECHNICAL INQUIRIES TO: 
ALAN BEALE 

INSTITUTE OF COMPUTER SCIENCE 
BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE 
1200 MOURSUND 
HOUSTON, TEXAS 77025 

DESCRIPTION - BIAS, THE BAYLOR INFORMATION ANALYSIS 
SYSTEM, IS A VERSATILE DATA BASE SYSTEM. IT ALLOWS 
ACCESS TO ANY NUMBER OF DATA BASES, CONTAINING RECORDS 



1. THE BIAS FILER. THIS COMPONENT MAKES ALL 
ADDITIONS, DELETIONS AND UPDATES TC BIAS DATA. 
BECAUSE THIS ACTIVITY IS CONCENTRATED IN ONE 
TASK, VARIOUS SYNCHRONIZATION AND RELIABILITY 
PROBLEMS ARE AVOIDED. 

2. THE BIAS TP PROGRAM. THIS IS A MULTI-USER 
INTERACTIVE PROGRAM TO RETRIEVE, MODIFY, DELETE 
AND ADD INDIVIDUAL DATA RECORDS. 

3. THE BIAS TAELE ASSEMBLER. THIS IS A BATCH 
PROGRAM USED TO DEFINE TC BIAS THE LAYOUT AND 
INDEXING STRUCTURE OF THE RECORDS OF A DATA 
BASE. IT ALSO PROVIDES DATA PASSWORDS AND THE 
DEGREE OF PROTECTION DESIRED. 

4. THE BIAS RETRIEVAL PROGRAM (ECOLRET)* THIS IS AN 
INTERACTIVE PROGRAM ALLOWING A DATA EASE TO BE 
SEARCHED FOR RECORDS THAI SATISFY ONE OR MORE 
PROPERTIES, GATHERING STATISTICS AND FREQUENCY 
COUNTS ON SELECTED ITEMS IN THE PROCESS. THE 
PROPERTIES ARE EXPRESSED IN THE FCBM OF "EOOLEAN 
QUESTIONS", USING AN ALGOL-LIKE LANGUAGE. 

5. VARIOUS UTILITIES, BOTH SYSTEM AND USER. USER 
UTILITIES INCLUDE A LOADER, TC LOAD DATA INTO THE 
SYSTEM, AND AN INTERACTIVE PASSWOFC MODIFICATION 
UTILITY. SYSTEM UTILITIES INCLUDE A FILE RECOVERY 
PROGRAM AND A SYSTEM ACCOUNTING ROUTINE. 

6. ALL FACILITIES OF BIAS ARE AVAILAEIE TO PROGRAMS 
WRITTEN IN PL/I, THROUGH USE OF SEVERAL LIBRARIES 
OF INTERFACE ROUTINES. THESE INCLUDE RECORD 
MODIFICATION AND RETRIEVAL ROUTINES, PASSWORD 
VERIFICATION ROUTINES, AND CCNVERSICN ROUTINES. 

IMPORTANT FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM ARE: 

1. ALL DATA IS STORED IN ONE OS DATA SET, THEREBY 
REDUCING OVERHEAD AND THE NEED TO PROVIDE ROOM 
FOR GROWTH FOR EACH DATA BASE INDEPENDENTLY. 
DATA STORED ON THIS FILE IS GENERALLY STORED IN 
"BLANK-SUPPRESSED" FORM, SO THAT NC SPACE IS 
OCCUPIED BY MISSING DATA. THE FILER IS THE ONLY 
TASK IN THE BIAS SYSTEM THAT CAN USE THE BIAS 
DATA FILE FOR OUTPUT. EVEN THOUGH ALL DATA IS 



PAGE 



45 



CONTINUED FROM PRIOR COLUMN 



CONTINUED FROM PRIOR COLUMN 



STORED IN THE SAME DATA SET, A USER MAY ONLY 
RETRIEVE OR MODIFY DATA FOR WHICH HE PROVIDES 
THE CORRECT PASSWORD. FURTHUR, PASSWORDS MAY BE 
EASILY (AND INTERACTIVELY) CHANGED AT ANY TIME. 

2. A DATA CLASS MAY BE REFINED AFTER CREATION, IF 
APPROPRIATE. THE INDEXING STRUCTURE MAY NOT BE 
CHANGED, BUT DATA ITEMS MAY BE ADDED, REMOVED 
OR CHANGED IN CHARACTERISTICS. THE RECORD SIZE 
MAY ALSO BE INCREASED OR DECREASED. HOWEVER, ANY 
RECORD WHOSE MEANING IS CHANGED BY THIS PROCESS 
SHOULD BE REFILED. 

3. FILE REORGANIZATION IS PERIODICALLY NECESSARY. 
HOWEVER, THE REORGANIZATION PROCESS (CALLED 
"DATASPACE RECLAMATION") IS PERFORMED BY THE FILER, 
AND DOES NOT INHIBIT THE COMPLETE USE OF THE SYSTEM, 
OTHER THAN BY FRACTIONALLY INCREASING RESPONSE TIME. 

4. FILE INTEGRITY IS PRESERVED EVEN IF THE FILER 
ABENDS, OR THE OPERATING SYSTEM CRASHES. 
ADDITIONALLY, THE SYSTEM MAY BE GENERATED TO 
RECORD ALL UPDATE TRANSACTIONS. IF THE FILE IS 
HARMED OR LOST, IT MAY BE RESTORED FROM A BACKUP, 
AND BROUGHT UP TO DATE THROUGH APPLICATION OF THE 
RECORDED TRANSACTIONS, USING A SYSTEM UTILITY. 

SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS OF BIAS ARE: 

1. THE INTERACTIVE PARTS OF BIAS WERE WRITTEN UNDER 

BEST (THE BAYLOR EXECUTIVE SYSTEM FOR TELEPROCESSING), 
WHICH IS IN THE SHARE PROGRAM LIERARY (360D-05. 1 . 01 8) . 
THE SYSTEM IS ADAPTABLE TO OTHER TP SYSTEMS (E.G., 
TSO) , AND SUGGESTIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE 
DOCUMENTATION FOR CONVERSION. 



5. 



THE TP PROGRAM, ARE WRITTEN IN ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE. 
THE PL/I COMPONENTS WERE WRITTEN ECR USE WITH THE 
PL/I OPTIMIZING COMPILER. HOWEVER, THEY WILL COMPILE 
AND RUN USING PL/I (F) . ALSO, THE INTERFACE ROUTINES 
MAY BE GENERATED FOR USE WITH EITHER VERSION OF THE 
PL/I COMPILER. 

NO SPECIAL ACCESS METHODS OR APPENDAGES ARE NEEDED 
FOR BIAS. ALL I/O IS PERFORMED TBROUGH QSAM, BSAM, 
BPAM AND BDAM. 



6. THE AMOUNT OF CORE REQUIBED FOR BIAS DEPENDS ON 

GENERATION PARAMETERS, SUCH AS MAXIMUM RECORD SIZE 
AND MAXIMUM NUMBER OS SIMULTANEOUS USERS. PRACTICAL 
MINIMA ARE 52K EACH FOR THE FILER AND TP PROGRAM AND 
100K FOR BOOLRET. 

ABOUT 350 PAGES OF DOCOMENTATION (MACHINE-READABLE), BOTH 
USER AND SYSTEM, IS PROVIDED WITH BIAS. 

BIAS HAS BEEN RUNNING FOR PRODUCTION AT BAYLOR FOR A YEAR 
AND A HALF. THERE ARE CURRENTLY ABOUT 30 DATA CLASSES IN 
USE, TOTALING 200,000 RECORDS AND 24,000,000 BYTES OF DATA.

2. BIAS RUNS EXCLUSIVELY AS A PROBLEM PROGRAM. IT MAKES 
USE OF ONE USER SVC (TYPE II OR III) FOR INTER-REGION 
COMMUNICATION.

SELECT PROGRAM 



3. BIAS IS CURRENTLY RUNNING UNDER OS/MFT, RELEASE 21.8. 
IT SHOULD RUN WITHOUT CHANGE UNDER MVT, BUT THIS HAS 
NOT BEEN TESTED. BIAS SHOULD ALSO RUN UNDER VS1, 
PROVIDED THE TP INTERFACES WERE CHANGED TO USE A 
VS1-SUPPORTED SYSTEM. IT SHOULD ALSO RUN UNDER VS2 
WITH AN APPROPRIATE TP SYSTEM, IF THE COMMUNICATION 
SVC WERE REWRITTEN.

DESCRIPTION - THE COMMERCIAL FEATURE FOR THE S/360 MODEL 44 
PROVIDES A PROGRAM TO EMULATE THE S/360 INSTRUCTIONS NOT 
IMPLEMENTED IN HARDWARE. THIS PROGRAM REPLACES THE IBM 
LEVEL G EMULATOR. THE NEW EMULATOR, DESIGNATED G1 , HAS BEEN 
WRITTEN TO INCREASE EMULATION SPEED. IT WILL NORMALLY 
PROVIDE AT LEAST A 15% TO 20% REDUCTION IN PROCESSING TIME 
FOR A MAINLINE (NON-44) PROGRAM. THIS AMOUNT VARIES, OF 
COURSE, ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTION MIX (COBOL MAY BE 
FASTER, PL/I NOT SO MUCH, DEPENDING UPON THE ACTUAL CODE 
GENERATED.) THE G1 EMULATOR SUPPORTS STORAGE PROTECTION 
AND ASCII MODE ARITHMETIC AS OPTIONS, ALLOWING A SLIGHT 
IMPROVEMENT IF THESE FEATURES ARE NOT DESIRED. THE PROGRAM 
INCLUDES A CHANNEL LOADER TO BOOTSTRAP IT INTO THE STORAGE 
EXTENSION, AND IS WRITTEN IN ASSEWELY LANGUAGE. 

THE G1 EMULATOR ENTERED TESTING IN SEPTEMBER 1972. SINCE 
THAT DATE, TEST SITES HAVE REPORTED PERFORMANCE GAINS 
RANGING FROM SLIGHTLY UNDER 10% TO OVER 30% ON PARTICULAR 
JOBS. REPORTS OF OVERALL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE UNDER G1 HAVE

LINEAR LEAST-SQUARES CURVE FITTING PROGRAM 

AUTHOR: FRED S. WOOD 

DIRECT TECHNICAL INQUIRIES TO: 
FRED S. WOOD 

STANDARD OIL COMPANY (INDIANA) 
200 E. RANDOLPH DR. 
CHICAGO, IL 60601 



DESCRIPTION - THIS COMPUTER PROGRAM HAS MANY OPTIONS WHICH 
ALLOW THE USER TO TRANSFORM DATA INTO AN APPROPRIATE FORM, 
FIT SPECIFIED EQUATIONS TO THE TRANSFORMED DATA BY LINEAR 
LEAST-SQUARES, AND PROVIDES BOTH STATISTICS AND PLOTS TO AID 
IN EVALUATING THE FIT. A CP-STATISTIC SEARCH TECHNIQUE 
DETERMINES IF SMALLER SETS OF THE VARIABLES WILL REPRESENT 
THE DATA EQUALLY WELL. 

THE TRANSFORMATIONS WHICH ARE AVAILABLE TO THE USER INCLUDE 
RECIPROCALS, SUMS, DIFFERENCE, PRODUCTS, QUOTIENTS, 
LOGARITHMS, AND EXPONENTIALS. SUCH TRANSFORMATIONS ARE USED 
TO CONVERT THE OBSERVED DATA TO MORE CONVENIENT OR MORE 
RATIONAL UNITS, TO ADD TERMS THAT ARE FUNCTIONS OF THE 
DATA-VARIABLES, TO STABILIZE VARIANCE, AND TO OMIT 
VARIABLES. 

IN ADDITION TO THE USUAL STATISTICS, THE PROGRAM CALCULATES 
THE MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM VALUE OF EACH VARIABLE AS WELL AS 
ITS RANGE, THE RELATIVE INFLUENCE OF EACH VARIABLE AND THE 
WEIGHTED SQUARED STANDARDIZED DISTANCE OF EACH OBSERVATION 
FROM THE CENTROID OF ALL OBSERVATIONS. NEAR NEIGHBORS ARE 
USED TO ESTIMATE THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF THE DEPENDENT 
VARIABLE. A TABLE OF COMPONENT EFFECTS SHOWS HOW EACH 
VARIABLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE FITTED VALUE OF EACH 



CONTINUED FROM PRIOR COLUMN 

OBSERVATION. CROSS VERIFICATION OF COEEIICIENTS CAN BE MADE 
WITH A SECOND SAMPLE OF DATA. 

LISTINGS ARE MADE OF THE OBSERVED AND FITTED VALUES OF THE 
DEPENDENT VARIABLE — BOTH IN THE SEQUENCE IN WHICH 
OBSERVATIONS WERE GIVEN TO THE COMPUTER, AND IN THE ORDER 
OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DIFFERENCES BITWEEN THE OBSERVED AND 
FITTED VALUES. PLOTS ARE MADE TO INDICATE (1) WHETHER THESE 
DIFFERENCES ARE NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED AND (2) HOW THEY ARE 
DISTRIBUTED OVER ALL THE FITTED VALUES OF THE DEPENDENT 
VARIABLE. PLOTS OF THESE DIFFERENCES, TOGETHER WITH THE 
COMPONENT EFFECTS OF EACH INDEPENDENT VARIABLE, CAN ALSO BE 
USED (1) TO CHOOSE THE APPROPRIATE FORM OF THE EQUATION, (2) 
TO DETERMINE THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE OBSERVATIONS OVER THE 
RANGE OF EACH INDEPENDENT VARIABLE AND (3) TO ASCERTAIN THE 
INFLUENCE OF EACH OBSERVATION ON EACH COMPONENT OF THE 
EQUATION. 

THE PROGRAM, AS DIMENSIONED, Will HANDLE UP TO 105 VARIABLES 
BEFORE TRANSFORMATIONS, 80 AFTER, AND 1000 OBSERVATIONS. 
PROGRAM CHANGE CARDS ARE INCLUDED TO ALLOW A COMPUTER CENTER 
TO ALSO OFFER A SMALLER PROGBAM WHICH WILL HANDLE UP TO 35 
VARIABLES BEFORE TRANSFORMATIONS, 10 AFTER, AND 200 
OBSERVATIONS. MULTIPLE DEPENDENT VARIAELES ARE FITTED ONE 
AT A TIME AND MUITIPLE FORMS CF SPECIFIED LINEAR EQUATIONS 
CAN BE FITTED WITH ONE DATA LOADING. 

THE MACHINE REQUIREMENTS ARE A FORTRAN IV COMPILER, A CARD 
READER, FOUR SCRATCH FILES AND A PRINTEE. THE CURRENT 
OVERALL DIMENSIONS OF THE 80 VARIAELE PBCGRAM IS 200K, THE 
10 VARIABLE PROGRAM 66K.

AN ADJACENT EFFICIENT EXTREME POINT ALGORITHM FOR VECTOR- 
MAXIMUM AND INTERVAL WEIGHTED-SUMS LINEAR PROGRAMMING 
PROBLEMS 



AUTHOR: 



RALPH E. STEUER 



DIRECT TECHNICAL INQUIRIES TO: 
RALPH E. STEUER 

COLLEGE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS 
UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY 
LEXINGTON, KY 40506 

DESCRIPTION - ADEX IS INTENDED FOR USE IN ANALYZING MULTIPLE 
OBJECTIVE LINEAR PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS. ITS PRIMARY 
ADVANTAGE IS THAT (RATHER THAN GENERATING JUST ONE SOLUTION) 
A LIST OF SEVERAL CANDIDATE SCLUTICNS IS PRODUCED. TBIS IS 
ACCOMPLISHED BY UTILIZING A VECTOR-MAXIMUM REPRESENTATION 
OF LINEAR MULTIPLE OBJECTIVE PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND THEN 
SOLVING FOR ALL EFFICIENT (I.E., PARETO OPTIMAL) EXTREME 
POINTS. 

IN ORDER TO CONTROL THE NUMBER OF EFFICIENT EXTREME POINTS 
GENERATED, ADEX ALLOWS THE SPECIFICATION OF (RATHER THAN 
POINT ESTIMATE WEIGHTS) INTERVAL WEIGHTS FOR EACH OF THE 
DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES. THE LOOSER THE INTERVAL CRITERION 
WEIGHT BOUNDS, THE GREATER THE NUMBER OF EFFICIENT EXTREME 
POINTS GENERATED; THE TIGHTER THE INTERVAL BOUNDS, THE 
FEWER EFFICIENT EXTREME POINTS GENERATED. 

ADEX CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO GCAL PROGRAMMING SITUATIONS 
WHERE COMBINATIONS OF THE DIFFERENT DEVIATION VARIAELES HAVE 
BEEN STRUCTURED AS DISTINCT OBJECTIVES. IN ADDITION, THE 
CODE CAN BE USED TO LOCATE ALI OPTIMAL EXTREME POINTS OF A 
SINGLE OBJECTIVE LINEAR PROGRAM. 

ADEX IS A SELF-CONTAINED PROCEDURE (MAIN PROGRAM AND ALL 
NECESSARY SUBROUTINES) THAT IS WRITTEN IN FORTRAN IV. THE 
ALGORITHM EMPLOYS A METHOD CF CHERNIKOVA FOR DETERMINING 
WHICH EXTREME POINTS OF THE FEASIBLE REGION ARE ADJACENT TO 
A GIVEN EFFICIENT EXTREME POINT. IN COMPARISON WITH AEBASE, 
AN ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURE FOR THE SAME PURPOSES, ADEX WILL 
RUN FASTER ON PROBLEMS WITH HIGHLY DEGENERATE EXTREME POINTS 
BUT ONLY AT THE EXPENSE OF LARGE CORE STORAGE REQUIREMENTS. 

THE CODE IS ACCOMPANIED BY A CCMPREHENSIVE 117 PAGE 
OPERATING MANUAL.

DESCRIPTION - COMPUTERIZED RELATIVE ALLOCATION OF FACILITIES 
TECHNIQUE (CRAFT) ACCEPTS AN INITIAL LAYOUT PATTERN FOR A 
PHYSICAL FACILITY AND GENERATES IMPROVED LAYOUTS. THE 
PROGRAM IS GOVERNED EY HEURISTIC RULES WHICH SEQUENTIALLY 
ALTER LAYOUT PATTERNS WHILE ATTEMPTING TO MINIMIZE VARIABLE 
MATERIAL HANDLING COSTS. INPUTS ARE MATEBIAL HANDLING AND 
FLOW AND COST DATA, AND AN INITIAL LAYOUT OF DEPARTMENTAL 
AREAS. CRAFT GENERATES THE VARIABLE COST OF MATERIAL 
HANDLING FOR THE INITIAL LAYOUT. THE PBCGBAM THEN TRIES 
COMBINATIONS OF TWO DEPARTMENT EXCHANGES, ATTEMPTING TO 
FIND A LESS COSTL1 LAYOUT. MODIFICATIONS CONTINUE UNTIL NO 
FURTHER COST REDUCTION IS POSSIBLE. CRAFT CAN ALSO BE 
BE APPLIED TO ANY MOVEMENT PROELEM THAT CAN BE REPRESENTED 
ON A COST-PER-FOOT BASIS. THE FLOW OF PEOPLE IN AN OFFICE 
LAYOUT IS AN EXAMPLE. CRAFT WAS WRITTEN BY ARMOUR 
(C.1961), REVISED (CRAFT IV) BY FAGNANI IN 1967, FUTHER

DESCRIPTION - A COMPUTER PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED FOR THE 
PROBLEM OF SOLUTE AND WATER MOVEMENT IN UNSATURATED SOILS OR 
POROUS MEDIA UNDER TRANSIENT FLOW CONDITIONS. THE TWO NON- 
LINEAR PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS GOVERNING THE SOLUTE 
AND WATER FLOW ARE SOLVED SIMULTANEOUSLY FOR THE WATER 
CONTENT AND SOLUTE CONCENTRATION AT ANY SPECIFIED TIME AND 
LOCATION AS DESIRED. THE INITIAL CONDITIONS USED ARE 
UNIFORM SALT AND WATER CONTENT DISTRIBUTIONS AT TIME T=0. 
THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AT THE SOIL SURFACE ARE WATER FLUX 
AND CONSTANT SALT CONCENTRATION CONDITIONS. THE METHOD 
OF SOLUTION IS A NUMERICAL ONE WHICH UTILIZES THE EXPLICIT- 
IMPLICIT FINITE DIFFERENCE TECHNIQUE. 

THE COMPUTER PROGRAM IS WRITTEN IN FORTRAN LANGUAGE AND 
CONSISTS OF A SOURCE PROGRAM, ELEVEN SUBPROGRAMS, AND AN 
INPUT DATA SECTION. AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE PROGRAM IS 
THAT INCREMENTAL DISTANCE AND TIME STEPS ARE ADJUSTED 
AUTOMATICALLY TO SATISFY STABILITY AND CONVERGENCE CRITERIA

TWO-STAGE, TWO-DIMENSIONAL TRIM PROGRAM II 

AUTHOR: CAROL E. SHANESY 

DIRECT TECHNICAL INQUIREIS TO: 
CAROL E. SHANESY 

IBM NEW YORK PUBLIC SECTOR OFFICE 
77 WATER STREET 
NEW YORK, NY 10005 

DESCRIPTION - TWO-STAGE, TWO-DIMENSIONAL TRIM PROGRAM 
PROVIDES A LINEAR PROGRAMMING SOLUTION TO THE TWO-STAGE 
TWO DIMENSIONAL TRIM OR CUTTING STCCK PROBLEM. THIS 
PROBLEM CAN BE DESCRIBED BRIEFLY AS FOLLOWS. WE HAVE A 
SUPPLY OF MATERIAL WHICH IS STOCKED (OR ERODUCED) IN ONE OR 
MORE FIXED RECTANGULAR SIZES, EACH SIZE HAVING A FIXED COST 
PER UNIT ASSOCIATED WITH IT. WE ALSO HAVE A LIST OF SMALLER 
RECTANGLE SIZES TOGETHER WITH THE NUMBERS DESIRED OF EACH 
SIZE, WHICH ARE TO EE PRODUCED BY CUTTING UP STOCK-SIZE 
RECTANGLES. IF ANY OF THESE RECTANGLE SIZES (W X L) MAY BE 
CUT EITHER W OR L OR L X W, THE PROGRAM WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE 
OF THIS FREEDOM. THE STOCK-SIZE RECTANGLES ARE CUT IN TWO 
STAGES — FIRST THE RECTANGLE IS SLIT INTO STRIPS WITH 
STRAIGHT CUTS PARALLEL TO THE LENGTH EDGE, AND THEN EACH 
STRIP IS CUT INDIVIDUALLY IN THE PERPENDICULAR DIRECTION. 
THE CHEAPEST WAY OF CUTTING UP STOCK IS TO FILL THE ORDERS 
MUST BE DETERMINED. THE PROGRAM WILL HANDLE UP TO 10 STOCK 
SIZES AND 50 ORDER SIZES, AS PRESENTLY COMPILED. FOR THESE 
DIMENSIONS, THE PROGRAM REQUIRES ABOUT 100,000 BYTES OF 
MEMORY FOR EXECUTION.
