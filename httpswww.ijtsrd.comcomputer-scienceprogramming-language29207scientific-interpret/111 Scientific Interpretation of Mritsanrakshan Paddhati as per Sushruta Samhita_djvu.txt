ABSTRACT 


For whole knowledge of body we have to study anatomy subject theoretically 
also practically. By the dissection of human cadaver. There are several 
methods of dead body preservation in modern science. In Ayurveda , a special 
method for dead body preservation is given by Acharya Sushruta. This method 
is called “Jalnimajjan Paddhati"of Mritsanrakshan". According to Ayurvedic 
texts Acharya Sushruta is best in Sharir Sthan. He is described many 
anatomical structures of human body and useful information of every segment 
of body. He also told about 7 skin layers and their thickness and 7 types of 
Kalas with their order. This was possible because of complete dissection.

INTRODUCTION 

No one can become good in anatomy subject without 
knowing it properly. Because it is the most important branch 
of medical science. In Ayurveda According to Acharya 
Sushruta who knows the anatomy properly by dissecting 
dead body he will definitely good in surgery, because he 
knows the vital parts of body like arteries ( Dhamani ), veins 
[Sira), nerves [Nadi), Marma points etc. to escape from 
injury during surgical process. 1 Acharya Sushruta has told 
about many points of references in his text for selection and 
preservation of the human dead body. These are points are 
like, human dead body (cadaver), having ah its parts of a 
person who has not died by either poison or chronic disease 
or attaining hundred years of age etc. According to Sushruta 
dissection is prime for medical student to gain practical 
command on anatomy subject, that's why he mentioned 
about preservation method and dissection technique of 
cadaver. 

AIM AND OBJECTIVES 

1. To learning the procedure of cadaveric preservation 
mentioned by Sushruta in his text. 


2. To interpretate the terms of procedures he used in his 
text according to modern science. 

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Ayurvedic texts like Sushruta Samhita, Dr. Bhaskar Govind 
Ghanekar commentry on Sushruta Samhita etc. and few 
published articles references. 

INTERPRETATION OF CADAVERIC PRESERVATION 
PROCEDURE ACCORDING TO MODERN SCIENCE- 

Acharya Sushruta used many references in his text for

In this cautation there are some point of references are 

explained like- 

1. ( Samastagatram):- 

> According to Sushruta human dead body (cadaver), 
having all its parts in natural condition not extra or less 
in number. 3 

2. 3iR q i'Ih^ci*i (Avishopahatam): - 

> According to Sushruta person whom body going to be 
preserved has not died by poison. Because due to poison 
body parts are effected and body not remain in its 
natural state. 4 



> According to Sushruta person whom body going to be 
preserved has not died by Chronic diseases because 
these kind of diseases damage the body parts like -In 
leprosy skin is damaged, In syphilis nasal bone and 
other bones are damaged, In gonorrhea penis is 
damaged etc. These kind of body give us wrong 
information about the study of body parts. There is not 
any kind of damage in starting stage of acute diseases so 
if dead body suffered from acute disease previously it 
should be taken for dissection purpose. 5 


5. ( Nisrushtaantrapureesham):- 

> According to Sushruta intestine along with faeces should 
be removed because many bacteria present here and 
they fastly decomposed the dead body. There are two 
kinds of benefit here for removal of intestine with faeces 
that body not decomposed by bacteria and intestine 
available for specimen purpose. 7 


6 . 

> 


(Avagahntyamaapgayam) 


According to Sushruta dead body should be well tied and 
kept in river which has slow running stream so that 
dead body keep contact continue with water and skin 
get soft and moist and body prevent from bed odour. 8 


7. (Nibadhham):- 

> Here Nibandhham word meaning is kept tied as 
previously told. So that body should not flow or drown 
and remain under water. 9 


8. hok< 4 (Panjarastham):- 

> Sushruta told that Dead body should be placed inside a 
cage to protect from water animals. 10 


4. (Avarshashatikam):- 

> Sushruta refuses to take old person's body as well as 
children's body. Because old person's body parts are get 
degenerated like, Changes in skin, fall down of teeth, 
bones become weak, muscles get shrink, ligaments get 
flaccid and in old female body uterus get shrinks. On 
other hand in children body parts are not properly 
developed so we cannot find the natural state of body 
parts. Like total teeth not present, bones not formed 
well etc. That time the maximum age limit is lOOyears so 
above this age the person considered old, Hence 
Sushruta told the term Avarshashatikam which means 
not above the 100 years. But in present era average age 
level diminished so we can take body having age of 50 to 
55 years. 6

(Munjavalkalkushshanadinam Anyatamen 

Aaveshtita Angpratyangam):- 

> Dead Body should be wrapped either with Munja, 
Valkala (inner barks of trees), Kusha (grass part of 

Panch Trinamoola], Shana (hemp) or any such material. 

The reason behind this wrapping should be protect body 

from small water animals like fish etc. 11 

> Because fish may be the reason behind the postmortem 

injury so that the organisms may invaginate in the body 

and decomposed it. 12 And dead body skin get soften for 

dissection purpose. 13

10. 3TCRTTCY chisel (Aprakashdeshe Kothayet:-- 

> According to Sushruta dead Body should be kept in 
hidden dark place and allowed to undergo 
decomposition. The meaning of Aprakashdeshe (dark 
area) is the place where people don't go or harldy go. Or 
the other reason is the water of that dark place not seen 
by people or not used by people so that infection 
through water cannot spread to the people. 23 And 
another reason is for taking dark place for keeping the 
body is that normal people cannot see the dead body. So 
that body should be easily kept there. 24

> Scrubbing the dead body slowly with brushes made 
from Usheer (grass), Bala (hairs), Venu (bamboo), 
Valkala (inner bark of trees), Kurcha (grass part of 
Panch Trinamoola) or any other similar material and 
then the body with all the external ( Bahya ) and internal 
(Abhyantara ) parts like the skin, muscles etc. should be 
fully observed by eyes ( Pratyaksha ). 26 

> The reason behind slow scrubbing of dead body is to see 
the minute structures of body parts and different skin 
layers mentioned by Acharya Sushruta. 27 

CONCLUSION 

Therefore, we can say that Mritasanshodhan Paddhati 
[preservation method of dead body( cadaver)] according to 
Acharya Sushruta has a scientific base at each and every step 
of preservation like keeping body in water or choosing the 
plants for wrapping the body, which have the properties of 
antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, 
antimicrobial, wound purifying and healing and astringent, 
which helps to preserve the body. Now a days in other texts 
the reference about the Mritasanshodhana Paddhati 
(Preservation of dead body) and the type of dissection 
method mentioned, which is the unique contribution from 
Susruta Samhita.
