CHAPTER 1 
STUDY REPORT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 



1 OVERVIEW 



General Electric Simulation and Controls System Department (GE/SCSD) is pleased to submit 
this technical report to NASA Langley Research Center in fulfillment of the Statement of Work 
(SOW), NASl-18711. of May, 1988. 

This report addresses the derivation of requirements for a full color, binocular high resolution, 
wide field of view raster graphics helmet-mounted stereo-capable display suitable for 
application to advanced rotorct^t pilot display interface research. Particular emphasis was 
given to the means by which full color and high resolution could be obtained. Three approaches 
for the physical implementation of the display device were presented to NASA LaRC during the 
conduct of the study, and two of these approaches have been selected for possible development. 
The initial approach selected for long-range development was a laser scanned, high resolution 
system which has been in the initial phases of development at General Electric for three years. 
The second approach chosen seems feasible for more near-term implementation on a helmet 
mounted display (HMD) currently being delivered to NASA LaRC. This second approach 
involves a novel method for deriving full color from a subminialure CRT and a patent 
application has been filed and assigned to NASA LaRC as part of this contract. The 
specifications for the Color Raster Generator Using a Subminiaturc Cathode Ray Tube have 
been delivered to NASA LaRC as a separate document. 

This report is organized as five chapters and two appendices. Chapter One is this rcpon overview 
and summary. 

Chapter Two presents the derivation of research oriented display requirements, which were 
derived from task-related pilot requirements as an initial basis and design goal. This initial set 
was then compared with an absolute minimum requirement set known to be employed with 
current rotorcraft sensor suites, and a research related set was then derived which represents a 
current near-term limit in the state of the art. 

Chapter Three presents an organization and review of the current technology suitable for use in 
producing full color, high resolution display capability required by the HMD. 

Chapter Four presents the three design approaches chosen for presentation to NASA LaRC for 
further development. These included the laser scanned approach, a Thin-Film Tran.sistor Liquid 
Crystal Display approach, and the subminiature color CRT approach. 

Chapter five presents the summary and conclusions of the study. 

Appendix A states a Development Plan for the Laser Scanned system. 

Appendix B states the Specifications for the Laser Scanned HMD system. 



CHAPTER 2 

2 DISPLAY REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS 

2.1 OVERVIEW 

Task related observer requirements were devised to determine an initial goal set of maximum 
display requirements. It was found that out-the-window target acquisition requirements 
appropriate for air combat maneuvering called for display field-of-view, resolution, scene 
luminance and contrast levels far beyond what would be useful and affordable for rotorcraft 
research. These initial requirements were compared with a set of minimum requirements known 
to be used in worst-case conditions by AH-64 test pilots.An achievable set of research 
requirements was then derived which would exceed minimum requirements handily and 
provide the field-of-view, resolution and fiiD color capability necessary to investigate the utility 
of color and stereo viewing with various display formats. 

22 DISPLAY REQUIREMENTS DERIVATION 

Display requirements were derived to suit the intended use of the Helmet Mounted Display 
(HMD) system and as directed in the Statement of work (SOW). The stated usage is for research 
in rotorcraft advanced cockpit applications, where full color, high resolution and adjustable 
wide field of view will permit examining stereopsis, eye dominance, possible display format 
conflicts with out-the-window (OTW) scene content and other factors for which insufficient 
color HMD display performance data exists. Indeed, there are fundamental questions as to how 
best to use full color beyond the usual categorical coding applications for displayed data. 
Ultimately, the display is to be developed into a flight-rated device, but the initial requirements 
are for a research device which will be driven by a small visual system which will present 
various reticles, maps, weapons and systems status symbology, but which is not intended to 
present fiill out-the-window imagery. 

This chapter presents the findings of Task l.The objective of that task was the derivation of the 
requirements for a helmet-mounted display (HMD), specifically the identification of the 
advanced cockpit environment in which that display will interface, the determination of 
task-related activities as these will affect the display requirements, and the link between those 
and the total system requirements. 

Display requirements for the helmet display were derived from rotorcraft flight task and 
observer requirements, which are beyond required display capabilities, and from empirically 
determined minimum flight-related sensor operating requirements, which are the very 
minimum to be of any use. From these, a set of research requirements was derived which are 
achievable and which call for sufficient field of view and resolution to allow various data 
display fonnats to be evaluated. The resulting display requirements are more stringent than 
minimum (sensor derived) requirements and less stringent than the eye-limited observer related 
requirements for target acquisition. The user display requirements in a rotorcraft operational 
setting ideally would ideally mimic the field of view and resolution characteristics of the (good) 
observer. ACM target acquisition task requirements drive this. 

On the other hand, operational sensor display usage in IFR/night conditions has been shown to 
be effective with as little as 30 by 40 degree fields of view, although this requires the pilot to 
slew his head over a wide area to obtain situation awareness. Qearly, the helmet display research 
requirements should be laiger than this in order to investigate improved display formats and less 
than the ultimate hemispherical coverage with one arcminute resolution, since this is not 
concurrently achievable with helmet visor optics or the raster generator. 



23 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY FOR FLIGHT RELATED REQUIREMENTS 

The preliminary step in determining the observer display requirements is a cockpit 
configuration analysis based on extensive literature review and pilot interviews. (1) The focus 
of that analysis is a chronology of cockpit configurations, from the traditional knobs and dials, 
to 2-D and 3-D visual representations. 

The next step in the determination of display requirements follows a top-down design (Figure 
2.3-1). Task-related observer requirements arc identified by mission type. Visual cues with 
display content and scene characteristics necessary for each mission are identified, with 
missions further broken dovm into phases with subtasks. That yields required information, 
which identifies the needed visual information cues and the rules that govern displays. Visual 
information cues, plus rules, determine display representation, which, in turn, drives the display 
requirements. 

2.4. COCKPIT CONnGURATION ANALYSIS 

The changing nature of warfare and the concomitant complexity of modem aircraft have had 
profound impacts on cockpit design considerations. The crux of the matter is the study of the 
"human factors equation, finding what it is about human needs and wants, and man's physical 
and emotional capabilities and limitations, that, when taken into account in cockpit design and 
development, actually improve pilot and aircraft performance." (2) 

While there is a multitude of issues in cockpit design (3), this study focuses only on in-cockpit 
representation of information with particular emphasis on advanced imagery and man-machine 
interfaces as they relate to helmet-mounted display requirements. The discussion that follows 
is drawn from three primary sources of information: avionics literature (4); past experience 
with ir>-cockpit imagery design; and pilot interviews. 

2.5. FROM CONVENTIONAL TOOLS TO ADVANCED IMAGERY 

The traditional representation of in-cockpit information for aircraft and rotorcraft has consisted 
of discrete dials and knobs. As airborne conditions have become more intense, particularly in 
the military arena, those discrete toolshave proliferated by a factor of ten in the past thirty years. 
A World War I fighter had 10 to 15 gauges, controls and instruments; and there were about 35 
in a P-51 Mustang of World War II vintage. By the 1960s, the F-111 carried some 200 
instruments, with the F-15 carrying over 300. (5) The human factors issue is task overioad for 
the pilot: the discrete representation of information places the total burden of interpretation on 
the pilot, who needs to filter out a large amount of information in a very short time. Eariy human 
engineering efforts focused on properly grouping and arranging the instruments according to 
system and function and on making the maridngs legible. Display integration was very limited 
and selective display was just not possible with the hardware involved. 

The use of video instruments and the evolution of electronics in the cockpit, primarily in the 
form of the conventional instrumentation replaced by multi-function CRT displays, has not 
entirely alleviated the problems of pilot workload. According to one researcher: 

"Data or symbols presented on these displays 
are highly codified, requiring their meaning 
to be learned and responses trained at higher 
cognitive levels. Although [the cockpit] 
presents more DATA to the pilot, it does not 
necessarily provide more INFORMATION, as the 
human is not able to assimilate all that is 
presented to him simultaneously." (6)

Additionally, twcMlimensional video presentations have failed to address the nature ofhuman 
sensors. Human senses operate in 3-D, hence, traditional 2-D can provide only a "peephole" 
into the actual 3-D world. For pilots, Uiis results in "scnsor/mismaich 

information/overload",(7) that is particularly acute in times of stress. 

As illustrated in Table 2.5-1, a "giant leap" forward in a qualitative direction has not occurred 
in the current cockpit configuration. For example, instrument numbers, location and 
Field-of-View (FOV) are fixed, data are observer selected and exceeds the observer's 
bandwidth.

Research and development on advanced avionics design for future fixed- and rotor-wing 
aircraft are incoiporating the human factors- based impetus for a technological break from 
conventional and 2-D representation to 3-D, integrated and virtual display formats. The trend 
in advanced avionics design is following what the Air Force Systems Command calls 
"mindware", (8) defined as follows: 

Symbolic information and display knowledge representations; 
Multi-sensory and perceptual organization of presented data; 
Interface control structure(s); and 
Wholistic design principles of human-system interface design. 



2.4.2. SYMBOLIC INFORMATION AND DISPLAY KNOWLEDGE 
REPRESENTATION 

The research and development in this area centers primarily on finding the most optimum 
display representation for the pilot. A primary element of this research is the movcmcni toward 
3-D representation of information, projected on a wide FOV on innovative types of displays, 
and moving toward a "virtual" world in the cockpit. While specific findings arc beyond the 
scope of the present study, the challenge is to find that optimum human-system interface design, 
which, in essence, needs a match between types of human organizational elements and salicncy. 
The sub-components of these include: 

Sensory Organization Object Saliency 

Intensity 
Contrast 
Color 
Legibility 

Perceptual Organization Pattern Saliency 
Spatial Arrangement 
Temporal Arrangement 

Cognitive Organization Decision Saliency 

Problem Framing 
Semantics Structure 
Interface Control Structure 



2.4.3. MULTI-SENSORY AND PERCEPTUAL ORGANIZATION OF PRESENTED 
DATA 

Along with increasing 3-D visual representation of information, advanced avionics incorporate 
control by new methods, such as voice and eye contact. Sound is generated in 3-D, which not 
only allows increased sensory capability, but also positional hearing; sound acts as a pointer 
for a radius of 3-5 degrees. The future development of Super Cockpits includes an 
ultra-high-fidelity sound system that will act as the pointer for objects and targets, and also 
serve as a voice-operated weapon-system command. Coupled with this, research is now 
ongoing for a mechanism that will allow the pilot to move objects on the screen with simple 
movement of the eyes. 

2.4.4. INTERFACE CONTROL STRUCTURE(S) 

One aspect of interface control is rapid reconfiguration of controls and displays, with easy 
conversion between air-to-air and air-to-ground combats. Advanced aircraft and rotorcraft 
will have on-board display libraries from which the pilot can choose the display format he 
needs, as well as change it. Map inserts and video-mixing are currently being incorporated in 
some flight simulators. Rapid reconfiguration has direct relevance to helmet-mounted displays. 
Certain status monitor information displays, such as fuel gauges and altitude will be presented 
to the pilot with symbology: characters; and icons. However, terrain mapping for mission 
status and tactical information will be displayed with imagery in helmet displays. Since these 
are essentially TV images, imagery is readily adaptable to reconfigurable controls. 



2.4.4.1. WHOLISTIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN-SYSTEM INTERFACE 

If the pilot needs a "virtual" world presented to him, there also needs to be an integration of 
sensor imagery and Heads-up-Display (HUD) symbology with HMDs, or total projection of 
imagery through the HMD. With some variation between developers of Super Cockpits, the 
HUD is generally the primary display, with the HMD providing the visual imagery, including 
terrain, targeting information, weapons information and threat data. However, there is 
increasing research on "stand-alone" helmets that will give the pilot a wide FOV with 
projection of "the world as it is really organized so he can orient his eye to something in space 
and interact with it." (9) 

2.5. TASK RELATED VISUAL INFORMATION AND DISPLAY REQUIREMENTS 
2.5.L MISSION TASK ANALYSIS 

Missions may be categorized by type. Each mission may, in turn, be broken into a sequence 
oftasks, each of which may be trained separately. Tasks, intum, may be further subdivided into 
subtasks, each requiring infomiation from within (via instruments) or from outside the cockpit, 
via the visual scene. Radar and Forward-Looking-Infra-Rcd (FLIR) indications, of course, 
are generated by displays within the cockpit on the instrument panel, on HMD devices, or on 
a HUD. 

2.5.2. MISSION TYPES 

Missiontypes vary greatly in their requirements for Out-the- Window (QTW) visual scenes and 
fidehty or richness of visual cues. Instrument flight, in fact, requires no visual cues, except for 
the initial phases of taxi andtakeoff and the final phases of approach and landing. In the visual 
presentation for rotorcraft, nap-of-the-earth (NOE) flight, poses the most stringent 
requirements for visual cue presence, with the pilot spending a minimum of time "head down" 
looking at instruments. 

To find the maximum requirements for displays, four mission types have been isolated: 
Nap-of-the-Earth (NOE); Search and Rescue (SAR); Air-to-Ground (A/G) Combat; and 
Air-to-Air (A/A) Intercept. These are discussed below. 

2.5.2.L NAP-OF-THE-EARTH 

The most stringent requirement for rotorcraft, and the most critical, is terrain following and 
terrain avoidance (TF/TA). Because of the necessary tradeoff between masked time and speed, 
identification of objects relevant to the progress of the flight is crucial. In terms of synthetic 
imagery for OTW, the pilot needs cues with high object detail for distance perspective relative 
to motion. One such motion perspective can be provided with a 3-D "time-to-impact" depth 
map of the visual fields. Additionally, the Arca-of-Interest (AOI) needs to be head-directed 
with a relatively small FOV. 

2.5.2.2. SEARCH AND RESCUE 

In a typical SAR mission, the pilot relies heavily on on-board navigational infomiation systems 
and displays, and on radio contact with ground stations. Aircraft fiight symbology and enhanced 
navigational display features provide important information, with synthetic imagery generated 
in-cockpit needing high detail object identification. Sensor systems, including LLLTV, FLIR 
or radar could be configured to provide a limited set of cues on a helmet display to aid visual 
acquisition as an alternate format. 



2^.2J. AIR-TO-GROUND COMBAT 

A/G Combat requires extensive flight operations at low altitude. Terrain following and terrain 
avoidance for low level flight demand highly detailed visual scenes, and navigation to and from 
targets, which is highly task-intensive, requires an electronic tactical map. The pilot needs 
continuously updated situational awareness information with threat locations. A 3-D (lop 
perspective) tai^et map with range, location, distance from ownship, capability, and 
representation of moving ownship will provide important visual cue information for that 
situational awareness. For threat information, a tactical display of the ground order of battle 
is important forupdating information on the dynamic movement of enemy ground targets. Fl^IR 
imagery of weapons deployment results is also critical for A/G flight. Where out-lhc-window 
scene information is present, synthetic or sensor derived video should be distorted and scaled 
to match the perspective of the observed scene, as seen through the visor This reduces visual 
data conflicts. 

2S.2A. AIR-TO-AIR INTERCEPT 

In an air-to-air intercept scenario, the pilot relies heavily on ground controlled intercept 
instructions and uses the on-board air-to-air radar extensively. The intercept usually involves 
flight in clouds and instrument conditions. The pilot needs target idcntincation of 
Friend-or-Foe (IFF) before engagement, and situational assessment for Probability of kill (Pk) 
of ownship and target, maneuverability and location of target, and coordination of sensors and 
missiles. As in A/G, weapons deployment results are critical. 

2J.3. INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS 
2^.3.1. MISSION PHASES AND SUBTASKS 

Each mission type has a set of phases with subtasks and required information necessary to 
complete those subtasks. Table 2.5.3,1-1 illustrates the relationship between mission phases, 
subtasks and information requirements for air-to-air intercept. 

2J.3.2. DISPLAY CONTENT 

From the visual cue analysis and the mission-related information requiremcnLs, it is possible 
to categorize the minimum display contents that the system must provide: 

a. Generation and Presentation of Ownship Information; 

b. Generation and Representation of Flight Information; 

c. Imaging Sensors; 

d. Sensor Integration; 

e. 3-D Synthetic Terrain Display (On-Board Decision-Aid); 

f. 3-D Moving Maps; 

g. Radar Information;

2^.6. RULES FOR DISPLAY 

The shift from conventional through current to advanced in-cockpit imagery, or display foraiat 
representation, has not eliminated some fundamental man-machine design questions. In fact, 
we have more questions than answers, so far. For example: 

b. In what format should information be presented? 

c. What simultaneous information does the pilot need to see? 

d. How much simultaneous imagery is needed? 

e. Should all types of information presented to the pilot be color? 
And if so, how much color is enough (too much)? 

f. What is the proper mix of symbology and imagery? 

g. What methods will be used for "de-cluttering" the screen? 
h. Where should information be presented? 

i. What is the optimum physical configuration of the displays? 



15 



j. How is a focal point of interest generated for the pilot? 

k. How is tactical information communicated to or from the pilot? 

1. Should information be completely integrated? 

m. Is there a need for separate display of particular transitory features? 

0. How is critical (or any) information prioritized? 

p. How is the pilot to select which data and formats to use? 

q. How much of the data display sequence should be automated? 

r. How can data best be combined to present information? 

It is possible, however, to delineate some rules for information display heuristics. The 
recommended foimat for the visual cues is listed in Table 2.5.6-1. Use those rules as a point 
of departure. Listed below are some of the rules, far from exhaustive, that relate directly to 
representation of in-cockpit information. 

a. Every control and display should be logical, accessible and readable. 

b. Cockpit design should be consistent in the use of displays and functions. 

c. As far as possible, displays should be standardized, both in terms of 
symbology and color. 

d. When possible, pictorial representation should take priority over any other 
display 

format. 

e. Alphanumerics without accompanying symbols should be used sparingly. 

f. Displays and controls for like functions should be grouped together and 
encourage 

viewing and operation from left to right, top to bottom, or back to front. (10) 

g. Information should only be displayed at the needed time. 

h. To reduce the amount of infomiation displayed, especially at critical times, a 

declutter option should be provided to the pilot, 
i. Zoom capabilities should be available to reduce clutter.

IS.l. EMPIRICALLY DERIVED MINflMUM DISPLAY REQUIREMENTS 

Interviews with AH-64 test pilots determined that pilots can use sensor sights at night for 
nai>-of-the earth flight, even with their limited fields of view. The pilot insdnciively alters his 
normal daylight viewing behavior by sweeping the sight (PNVS) left and right to view the 
terrain on either side of the flight path, thereby obtaining enough scene infomiation to provide 
"situation awareness" and avoid terrain contact. No doubt clearance altitude is increased and 
airspeed is reduced, compared to daytime conditions. While tasks can be performed under these 
conditions, the field of view is marginal at best and oitly serves to peg the minimum 
instantaneous field of view a helmet display should be capable of. The depicted scene is in 
monochrome, but luminance levels, contrast, resolution, update rates and other factors arc 
comparable to what one would require for the research HMD, field of view being the primary 
detractor. This situation represents a "worst case" requirement context. 

2^.8. RESEARCH RELATED REQUIREMENTS 

Research requirements were derived to obtain the maximum performance available with 
current technology. The traditional "big three" display factors of field of view, resolution and 
perceived luminance were juggled to provide a set of requirements which greatly exceed the 
worst case sensor derived requirements and are less than the best case, but currently 
unobtainable, instantaneous field of view and resolution demanded by an observer's air-to-air 
target acquisition task. Image quality and stereo factors were also included. 

The following factors were among those considered: 

1. The field of view was set by the widest available visor choice which still permitted 

reasonable resolution to be displayed. The image generator is not required to provide 
full out-the-window scenes, but the wide format is required to investigate how data and 
information may best be presented within and around the OTW scene observed through 
the visor. 

2. The resulting resolution available is approximately 3 arc-minutes per pixel, which is 

sufficient for the symbology and data formats likely to be investigated, but insufficient 
for long range target acquisition, which is not required. 

3. Luminance levels and contrasts afforded by the laser scanned system are excellent. Visor 

optical characteristics permit good ambient scene throughput (>50%) and good display 
throughput so that relative luminance levels of the display with respect to the ambient 
scene may be varied over a wide range. 

4. Scan parameters of line and field rates are sufficiently high as to be adequate for the 

presentation of flicker-free imagery of good image quality. These factors should not 
confound the measurement of observer performance data for the formats chosen to be 
investigated. 

5. Provisions for adjusting the center of the display to each eye is provided to allow a full 

range of stereopsis (0 to 40 degrees) to be investigated and to allow for anthropometric 
variance in interocular distance over 5th to 95th percentiles. The exact mechanical 
arrangement for doing this will be implemented during the development and 
integrafion of the scanner subsystem with the visor optic subsystem. 

1JS.9. REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY 

Figures 2.5.9-1 through 2.5.9-6 depict the requirements for the helmet display system, as are 
required for the intended use of the HMD as a research tool. 



21 



2.5.10. SUMMARY 

From the foregoing analysis, it is possible to set display requirements for the rotorcraft HMD. 
While specific technologies will be analyzed and reported as part of Task 2, a brief summary 
of findings is presented here to conclude Task 1. 

The information requirements and representation analysis has yielded some boundaries for the 
HMD. The FOV ranges from 30 by 40 to 80 by 1 80 degrees with high resolution. Update rates 
range from 1 to 60 Hz (Table 2.5.6-1). Except for sensor information, projected imagery will 
need to be in full color with translucency. 

Following trends in advanced avionics, the rotorcraft HMD will need to project 3-D imagery, 
situational awareness data, maps, a relatively large number of moving models, symbols, and 
graphics. The helmet will also have to integrate HUD and sensor infonnation by overiay or by 
separate channels. Based on the task-related information cue analyses, the most stringent 
requirement for the system will come from NOE flight, where high-detail object identification 
and synthetic terrain are needed. AAj combat and A/A intercept pose the most stringent 
requirements on moving models, and 3-D threat and target information.

Pilots from the Center for Advanced Ainnanship (CAA) and on-site at Daytona Beach 
were interviewed on several occasions to determine pilot preferences for display format 
and location. These interviews were conducted over a year span and includes 
round-table "brainstorming sessions", open-ended questionnaires, and closed 
(quantitative) questionnaires.

CHAPTER 3 

3. TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 

3.1. PURPOSE 

This chapter will serve to address the Task 2 requirements stated in the Statement of Work 
(SOW). In summary, the SOW requires: 1. preparation of a taxonomy matrix of technologies 
showing developmental risks and potential performance gains as a function of time, and, 2. .an 
assessment of new enabling technologies and HMD media,. These key subiasks will be 
addressed to most quickly derive the key characterizes of all HMD approaches, determine 
where current technology limitations exist and what design approaches are best for both 
generating full color, high resolution images and overcoming limitations of current designs. 
From that basis, we define what enabling technologies are required and what risks arc involved. 

3.2. APPROACH 

All HMD designs employ components both on and off-helmet as part of the overall system. 
It is important to minimize the weight and size of on-helmet components while providing good 
displayed image quality. All HMD systems must have some form of visor optics and eye 
and/or head-tracking components on-helmet. In addition, a real image of the scenes to be 
depicted must also be available for use by the visor optics and subsequent viewing by the 
observer. The raster generator which forms the images and the visor optic components are the 
two key subsystems which characterize an HMD design and are the two areas most needing 
development for color HMD designs. The fundamental requirements arc to allocate the 
heavy, bulky components of the raster generator off-helmet, minimize the size and weight 
ofon-helmet components and provide a small, flexible umbilical between the two. (Sec Figure 
3.2-1). 

33. RASTER GENERATOR TAXONOMY MATRIX 

A properly organized taxonomy matrix is an effective means of conveying the manner by 
which a color raster may be generated for HMD use. This approach may be shown to 
categorize existing color and monochromatic HMD display processes, and it allows the 
characteristics of new technologies to be weighed effectively as they would apply to a new 
helmet design. Such a matrix is depicted in Figure 3.3-1, where the fundamental assumption 
is that the image will be a raster format, suitable for use with a color image generator with 
traditional, or only slightly modified, video output formats. The principle characierisiic 
is where pixel luminance is first generated: on-helmet or off-helmet and whatly pc of scanning 
is used. The visoroptic type is also a key discriminant. Generated off-helmet, an image pixel's 
luminance must be transferred to the helmet via optical fibers or fiber arrays. Scanning may 
be at each, either or both ends. On-helmet pixel luminance generation rcqui res electronic video 
data transfer to the helmet via coaxial cables for scanning processes on-helmcl. 

The organization of the matrix in this particular form seemed to most clearly delineate where 
available and near term technology could be used for providing a color image. It is also ba.scd 
on an overview of existing helmet designs.

HMD TYPE 



NAME 



NOTES 



Off-Helmet Pixel Luminance Processes 

Table 3.3-1 lists examples of existing HMD designs which may be caicgorizcd by the 
taxonomy matrix of raster generation processes. For each process, there is a limited set of 
technology which may be applied. 

1. None Known The scan rates required to mechanically scan a single pixel 

on-helmet are excessive. Acousio-oplic scanning is possible 
at the required rates, but multiple wavelength (color) 
deflection is an issue with A-0 scanners. 



2. GE IR&D 



VDRT (NTSC) 



4. FOHMD (CAE) 



Painting multiple (eight or more) scan lines simultancou.sly 
allows scan rates to be reduced to where galvonomelcr mirror 
scanners are possible. Underdevelopment. La.scr. sources u.sed 
for high luminance and arc off-helmet. 

The VDRT system has been under development for several 
years. Lasers provide luminance which is scanned 
horizontally to form a scan line which is then sent to the helmet 
via a coherent optic fiber strip. Vertical scanning, projection 
on a dome then follows. Limited image quality. 

The CAE HMD system enjoys some success and is currently 
the only wide FOV, good resolution, full color HMD design in 
use. Four GE light valves provide complete rasters for two 
background and two movable inset rasters. The primary 
deficit is the coherent fiberoptic bundle required to convey the 
images is bulky and inflexible as an umbilical. 



Orv-Helmet Pixel Luminance Processes 



Many CRT HMDs 



All monochrome HMD designs which employ sub- 
miniature CRTs as raster generators use this approach. Color 
is possible with field sequential color filters (rotating wheel), 
butimageedge artifacts occur with motion. Beam penetration 
phosphors provide a limited color selection suitable for use as 
reticle/status displays. Multiple CRT (RGB) approaches are 
possible with weight and size penalties. LCD panels are typed 
here as 3-D arrays, rather than two-axis scanned point pixels.

Off-Helmet Pixel Luminance Processes 

6. not known Multipoint oi>-4ielmet pixels could be scanned mechanically 

to provide a high resolution, full color raster if the luminance 
sources can be made small and bright enough. This would be a 
variation of the Type 2 approach, where fibers could be 
replaced with RGB solid-state laser chip arrays. Visible 
RGB lasers are under rapid development. Currently, blue is 
generated by frequency doubling techniques using YAGor 
other crystals, which limit video modulation rates. 



7. GE/NASA 



8. Private Eye 



9. All LCDs 



Full color may be generated on-4ielmet by using a special 
subminiature CRT to scan RGB data in the horizontal (fast) 
axis, while using a galvanometer mirror for vertical scanning. 
Fast RGB phosphors are required to prevent image smearing 
and special techniques must be used to provide good 
luminance without burning the phosphor. 

This inexpensive system employs an oscillating mirror to scan 
alineararray ofredLEDsto form a complete image. Coloris 
possible with an array ofRGBLEDs (underdevelopment). It 
is currently in development and in limited use as a personal 
computer or terminal display. Worn on a headband, it could 
be adapted for HMD use if brightness, resolution, green and 
blue color LEDs and scan stability (one/eye) issues are 
resolved. 

Miniature LCD panels are widely underdevelopment, 
particularly in Japan. Small, thin, light and requiring little 
power, they offer promises of full color panels which could 
be used directly or as three monochrome panels, each backlit 
with RGB light (e.g. Kodak LC-5(X) projector). The 
requirements for small image size and high resolution are 
beyond current manufacturing capability, but development is 
rapid. The large number of interconnects demanded by high 
resolution require that row/column address decode circuits 
be incorporated on the display, increasing its size. Several 
non see-through HMDs are in use as research tools (NASA 
JSC) and improved versions are underdevelopment.

3.4. COLOR CAPABLE TECHNOLOGY FACTORS 
3.4.1. LUMINANCE GENERATION COMPONENTS 

Generating a raster can be done a number of ways, each requiring one or more color emitiing 
pixels be scanned in some manner to form the raster. Off-helmet pixel luminance generation 
is conveyed to the helmet via optical fibers and the luminous ends arc imaged di rcclly or scanned 
and imaged. On-helmet luminance sources and additional scanning components, if required, 
must be small, light weight and not generate excessive heat. More luminance energy is 
available from off-helmet sources, since size and weight are not primary constraints. The 
choice of on-helmet luminance sources is more limited, particularly where coloris required. 

Off-helmet pixel luminance sources for point, multipoint , 2D-array or 3D arrays must be 
conveyed to the helmet via optical fibers. A single fiber would be needed for a point pixel, 
multiple separate fibers for multipoint, a linear fiber array for a 2D-array and a coherent fiber 
bundle for 3D arrays which convey a complete image. Obviously, luminance sources must be 
modulatable at high speed (up to 40 Mhz), be full color and be optically coupled tightly to the 
fibers. Being off-helmet, size, weight, heat generation and other requirements arc less stringent 
than for on-helmet devices and more choices exist. 

3.4.1.1. GAS LASERS 

Gas lasers are mature technology, and as such, are obvious choices for off-helmet pixel 
luminance generation for several reasons. Units are available off-the-shelf which output red, 
greenorblue wavelengths at power levels which range from < 1 mW to tens of watts, much more 
than is available from CRTs, light valves or other off-helmet sources. A full gamut of color 
is available over a broader range, saturation and purity than can be generated by other sources. 
Red, green and blue beams must be separately modulated at fast rates (up to 40 Mhz) by 
suitable devices, such as the Acousto-Optic-Modulator (AOM). These devices arc also 
available off-the-shelf at the required speeds. The separately modulated beams must be 
combined and input to the optical fibers with suitable optical components, including dichroic 
reflective combiner elements and lenses for collimation and input to and from the modulators. 
These elements are also widely available. 

The number of separate laser pixels required wiU depend on the design approach cho.scn and 
whether scanning occurs off-helmet. Multiple laser beams can be generated from a single 
source by using mirror/beamsplitter combinations which permit each beam to be separately 
modulated and combined. 

Laser HMD designs are in use where line scanning occurs off-helmet and the complete scan line 
is conveyed to the helmet (NTSC VDRT projector) via a linear fiber array. A vertical scanner 
is mounted on the helmet which projects the complete image on a dome. Due to variance 
intransmissivity, image quality is poor ("streaky") when projected, and dome costs and size are 
issues. 

A off-helmet laser system under research at GE and proposed for development by NASA 
LaRC uses eight discrete fibers per eye and scanning occurs in both axes on the helmet. 
Coupling efficiency is greater and variance in fibertransmissivity may be compensated for The 
umbilical is expected to be small and flexible. Image quality, brightness and resolution are 
expected to be good. 



39 



3.4.1^. SOLID STATE LASERS 

Solid state laser diodes and diode arrays for color generation have only recently become 
available on the open market. Solid state lasers offer several important benefits as pixel 
luminance choices. First, if the laser directly emits light at the correct color, then direct 
modulation is possible at high video rates. This is currently not the case with blue, which is 
obtained by frequency doubling from infra-red wavelengths using YAG niobaic compound 
crystals. Such crystals exhibit minimum drive level thresholds (become non-linear), have 
limited conversion efficiency (10-20%) and have limited modulation rates (-40 kHz), which 
are too slow for video. The evolution of solid state lasers is primarily an area involving 
molecular physics and manufacturing processes, but considerable development is in progress 
and it is expected that solid state lasers will supplant many gas lasers in new product designs. 

Another particularly good characteristic of these devices is size. The chips themselves can be 
very small (< 1mm) and the emitting area can also be very small and suitable for direct imaging. 
Some edge-emitting IR devices used for laser printers (Kodak) have exit apertures < 10 
microns in size. Such small size is perfect for mounting the pixel source on the helmet or 
in an array which can be scanned on the helmet. High luminance from small devices requires 
the use of a heat sink, but the small image required by a HMD limits the output needed if an 
efficient visor is used. Materials and manufacturing processes required to obtain all three colors 
are evolving from vendors such as Amoco. Costs are currently comparable or higher than gas 
lasers of equal power, but are expected to drop dramatically in the next few years as 
manufacturing processes improve. Processing is comparable to some phases of integrated 
circuit production. These lasers can be efficiently coupled to optical fibers directly by 
means of gradient-index (GRIN) lenses. 

Eye safety is an issue with either gas or solid state laser units. The GE R&D approach uses 
a rear projection screen to form an image suitable for use with the visor optic relay lens, 
which should increase the exit pupil size and avoids the observer seeing the laser beam directly. 
An additional safety factor is to implement sensors which cut off the lasers if .scanning fails. 

3.4.13. LIGHT EMITTING DIODES 

Light emitting diodes for IR, red, yellow and green have been on the open market for over a 
decade. Blue LEDs using a silicon substrate have been on the market for only about two years. 
These are currently produced with low yields by Siemens and recently by Crce Research, using 
high-purity silicon. Panasonic dropped out of the market, but continues research. The 
Siemens units have low luminance and low switching rates (< 1 MHz), making them 
unsuitable for use as single pixel luminance sources. Super bright red LEDs employing 
Gallium Aluminum Arsenide and phosphide compounds (GAASP) exhibit high output (>100 
milicandelas)and fast switching speeds (>25 MHz). Arrays of these are use in HMDs (Private 
Eye). Green LEDs have moderate luminance output (-40 mcd) and moderate switching 
speeds (<7 MHz). They may be used in arrays, but present an unsaturated, yellow-green color. 
Siemens constructed and delivered several devices employing a quad array of one super red, 
one green and two blue LEDs for testing as color luminance sources. Switching speeds, 
low output and difficulty coupling it to a small fiber prevented it's use in the GE R&D HMD 
brassboard. It is expected that luminance output (particularly blue) and switching speeds will 
improve in the next few years. Cree research is investigating manufacturing processes which 
permit constructing improved diodes ofaU three wavelengths on a common high-purity 
silicon substrate. These devices may be directly applicable as either on-hclmet pixel 
luminance sources in the next five years. Costs (and luminance output) arc considerably lower 
than solid state lasers. 



40 



3.7.4.1.4. LIGHT VALVES 

Light valve projectors are suitable for use off-helmet as color sources of complcic images. 
Their output must be optically coupled to a coherent fiber optical bundle for transmission to 
the helmet, where it is imaged on the visor optics. Coupling of a two-dimensional, raster 
scanned color image to acoherent, two-dimensional array of fibers is not easily done without 
producing image quality problems. The luminance is carried only by the core of the optical 
fiber, which may have a cross-sectional area as litUe as one percent of the total fiber's area with 
it's surrounding cladding. Coupling efficiency is diminished accordingly, since only a small 
proportion of the image is transferred by the core, that in the cladding being lost by scattering 
and absorption. Further, fibers must be made as small as possible in order to have an umbilical 
which is not unduly stiff or large. CAE's successful FOHMD color HMD couples the images 
of four GE light valves, two for background imagery, two for high resolution sets, over four 
coherent bundles. The resulting umbilical is unduly cumbersome and somewhat inhibits 
natural head motion by the pilot. 

The polished ends of the coherent bundle consists of a fiber array in which only the core of 
each fiber transmits scene luminance information. The reconstructed image on the other 
end exhibits a "chickenwire" appearance when viewed and resolution is limited to half the fiber 
pitch. The most commonly used method of dealing with the image quality and resolution 
issues, when a broad-band luminance source is used, is to employ a matching pair of prisms 
at each end of the fiber to smear an individual pixel's information across multiple fibers 
according to the wavelength of the pixel luminance. Constant deviation prisms arc used and 
the process is termed "wavelength multiplexing", since a portion of each pixel's information 
is transmitted by multiple fibers. Artifacts, including the "black dot" appearance of broken 
fibers, are much reduced, although not totally eliminated, and resolution is improved by, 
typically,afactoroftwo. A similar problem exists forthe NTSCVDRT la.scr helmet projector, 
which sends a complete scan line to the helmet via a coherent linear fiber array for subsequent 
vertical scanning and projection. The narrow bandwidth of laser light obviates the use of 
wavelength multiplexing techniques and image quality suffers. 

3.4.1^. CATHODE RAY TUBES 

CRT projectors may be employed in the same manner as light valve projectors, but fewer 
lumens are available. Coupling efficiency and umbilical issues common lo the light valve 
system remain. CRTs are a mature technology and costs arc low. 

3.4.L6. SUBMINIATURE CRTS 

Helmet display requirements have driven the design and development of subminiature CRTs 
for over two decades. Active screen sizes may be as small as 1/2 inch (Hughes), with typical 
CRT/deflection yoke weights as low as 800 grams (Thomas Electronics). No existing 
subminiature CRTs offer full color, since shadow masks cannot be manufactured forsuch small 
devices, nor can phosphor triads be deposited. Luminance output and resolution would be 
too low as well. Limited color is available from beam penetration CRTs at sufficient brightness 
to be useful as a reticle or system status HMD. Research over the last several years has 
addressed higher luminance output, more bum-resistant phosphors (single-crystal types), 
but manufacturing problems remain involving thermal expansion coefficient mismatches and 
transfer efficiency of the screen luminance. Additional research has significantly improved 
visor designs, with newer approaches (holographic elements) offering higher throughput 
efficiency and good ambient or outside visibility as well. 

Resolution of the subminiature CRTs depends on the display spot size, which is a function of 
electron gun design and spot "blooming" that may occur as electron beam currents increase 
at the highest luminance output levels. For a CRT with a 1-inch active area, present limiLs are 



41 



slightly over 1000 lines, depending on the phosphor used. Single crystal phosphors have 
excellent spot characteristics and are used for electron gun testing. Screen luminance goals have 
been driven by the inefficiency of display visors with very inefficient optical transfer, such as 
the Farrand Pancake Window (< 7 percent), but newerholographicsysiems will surmount 
the problem with four to five times better transfer efficiency. Costs are only several thousand 
dollars per CRT/yoke assembly and are not expected to change appreciably in the next few 
years. Research continues. 

Full color may be obtained from one or more subminiature monochrome CRTs by several 
methods. A field-sequential approach using a single, while-phosphor CRT will generate full 
color images if a synchronized RGB color segmented filter wheel is spun in front of the screen. 
At least one HMD has used this process and color imagery was sent from the moon using this 
approach at the camera end. Image quality problems are observed for objects which translate 
through the scene quickly, as would be the case with head motion. Colors are generated at detail 
edges due to the slow update cycle of each color in sequence. Resolution is good, since no 
shadow masks are involved. 

Atripletof red,greenand blue-phosphored subminiature CRTs could present high resolution, 
full color and good luminance by optically combining the images from all three. For stcrcopsis, 
six CRTs would add considerable weight and bulk to an HMD. 

A mixed design employing one subminiature CRT (per eye) to produce full color has been 
devised for this contract. Shadow mask or grille designs are not feasible and abeam-indexed 
stripe approach is also not feasible yet. An alternate design using the CRT to paint the red, green 
and blue pixel data for one scan axis (horizontal, the fast sweep axis) and using a galvanometer 
to provide vertical sweep has been devised. The best approach calls for a subminiature CRT 
with a triple-beam, inline electron gun to sweep adjacent, parallel, red, green and blue 
phosphor stripes simultaneously. These color scan lines would be optically overlaid and 
scanned vertically by a small galvanometer-driven mirrorto produce a complete image. Such 
a design offers low weight and employs current technology, so the design and implcmcniation 
cycle may be relatively short. The unique components of this design have been incompletely 
researched at this point and issues remain as to whether a sufficiently fast red phosphor and 
subminiature 3-beam gun can be easily obtained. A single beam design with fast green and 
blue (slower red) phosphors can be acquired in several month's time at low cost. Chapter 
three will address this approach again. 
3.4.1.7. LCD PANELS 

Considerable progress has been made on both monochrome and color LCD panels in recent 
yearx. Most development has been by Japanese manufacturers for commercial products, 
such as pocket-sized TVs or laptop computer display screens. Research at GE CR&D has 
produced a 6-inch, full color panel suitable for avionics use. LCDS offer exciting promise 
as on-helmet image sources, since they are small, thin, light weight, consume very little 
power and are reasonably durable. Pixels are arranged in rows and columns and image data 
are updated in sequence. Better thin film transistor, active matrix (TFTLCD) designs exhibit 
good grayscale rendering and reasonably fast switching speeds (40 to 25 ms), making ihem 
suitable for helmet video. Active matrix designs differ from cheaper row/column address types 
by having an active component (thin film FET pixel driver) at the intersection of each 
row/column address. The FET is coupled with a small capacitor voltage storage element which 
stores luminance values between refresh cycles. Better gray scale is also possible with this 
approach. Ovonic Imaging Systems currently leads U.S. efforts with an 8 X 8 inch, 1 ,296 by 
1,296 pixel active matrix, TFTLCD panel capable of color. 

Color is usually produced by placing a color mask under the front surface of the LCD panel 
so that color subpixel triads or quads form color in a manner analogous to the action of color 



42 



triads or stripes on a CRT. LCD panels can be iransmissive or rcflcciivc. More common 
transmissive design are iUuminated from the rear by diffuse sources. Addilional rcsoiulion and 
full color may be had by using three panels, separately illuminated with red, green and blue 
light, and combining the output using a combiner cube with dichroic filters. Kodak's LC-500 
video/computer projector employs such an approach successfully. 

Current resolution limits for small (Casio 5-inch diagonal) LCDs are 1.2 M addressable pixels 
per panel. Such panels exist commercially as units with color subpixcl quads, which limit 
resolution. If the color mask were removed and three units were combined with RGB rear 
illumination, good color and resolution would result. Size would be more of a problem for 
helmet mounting. A field sequential approach using switched color for rear illumination is 
possible, but LCD switching speeds are not currently fast enough to reduce color movement 
artifacts. 

Development areas exist for commercial color panels larger than 20 inches diagonal, which 
is the current state of the art. These larger panels are useful as product rcplaccmcnls for di rccOy 
viewed CRTs and as computer and HDTV displays. Military systems also use displays of this 
type for various systems, since the LCDs can be ruggedized. Commercial markets exist for 
very small color IF 1 LCDs (video camera viewer) with good resolution, but manufacturing 
problems exist which make successful designs difficult. First, it is desirable to have both high 
resolution and a large proportion ofthe screen consist of active pixel areas. This means that 
row/column address lines and interconnects must be very small. As these transparent 
conductors become thinner, their resistance increases and adjacent row or column "bleedovcr" 
or "crosstalk" becomes a considerable problem. Secondly, as the active display area becomes 
smaller and resolution is increased, then the row/column address circuitry must be added to 
the periphery ofthe display to reduce the number of interconnect lines to manageable levels. 
This increases the overall size of the display around the active area. 

The availabihty of small sized, high resolution LCD panels suitable for use as HMD color 
image sources is likely in the next five years and they will probably appear as low cost, 
commercial Japanese units. 

3.4.1^. ELECTRO-LUMINESCENT (EL) PANELS 

EL panels are less difficult to manufacture, have a higher production yield and cost less than 
LCD panels. They are being widely developed as an option or substitute for LCDs. They arc 
emissive, rather than reflective or transfiective, offer lower luminance and have shorter 
lifetimes than LCDs. EL panels used for rear illumination of LCD screens for laptop 
computers typically experience a 50 percent drop in luminance in about 1500 hours. They also 
require more power than LCDs, typically 15W for a 12-in. display panel. EL panels have 
under development for about a decade, some of the first being developed at Westinghou.se 
by T. R Btx)dy, who later spun off a new company to continue development. 

Efforts to design color panels are ongoing and show promise for release within the next five 
years. The development of small panels with sufficient resolution and luminance output to 
be used as on-helmet image sources for an HMD is not cunpenUy promising, as LCD designs 
can be rear illuminated to provide the required image brightness. 

3^. SCANNING PROCESSES SUITABLE FOR HMDS 

3^.1. ELECTROMAGNETIC/ELECTROSTATIC DEFLECTION 

Electromagnetic deflection is primarily used for CRT sweep deflection. Off-helmet video 
projectors which could be used to generate a complete image for transfer to the HMD by means 
of coherent fiber bundles would employ this process. GE light valves, in use with the CAE 
FOHMD system, acuially use electrostatic deflection for both sweep and luminance 



43 



modulation. Modulation occurs when the electron beam in the light valve swept lo cither side 
of its scan line position at RF rates (tens of megahertz), so as to create a diffraciion palllcm on 
an oil film whichcauses color luminance to escape the Schlieren bars in the light valve. Changes 
in electron beam intensity are only used for blanking. 

All on-helmet subminiature CRT HMD designs use electromagnetic dcflcclion lo generate 
a raster. The subminiature CRT is supplied with a confomial defleclion yoke, giving the lube 
with yoke a cylindrical format. The combination is quite successfully employed in a wide 
variety of monochrome HMD designs. The proposed color stripe subminiature CRT design 
with either a single or the three-beam inline electron gun would also use electromagnetic 
deflection. The single-gun approach would use an existing deflection and gun assembly, 
but horizontal sweep rates would be some three times that normally used. The inline gun may 
require that a yoke be tailored to properly drive three beams. The cost of subminiature CRTs 
are relatively low, on the order of one to several thousand dollars, which is a fraction of the cost 
of a typical visor optics system. Deflection systems are mature technology. 
3^.2. ACOUSTO-OPTIC DEFLECTION 

Acousto-optic deflection is suitable for deflecting laser beams in one axis at extremely fast (>30 
MHz) rates over small angles (< 5 degrees). Similar to the acousto-optic modulator (AOM), 
the device is optimized for specific wavelengths. It is suitable for use as a horizontal beam 
scanner in high line rate laser systems and can be used with galvanometer or faceted mirror 
scanners for vertical sweep to form a small complete raster image. It is small and light enough 
to be used on an HMD and requires little power, but color and image size issues remain. 

3^.3. GALVANOMETER MIRROR SCANNERS 

Galvanometer mirror scanners employ an open- or closed-loop galvanometer servo to 
position a small mirror to a commanded angle. Mechanical deflection angles may exceed 30 
degrees, in an optical deflection angle of twice that. These small, motor-like devices can 
deflect mirrors at rates up to several hundred hertz, but rates depend on the mirror/armature 
moments of inertia, the power of the galvo and drive levels. Faster galvanometer scanners are 
available as open-loop, torsional pendulum types. These devices may have beryllium 
mirrors, which have low inertial moments and are stiff enough to resist distortion at rates 
up to four kilohertz. These devices are resonant scanners, and if tuned lo drive waveform 
frequencies to within one-half percent, may be synchronized with the sweep waveform. They 
produce a sinusoidal sweep, and scan lines can be made reasonably linear if active video is 
produced over 85 percent of the angle (65 % of the wavefomn period). Under these conditions, 
pixel dwell times are approximately twice as short in the center than at each edge. 
A combination of a closed-loop scanner and a sinusoidal scannercan be used to scan a complete 
image if multiple scan lines are painted at once. Using eight simultaneous scan lines allows 
an interfaced, 1000-line image format to be produced using a four kilohertz resonant scanner 
in the horizontal axis and a linear, closed loop scanner running at 60 Hz vertically. A 
2000-line interlaced/1 000-line non-interiaced format is being set up which will paint scan 
lines in both directions. The active line count in the raster is only limited by the mechanical 
flyback and settling time of the linear vertical galvo. Further, if each laser beam is equally 
displaced vertically, vertical sweep angle requirements are reduced by a corresponding 
amount. This approach is used by the GE R&D system presented in this contract. The optical 
layout chosen permits small mirrors to be used, so both galvo units arc quite small 
(approximately 1X1X2 inches for each galvo), and are lightweight. 
3J.4. ROTATING POLYGON MIRROR SCANNERS 

Rotating polygon mirror scanners offer two primary advantages over galvanomctcr-typc 
(particulariy resonant-types) scanners for optical scanning at high rales. Specifically, sweep 

44 



angles are linear with time (notsinusiodal) and flyback, orretrace, times are usually much lower 
and depend only on the beam size with respect to the mirror facet size. Beams must be cut off 
where a portion ofthe beam falls on two adjacent facets. Novel approaches using two switched 
beams at slightly different feed angles allow this retrace time to be csseniialiy zero. But 
rotating polygon mirror scanners are only useful for optical scanning off-helmet. They are 
large, noisy, require compressed air for high speed bearings, exhibit excessive gyroscopic 
effects and have safety considerations (mirror wheel explosion) at the high rates employed (up 
to 35 000 RPM). They are in use in a number of laser scanned raster projection systems and 
NTS C 's VDRT system employs such a device to generate horizontal scan lines, which arc 
then transferred to the helmet via a coherent fiber strip for subsequent vcnical scanning via 
a galvanometer. Mirror wheels are expensive, requiring high precision mirror face 
manufacturing for equal vertical line spacing. Mirror wheel size and particularly weight and 
strength are crucial for high speed operation. Drive electronics must be stable to ensure stable 
synchronization. Precision ball bearings may be used at rates slightly above 20,000 RPM, but 
air bearings must be used above that. High speeds also cause windage losses and audible noise. 
Materials and manufacturing processes continue to improve, but electronic processes offer 
better promise in the next decade. 

3^.5 PIEZO MIRROR TECHNOLOGY 

Piezo mirrortechnology was examined for applicability and several sources were located, these 
devices are relatively simple, consisting of a tiiin slab of piezo material upon which electrodes 
have been plated on both sides. Deflection is accomplished by applying a voltage across the 
electrodes, which results in the slab bending. Mirror deflectors have been constructed using 
pairs ofthe deflectors operating out of phase and attached to opposite edges of the mirror. These 
devices were rejected for vertical deflection use due to the difficulty in obtaining a 
linear.,closed-loop stable response. Their use for the 4 kHz horizontal scanner was rejected for 
stability, mirror size, and deflection angle performance at the required speed. A suitable 
off-the-shelf device could not be located and galvonometer scanners with the required speed, 
small size, and linearity were chosen instead. 

3.6. HEAD TRACKING TECHNOLOGY 

HeadU-acking systems fall into three operating principle categories: electromagnetic, optical 
and ultrasonic. The most widely employed system is the Polhemus (now Kaiser) 3-Space 
system, which is electromagnetic in operation. This system employs a scn.sor-rcccivcr pair 
of modules, each consisting of a set of miniature coils, mounted orthogonally in three axes. One 
set, tiie transmitter, is mounted atop and to Uie rear of the helmet. The receiving coils are 
mounted on the cockpit structure behind tiie pilot. The transmitter coils are sent a sequence of 
pulses which vary in received amplitude according to the difference in angles in all axes 
between the transmitter and receiver coils modules. The system is specified to operate within 
a volume measuring 20 inches on a side. In practice, ranges beyond about 15 inches result in 
the recovered position signal having considerable RMS position noise. Current design efforts 
involve increasing tiie effective position data rates beyond the current 60 data points per 
second, so tiiat data filtering processes can be employed. Faster rates can be filtered more 
effectively, and position or rate predictionalgorithmscanbeused to reduce the transport delay 
in scene position responses to head movement. Some current systems (ISCAN) specify data 
output rates as high as 240 Hz at reduced accuracy. Current head position accuracy is on the 
order of one-half inch, and angles are one-half to one degree. Research continues lo improve 
data rates and accuracy. These systems have small, lightweight on-hclmct components and 
costs are approximately 20,000 dollars per system for the hardware. The trend for the next 
five years will be higher perfonmance (data rates and accuracy) and moderate cost increases. 



45 



r 



Acoustical systems (e.g.-A. E. Gaertner) operate by timing the arrival of acouslic pulses emitted 
from a series of emitters (spark gap) to a series of ultrasonic microphones mounicd on the 
cockpit structure. This is a relatively new technology, but the brassboard system under 
development is evolving as a 6-DOF, flight capable system which will be demonstrated to 
NTSCinFeb., 1990. The claimed accuracy is on the order of one arc-minuic with position 
accuracy of perhaps 1/10 in. Current data rates are 120 Hz, but 240 Hz is expected soon. Costs 
of the initial unit are in the $40-50,000 range. On-helmet components are lightweight and 
relatively small, and the system may show promise. Some digitizing tablets employ this 
technology. 

Several headtracking systems employing opUcal processes are in use. One of the 
best-performing systems is in use with CAE's FOHMD display. It uses a scries (6) of 
IR-emitting diodes mounted on a small "halo" ring atop the helmet. Each of these diodes is 
strobed in sequence and observed by four solid-state IR-sensitive video cameras mounted 
above on the cockpit strucUire. While each camera operates at a 60-Hz field rate, phasing the 
video synchronization to each camera results in data acquisition at a 240-Hz rale. Data must 
be position normalized prior to filtering and prediction processes. Accuracy is belter than with 
the electromagnetic systems, but it's components are larger and four cameras must be 
mounted so as not to obstruct the pilot's field of view. Costs are in the $15-20,000 range. This 
system is useful here if the raster generator system on the helmet docs not conflict with 
mounting position requirements for the IR-emitterring (the laser scanner docs, the color CRT 
approach does not). 

A recent Textron development, for which details are lacking, apparently employs a bi-axial 
optical detection device which is capable of resolving the offset of the centroid of a beam 
of light from the center of the sensor. The sensor has a pair of electrodes in both axes which 
provide resistance ratios measurable to one part in one million. Sample rates are expected to 
approach a kilohertz, but 1-300 Hz is more likely now. Accuracy is expected to be excellent 
with good weight and form factors required for on-helmet use. The brassboard system under 
development now has an accuracy limited by the 12-bit A/D in use. Costs are reported to be 
near $4-5,000. the sensor costing $1200. Several sizes of the sensor are available, the largest 
having an active area of 20 mm in diameter, but having lower sample rates. Textron currently 
uses the device for X-Y table positioning, but adaption for helmet use is possible, by adding 
a lens to each sensor and improved electronics. This system shows near-temi promise for 
further development. 

There are a number of other approaches, including scanning mirrorAR emitter trackers 
(obsolescent) and one video system which employs an eyetracker-type video camera to follow 
a black spot affixed to the subject's forehead which were reviewed, but arc not recommended 
for use here. 

3.7. VISOR SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY 

Of the possible helmet visor choices (Figure 3.7-1) two remain after wide field of view, full 
color correction and low distortion are factored in as requirements. Many catadioptric and 
mirror/beamsplitter systems are in use, but the recent advent of color-corrected holographic 
optical elements (HOE) for use in visor designs is the most promising current technology. A 
recenUy devised process by the Technology Innovation Group, Inc. allows the optical relay 
process from the raster image to be much more efficient than that of the Pancake Window 
(the other choice, in use with FOHMD), which suffers from both low ambient (about 8 percent) 
and optical throughput. Ambient throughput from this new device is expected to be as high 
as 60 percent, with optical throughput efficiencies better than half that. Full details are 
lacking, as the design has not been fuUy disclosed and portions of the manufacturing process 
for the ' HOE are being refined. It will consist of a pair of relay lenses, the HOE and a visor 



46 



optic element. The weight will depend on final lens design, but should noi differ much from 
current monochrome visors used with CRTs. The configuration will depend on the raster 
generator output images' format, but it expected that the laser scanner approach will require 
that the images be above and on the front of the helmet and relayed down to the visor. A design 
opportunity exists to examine whether the scanner and visor lens elements can be integrated 
to save size and weight Initial costs are very high, on the order of $200-250,000 for the first 
systems, which no doubt includes much non-recurring design and development costs. The 
80 degree FOV (per eye) Pancake Window units are also very expensive. The HOE visor shows 
the most promise in the next four to five years. The field-of-vicw requirements are 
challenging, however, and it remains to be seen whether an artifact-free image can be 
produced.

CHAPTER 4 
DESIGN APPROACH 



4.1. PURPOSE 



This chapter will serve to address the requirements forTask 3 as stated in the Staicmeni of Work 
(SOW). Summarily, Task 3 consists of the following five subtasks: 

-Derive two hardware approaches to meet the requirements derived in Task 1 .3. 

-Consider factors such as CRT, TFEL,light valve and fiber-optic technology; holographic and 
other optical techniques; optical or magnetic headtracking; oculometer and other cyetracking 
relevant technologies. 

-Identify development risks, expenditures of time and resources as well as capability trade-offs. 

-Present candidate approaches and a recommendation to LaRC for approval. 

The simultaneous requirements for full color, high resolution and wide field of view (FOV), 
combined with good ambient out-the- window (OTW) visibility limit the choice of existing 
HMD systems to zero. The closest performance of an existing system is CAE's FOHMD. 
Obviously, if the design were easy to do, there would be a number of choices avail able. But there 
aren't and the color requirement is the main culprit. The visor optics must be fully color 
corrected and wide FOV, which puts its design at the leading edge of technology. There arc no 
immediate choices for a small, lightweight color raster generator, either, since subminiaturc 
CRTs cannot display color in the usual manner with a shadow mask or grill . There arc promising 
new technologies, such as TFT-LCD color matrix panels, which offer small size, low power, 
light weight and other attractive attributes, but the required combination of small size and 
adequate resolution is not likely to be available in the next three to five years, although the trends 
are aU in the right direction. 

Figure 4. 1-1 depicts the area of design focus for a new approach to a color HMD. Figure 4.1-2 
depicts on overall block diagram of the HMD system required by NASA LaRC and is, in 
general, the block diagram of any HMD system. 

The block labeled "image generator" is the system which generates high resolution RGB color 
video data based on an observer's line of sight, altitude, time of day, etc. Normally, this data 
would be sent straight to displays for observation. The output of this system is two RG B channels 
of video data (for stereopsis) and synchronizing signals for the displays. 

The block labeled "video generator" is a video converter and is only required if the scan rates 
or image format is different than normal IG scan formats. Under such conditions, several scan 
lines or perhaps an entire field or frame of video will be stored and then read out at the rates 
required by the particular raster generator process chosen. It is a post processor and should have 
as little throughput delay as possible. 

The "heart" of a HMD design lies in the design of the raster generator which paints the image 
on the image plane required by the relay lens of the visor optics. The design of all other 
subsystems is driven by the configuration of the raster generator and the visor optic. Initial 
desiderata for a color raster generator design are depicted in Figure 4.1-3. Portions of the raster 
generator may reside on-helmet or off-helmet, depending on the process chosen. An example 
of an off-helmet process is the CAE FOHMD design, in which complete images from four light 
valve projectors, located off-helmet, are sent to the helmet via coherent fiber optic bundles in 
order to provide a useful image to the crewman. A typical on-hclmet raster generator example 
is any monochrome subminiature CRT HMD, which only requires that video and dcficction 
signals be sent to the helmet. Other examples of mixed designs were discussed in chapter two 
and depicted by the raster generator taxonomy matrix.

A suitable color image must be in the correct form and position for use by a visor optic 
subsystem. Of the catadioptric, mirror/beamsplitter, "pancake window" and holographic visor 
processes reviewed, only the very recently devised (details are still not public) holographic visor 
optic has the expected performance to meet the required color correction and field of view 
specified. The "pancake window" used by CAE's FOHMD is a fall-back choice, bui lacks 
ambient visibility, is optically very inefficient and may not fully meet field of view requirements. 
The visor must have provisions for focus, interocular distance and pupil ccniroid location 
adjustment to fit 5th through 95th male pilot anthropometric data. Additional adjustments must 
exist to peimit varying scene overlap to each eye from zero to 40 degrees and for raster 
alignment 

The hehnet shell itself should be lightweight, fit a wide variety of head sizes and be adjustable 
for snug fit to prevent the scene being displaced with nonmal head movement (Figure 4.1-^). 
Infiatable air bladders or selectable pads are the usual method of adjusting the helmet fit. The 
helmet also serves as the mount for the visor optic subsystem, the on-helmet portion of the raster 
generator, the umbilical and provides mounts for the communications microphonc/hcadscl and 
headtracking transmitter. All of this hardware must have a weight of five pounds or less and have 
a composite center-of-gravity close to that of the head alone, as a design goal. 

Three choices were ultimately devised. Two of the three were recommended (Figure 4.1-5) the 
first based upon a subminiature CRT with mixed electronic and mechanical sweep; a second 
using ongoing GE R&D involving a laser scanned system; and a third employing an obvious 
long-range TFT-LCD approach. 

4.1.1. THE SUBMINIATURE COLOR CRT APPROACH 

The subminiature color CRT approach was devised in an effon to "work around" the fact that 
nonmal color CRT approaches of using a shadow mask or grill cannot be applied to a 
subminiature tube because the extremely small and dense spacing required for mask elements 
and phosphor triads exceed the capabilities of any current manufacturing technology. You'd 
have to accurately deposit color phosphors a grain at a time. Using three CRTs (one red, one 
green, one blue) per side is too heavy, but would have the required performance. A single tube, 
indexed-beam approach won't work, either, due to the stripe density required for the stated 
resolution. 

One approach is to use the good factors of a subminiature CRT (high electronic sweep rates, 
good resolution with a continuous phosphor) to provide the scan line generation process and use 
a galvanometer scanner to provide a linear vertical sweep needed to make a complete raster, a 
task to which it is perfectly suited. Three contiguous, parallel stripes of red, green and blue 
phosphor can be swept by individual electron beams using the usual electromagnetic deflection 
process. Phosphor decay times would have to be shorter than the horizontal line's sweep time. 
Since the RGB components of a color scan line are displaced vertically, they must be 
simultaneously combined optically or video data delays can be introduced for two of the three 
colors to provide contiguity and overiap when the raster is scanned venically. A delay of N 
multiple scan lines can easily be provided by the use of line buffers in the video generator The 
number of active scan lines per frame is reduced by the delay line factor, since scan lines at the 
very top and bottom of the raster would have incomplete color information during the delay 
time.

Since scan lines will repeat their position on the phosphor's surface with each horizoniai sweep, 
the phosphor could easily be burned. One way to improve phosphor life is lo use an asymmeiric 
scanning spot which is "stretched" vertically, so as to spread the electron beam's energy over 
a larger area of each phosphor stripe. The asymmetric spot shape can then be made smaller and 
symmetrical by means of an anamorphic, or "strip" lens, which has optical power in only one 
axis. This makes the RGB spots symmetrical and brings them closer together at the focal point, 
so lower video delays are involved. Color phosphors for green and blue with the required short 
decay times and luminous efficiency have been identified as types T45 and T46. One possible 
candidate for the companion red phosphor has recently been identified. Some 20 years ago, 
Westinghouse experimented with a calcium sulphode phosphor which exhibited most of the 
properties required here. The phosphor was not registered and is no longer available from 
Westinghouse. There is one probable Japanese source: Mitsui 's Mining and Smelting Central 
Research Labs, in Ageo, Saitani Prefecture, Japan. 

The vertical galvanometer scanner would sweep the scan lines vertically to produce a complete 
raster at the required image plane for the visor. Normal sweep rates are required, but multi-line 
video buffers must be used for two of the colors to provide the correct superimposition of RGB 
data to form a complete color scan line at the raster plane. Since the phosphors are continuous, 
horizontal resolution is only limited by electron beam spot size. Vertical resolution is a function 
of spot shape, determined by the anamorphic lens. Ideally, the spot shape will be symmetrical 
at the focal plane, thus vertical resolution (active line count) will be similar lo the pixel pilch. 
This concept has been patented (pending) as a joint GE/NASA LaRC concept for this contract. 
Figure 4.1.1-1 and depicts the subminiature color CRT concept for a raster generator. 
The optimum subminiature color CRT approach calls for a triple-beam, inline electron gun. 
Such designs exist for small color CRTs. The use of three simultaneous beams improves overall 
display luminance, compared to a single-beam gun, and sweep and video buffering processes 
are simplified. An initial search was conducted by telephone to a number of CRT specialty 
houses (in the U.S.), but a source for an inline gun of sufficiendy small size has not been located 
as yet. Thomas Electronics indicated that a 15mm gun is required, but a 1 9mm gun is the smallest 
located thus far. A Japanese source (periiaps Sony) may be possible. An interim solution is to 
use a single-beam gun (available from Thomas Electronics and others) and to sweep all three 
stripes in sequence. For a l(XX)-line raster format, this forces horizontal sweep rates lo be 
beyond 90 kHz, video bandwidths (and video buffer speeds) to go up by a factor of three. Dwell 
time per pixel is similariy reduced, providing lower luminance. This is nol an optimum design, 
but may enable initial testing to be done while a triple-beam gun is being located or devised. 
Another possibility is to use a slightly larger CRT with a 19mm inline gun. A subminiature CRT 
with color stripes and single-beam gun can be fabricated is less than two months at a cost of 
2-3,(XX) dollars. The single-beam alternative approach is depicted in Figure 4.1.1-2.

A video generator is required to buffer the data for two adjacent colors by the number of line 
times it takes for the vertical scanner to translate the third color to a point where the other two 
overlap optically. In other words, the red phosphor may be painting video for the current line 
from the IG, while the adjacent green will be painting video data one or two lines old, depending 
on the optical displacement, as measured in scan lines. Buffer rates with the three gun approach 
are on the order of 30 MHz and are typical rates for current hardware. The single gun approach 
will require a buffer some three times faster, which will require careful design, but is not 
excessive. Synchronizing pulse speeds are unchanged. 

It is believed that this approach may be easily applied to an existing NASA LaRC HMD design 
which has subminiature CRTs and color corrected visor optics. The vertical scan mirror would 
simply replace an existing fold mirror in the optical path ft-om the CRT to the visor and the new 
CRT and yoke assembly would replace the existing monochrome assembly. 

4.1.2. THE GE IR&D LASER SCANNER HMD SYSTEM 

Research has been ongoing at GE SCSD for over two years on a laser scanned approach for a 
color raster generator which paints eight full color scan lines simultaneously. This approach 
exploits several unique features which enable a high resolution raster to be generated on-helmet. 

The use of eight simultaneous scan lines permits lOOO-line raster formats to be generated with 
a horizontal sweep rate of only 4 kHz. The 4 kHz rate, in turn, enables the use of small 
galvanometer mirror scanners for horizontal deflection, a linear galvanometer scanner is used 
to provide the vertical sweep required to paint a complete raster image. The horizontal scanner 
is a torsional pendulum type and exhibits sine-wave oscillation. Only 85 percent of the scan 
angle in one direction is used to paint video (34 percent of one full cycle time), resulting in a 
reasonably linear scan line format with only very slight droop at the edges prior to horizontal 
scanner scan direction reversal. Maximum video bandwidth requirements are reduced to less 
than 14 MHz for the 1000-line, 1000 pixel format, but for evenly spaced pixels along a line, the 
dwell time per pixel in the center of the raster line is half that for a pixel at each end of the line, 
due to velocity changes in the sine-wave sweep. 

A set of simultaneous design requirements had to be solved in choosing the lenses, the scanners, 
the fibers and the overall layout. The raster image size (19mm diagonal, 3:4 format) was fixed 
by the initial visor chosen. It is the size of a typical subminiature CRT's format. For a 1000 by 
lOCX) pixel raster, the resulting spot size is 11.4 by 15.2 microns. A fiber was chosen with a 9 
micron core to allow for diffraction limits of the lenses. The use of two lenses to form a 1 : 1 
telephoto path was chosen to provide coUimated pixel luminance between the lenses. The 
numerical aperture of the fibers, combined with the focal length of the lens was chosen to 
provide collimated pixel beams of 8 to 10 mm, which was limited by the size of the horizontal 
scan mirror (16mm), since the mirror would be displaced slightly from the beam convergence 
point. The fiber chosen has the required 9 micron core size and a NA of 0. 1 , which provides a 
10mm beam at the 50mm focal length of the lens. The scan angles required to paint the raster 
image's size dictated the f-number and the focal length of the lens. A high quality off-the-shelf 
50mm, f 1 : 1 .2 lens for a 35mm SLR camera was chosen for the design. The initial set of fibers 
was cemented in a test fixture which formed the input pixel plane for the system. Fiber spacing 
and alignment was imprecise and the resulting image did not exhibit contiguous sectors. The 
latest fiber set has provisions for minor adjustment of the ends of the fibers. A single off-board 
laser with modulator was used to provide test pattern luminance for all eight fibers. Three more 
lasers have been acquired to form a brighter, more complete raster image. The block diagram 
for the overall laser scanned system is depicted in Figure 4.1.2-1.

By displacing the ends of the optical fibers which form a vertical array of eight beams and 
angling the beams outward systematically before entering the lens, collimated beams are formed 
which cross at the center of the path between the two lenses. The lens pair forms a 1 : 1 telephoto 
relay with image planes at the focal plane at the outer end of the each lens. This crossover point 
is where both scan mirror planes are located and represents the smallest optical "footprint" of 
the image's pixel data. Sm^ scan mirrors can thus be used. Further, equally displacing the fibers 
reduces the vertical deflection angle requirements by a factor of eight and linearity can be 
achieved more easily. Deflection must use collimated beams in order to form a flat raster plane 
at the focal plane of the output lens. The current two lens configuration is symmetrical, with 
image luminance passing through the lens pairs in opposite directions for the left and right 
rasters, each lens thus acts as an input and an output lens, providing considerable size and weight 
reductions over the earlier approach which consisted of four lenses arranged as an "X". The new 
configuration simply folds the "X" in the middle, producing a "V" optical path. With both 
scanners operating on luminance for each eye simultaneously, scene stability and registration 
is ensured. 

It is hoped that a 2CXX)-line (interlaced) or 1000-line (non-interlaced) can be demonstrated next 
using active scanning during both directions of the horizontal sweep. Currently, the 4 kHz 
scanner, being a torsional pendulum type, produces a sine-wave horizontal sweep. Only some 
85 percent of a half cycle (34 percent of a one-cycle period) is allocated for active pixel 
production. At 85 percent of the scan angle, the scan lines exhibit minimum curving upward and 
downward at the outer edges, prior to the scanner reversing direction. A plan to add an 
empirically derived, 8 kHz waveform to the vertical scanner driver will allow the vertical 
scanner to straighten out the less than two arc-minutes of residual curvature in the raster This 
will allow scan lines to be painted in the reverse direction, resulting in a 20(X)-line (interfaced) 
format. The vertical scanner is a closed-loop type, producing a linear sawtoothed vertical sweep. 
Finite vertical flyback times currently limit the 1000-line raster format to about 850 active 
displayed lines, but a faster scanner has been procured and will be tested for reduced flyback 
times and response at 8 kHz. The previous scaimer's tested bandwidth was limited to 3800 Hz. 

The raster is a 15mm diagonal, 3:4 format suitable for input to the visor optic subsystem. This 
real image is painted on a super high resolution rear projection screen with a gain of 1.5 to 2 
f-stops. This provides some measure of laser safety and increases the exit pupil size. Additional 
safety is planned by having the lasers cut off in the event of sweep failure. The optical fiber core, 
which is imaged through the lens system, is only nine microns in size. Diffraction limits for the 
lens are computed to be approximately five microns. The spot size is expected to be about 12 
microns when focused. The currenUy used breadboard configuration is depicted in Figure 
4. 1 .2-2, as is a schematic of the unfolded optical path demonstrating the eight splayed, displaced 
pixel beams. 

The fundamental approach allocates all heavy, bulky components off-helmet. Lasers and 
modulators are off-helmet and power levels may easily be scaled to provide any display 
luminance desired. The umbilical to the helmet is small, consisting only of 1 6 optical fibers and 
the galvanometer and headtracker leads. The use of off-helmet lasers provides sufficient display 
luminance, contrast and a full color gamut. Ort-helmet scanner components are small and have 
been shown to produce a stable raster with no speckle. An improved two-lens optical 
arrangement should reduce weight and bulk considerably over the earlier design employing four 
lenses. At this juncture, a 1000-line raster (850 active lines) has been demonstrated, but with 
imperfect fiber alignment

The visor of choice for this system is in development by the Technology Innovation Group, Inc. 
Details are not fully released at this point in time. The raster generator will be mounted atop the 
helmet, toward the front, and feed the visor from above. A design opportunity exists to examine 
the total optical requirements for the raster generators and the input relay lens of the visor, so 
that additional weight and size reductions can be identified for the visor plus raster generator 
as a system. 

4.1.3. THE TFT-LCD APPROACH 

A TFT-LCD approach employing active matrix liquid crystal panels was devised and presented 
to NASA LaRC. These devices offer the promise of light weight, small size, low cost and power 
requirements. They are also robust. The TFT-LCD approach is currently in widespread 
development, both as large colorpanels suitable for HDTV and "laptop" compulerdisplays, and 
as small panels suitable for miniature TV use. Most of the development is being done by the 
Japanese for commercial applications, although GE CR&D has developed a lOOO-line color 
display for aircraft instrument use. The projected approach would have employed a cube of three 
panels to produce full color at high resolution in a manner similar to video projector designs 
currently maiiceted by Sharp and Kodak (LC500). Panels with the required small size and pixel 
density are not currently available. 

The primary development problem of very small, high density Thin-Film-Transisior (TFT), 
active matrix LCDs is one of manufacturing and materials technology. For a one inch diagonal 
display with 1024 lines and 1280 pixels, the row/column address lines, which consist of 
transparent conductive material, exhibit sufficient resistance that crosstalk and address speed 
effects arise. The active areas of for effective mask alignment tolerances during production. A 
high proportion of active area is desirable to improve contrast and to reduce the visibility of the 
residual structure. Switching speeds are a function of spacing between the panels, and present 
limits seem to be about 25 ms. 

Interconnect issues also exist for any LCD and are worse for miniature units in the sense thai 
Uie area required for decode logic is large compared to die active screen size, the best solution 
is to incorporate tiie row/column address drivers on the LCD substrate, so that far fewer 
interconnects are required between the LCD and video conu-oUer These inactive areas on the 
periphery of the display can influence the configuration of multipanel displays, as are used for 
RGB color. 

The small display size required for HMD use suggest three possible configurations. One choice 
would be to use a rear illumination of red, green, and blue in a field-sequential manner Only 
one LCD panel per eye would be required and either RGB LED or laser sources or fiber optic 
sources could be used to provide rear illumination of die panel. Switching speeds of the panel 
have to be faster than is currenUy available, and some color fringe artifacts will be noted with 
scene translation due to head movement. 

A second choice is to use three panels and a combiner cube, each panel having it's own red, 
green, or blue rear illumination. Such units are currently used by Kodak and Epson in video 
projection units. Current commercial resolutions are 320 pixels by 200 lines and grid structure 
between pixels is noticed, but color rendition is good and lag is not noticeable. Projectors with 
increased resolution (up to 640 x 480) are under development. 

A tiiird choice of using one panel with color subpixels is possible at reduced resolution, such 
panels are in wide use by Sharp and other Japanese manufacturers of miniature TV and VCR 
units. NASA JSC has one inexpensive HMD which utilizes two of these panels and the 
resolution is sufficient for the limited research they plan to conduct with it. Figures 4. 1 .3-1 and 
4.1.3-2 hst the LCD approach and development risks.

NASA LaRC rejected the LCD approach, since the time frame for the development of panels 
with both smaU size and suitable pixel density is unlikely in the next four to five years. Efforts 
to spur development by the Japanese for limited markets has also resulted in limited success. The 
TFT-LCD approach will not be elaborated upon further in this document. 

4.2. DEVELOPMENT RISK AREAS 

4.2.1. SUBMINIATURE COLOR CRT APPROACH 

The subminiature color CRT approach has two primary areas of risk associated with full 
implementation as initially devised. These are the choice of a suitable red phosphor and the 
choice of a three-beam inline electron gun with appropriate characteristics. Fallback choices for 
each areas exist. While the ultimate performance of the CRT system is not expected to be as good 
as the 2000-line laser scanned system, it has the advantage of being implemented more quickly 
and will probably easily adapt to existing visor and HMD designs which currently employ color 
corrected optics and subminiature CRTs. 

The three-beam gun was specified because it offers higher display brighmess, since three 
simultaneous beams emit more energy than a single beam which must be swept sequentially 
across the three color stripes. In addition, the design of the video line buffer and horizontal 
deflection circuits are simplified for the three-gun approach, since video data output rates and 
deflection rates are lower by a factor of three. The use of an inline gun, rather than the "delta" 
configuration should reduce the size and complexity of the deflection yoke and driving circuits. 

Single beam electron guns are readily available at low cost which have the spot size and 
deflection characteristics which are required. Three beam, inline guns are in wide use in standard 
color CRTs which employ a shadow mask or grill. Very small (9-in. diagonal) color CRTs may 
employ guns which are 19mm in size. Such guns could easily be grafted to the subminiature 
CRT's envelope, but the performance of such an arrangement has never been tested. Issues 
identified involve focus range, resulting spot size, deflection linearity and the general behavior 
of the electron beam between the gun and the phosphor surface. Very little commercial CRT 
development is currently being done in the U.S. at this time. Zenith being an exception. The 
Japanese produce the majority of new color CRT designs, and Sony is a leader in the inline gun 
area. 



66 



One approach to reducing the risk of obtaining a suitable, 15mm inline gun is to graft the smaUest 
commercially available (19mm) gun onto a slightly larger subminiature CRT's envelope with 
the three-stripe color phosphor and test it's performance. If the resulting performance is 
acceptable, the resulting weight and size increase would be minor compared to the benefits 
afforded by beginning research using a full-color system much earlier than would be possible 
with the laser scanned system. 

Suitable green and blue phosphors for the three-stripe color approach have been identified as 
T45 and T46 types. Persistence times of 250 to 350 microseconds are desirable, since these are 
on the order of one line's sweep time. Bum resistance is also an important parameter, since line 
sweeps will occur on the same path as the previous line. One red phosphor has been identified 
(Thomas Electronics) which has the required decay time, but it's luminous efficiency is about 
10 percent of the green and blue. The application of the phosphors as three parallel, contiguous 
stripes is not a problem, according to Thomas Electronics officials, who indicated that a 
subminiature CRT/yoke assembly with a single-beam gim with the required color stripes could 
be delivered in 4-8 weeks at a cost of 2-30(X) dollars. 

A detailed design of the subminiature CRT process has not been done. Such an effort would also 
address the choice and placement of the anamorphic lens, considering the input image plane 
requi rements for the vi sor system , the spacing of the color stripes and the height of the asli gm atic 
scanning spots. 

The visor system's vendor has been identified and an approach has been chosen to provide the 
field-of-view and color correction necessary to meet specifications. Such a visor has not been 
produced, and questions remain as to whether one holographic optical element or two will be 
required for each eye. If two are required, due to the wide field of view and color ranges 
specified, then a slight, out-of-focus vertical edge may be discemable in the displayed image. 
The design of the visor system has been estimated to be from six months to one year. Fabrication 
will require a similar time frame. The holographic optical element's design will depend on the 
wavelengths and bandwidth of the phosphors or lasers chosen. These characteristics will differ 
for the CRT's phosphor and the laser, and must be included in the design of the holographic film. 
This risk factor is common to both the CRT and laser scanned approaches. 

A color-corrected visor with a slightly reduced field-of-view has recently been produced for 
use by NASA LaRC. It is curently a monochrome stereoscopic HMD. 

4^.2. LASER SCANNED APPROACH RISK FACTORS 

The laser scanned approach has the probable payoff of producing a full color image with a wider 
range and more saturated colors, higher resolution and higher display luminance. Risk areas 
involve image quality, since the image will be composed of eight juxtaposed sectors which must 
be carefully aligned and which require good vertical scanner linearity; speckle effects, resulting 
from the use of coherent laser light must be minimized, but these were not observed for the red 
test image, even at high luminance levels; and the overall configuration and resulting weight and 
CG of the raster generator and visor assembly when integrated on the helmet. 

Initial research efforts have primarily addressed the design of the raster generator. It is believed 
that the design of the video generator (post processor) required to convert normal image 
generator data and scan rates to an eight simultaneous line format required by the scanner is 
relatively straight-forward. Variable output pixel timing, required to linearize pixel sizes along 
a scan line is also not a problem. Transport delays should be one field time, worst case, and will 
depend on the hardware design chosen. 

Scanner galvanometers are off-the-shelf items, but the full 2000-line (interfaced) or 1 0(X>-line 
(non-interfaced) format has yet to be demonstrated. A faster vertical scanner has been 
implemented and it is hoped that it will exhibit the required two arc-minute response at an eight 



67 



kHz rate necessary to permit bi-directional raster scanning. This approach will double both the 
resolution and the scene luminance available from the display. 

4.3. HMD DESIGN APPROACH SUMMARY 

Three design approaches for generating high resolution and full color were identified as possible 
candidates for development and were presented to NASA LaRC for approval. Much of the 
design effort focused on the raster generator portion of the HMD, since ^e unique part of the 
development effort was the requirement for full color capability. The laser scanned approach 
was chosen for further definition and development. A Envelopment Plan (Appendix A) and 
Design Specification (Appendix B) were prepared and constitute the latter part of this document. 
Specifications for the Subminiature Color CRT approach were delivered to NASA LaRC under 
a separate contract extension. 

Summary and Conclusions 

This study produced a development plan and design spyecifications for a full color, high 
resolution, wide field of view HMD suitable for use in a research environment and suitable for 
further development into flight rated hardware. The selected laser scanned approach was based 
upon an concept which has been under development at GE/SCSD. Two novel approaches which 
relate to the laser scanner and a color subminiature CRT concept have been reported to NASA 
LaRC under this contract. 

The task-related requirements analysis only confirms what is already known: pilots want full 
eye-limited field of view and resolution capability in a fuU color HMD. In fact, there are 
relatively few tasks which demand this capability. In reality, rotorcraft pilots often make do with 
far less capability and compensate by altering their normal scanning behavior. This approach 
does have safety consequences, as NVG-related accident reports can attest to. The requirements 
stated for the HMD which are pertinent to a research setting press the current limits of 
technology and are more than adequate to investigate the benefits of color used with various 
system information formats. 

The technology survey represents a snapshot of technology which is in a constant state of 
evolution. The taxonomy matrix depicted in this report provides a meaningful format against 
which the operation of current HMD systems may be categorized and also provides a framework 
by which the expected benefits of the application of emerging areas of technology may be 
assessed when they are allocated to on- and off-helmet portions of the raster generator 
subsystem. This baseline should aid future design investigations in this area. 

A total of three design approaches were presented to NASA LaRC. LCD panels were presented 
as one approach, as they promise light weight, small size and low power, but the technology is 
not sufficiently mature to offer small size, high resolution and low interconnect density yet. The 
subminiature color CRT approach offers quick implementation to an existing NASA LaRC 
HMD design with color corrected optics which is in the last stages of construction. The 
performance of the CRT is expected to be somewhat lower in resolution than that promised by 
the laser scanner system, particularly if the 2000-line laser format is realized.The design 
approaches presented should allow NASA LaRC to proceed toward both near- and longer-term 
solutions for full color, high performance HMDs for rotorcraft research.

LASER SCANNER 
HELMET-MOUNTED DISPLAY 



APRIL 13, 1990 



NASA-LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER 

HAMPTON, VA 

23665-5225 



1.0 SCOPE 

This development plan is for a generic solution to the Laser Scaruied Helmet Mounted Display 
(LS/HMD). The plan discusses a range of possible LS/HMD configurations and subsystem 
components and the probable system and subsystem development risks. In addition, a list of 
analyses and critical tests which should be performed by the LS/HMD contractor to verify 
concept feasibility and performance verification is provided including a rough estimate of costs 
and recommended program scheduling and phasing. The recommended phasing for specific 
subsystems is designed to minimize the overall program risk and costs by proving the most 
critical elements of the LS/HMD first and evolving the prototype design from a proven base of 
knowledge. It is recommended that there be close liaison between the customer (NASA) and the 
contractor during the development of the LS/HMD in order that alternatives and technical 
decisions will lead to an optimum configuration which in addition satisfies the specification 
requirements. This development plan should be read in conjunction with the LS/HMD 
specification as it does not attempt to duplicate the basic requirements and background 
information. 

2.0 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 

The following documents form a part of this development plan to tiie extent staled herein, a. 
Specification for a Laser Scanner Hebnet Mounted Display dated April 13, 1990. 

3.0 SYSTEM DESIGN 

System engineering methodology, including appropriate trade-off analyses, is recommended in 
order to achieve the specified (Specification - Laser Scanner Helmet Mounted Display) 
performance and recommended schedule for the development of the LS/HMD at minimum cost. 

3.1 DEVELOPMENT PHASING 

A tiiree-phase plan is recommended for the development of the LS/HMD as follows: 

a. Phase I - Phase I should consist of all of the system analyses and detail design of the 
overall system. 

b. Phase II - Phase II should consist of tiie procurement, fabrication and testing of both the 

raster generator and visor subsystems. 

c. Phase III - Phase III should consist of the procurement, fabrication and testing of tiie 
remainder of the subsystems and the integration and testing of the LS/HMD system. 

Such a three phase plan will afford NASA the opportunity for incremental funding, if it so 
chooses, in Uiree separate fiscal years in addition to minimizing tiie overall technical risk of tiie 
LS/HMD development (e.g., tiie most critical subsystems can be proven prior to Phase III). 



A-1 



3.1.1 PHASE I ANALYSES AND DESIGN SEQUENCE 

The recommended analyses and design sequence within the phase I is as follows: 

a. Overall Design 

1 . Select raster generator design, analyze displayed raster performance 

2. Apportion components to on-helmet and off-4ielmet locations 

b. OfT-helmet components 

1. Select and layout off-helmet components, identify and solve component 
performance required and design overall adjustment and alignment scheme. 

2. Assess video modulation level, gamma conversion and distortion correction 
requirements. Identify video and scan driver electronics. 

c. On-helmet components 

1. Analyze color raster generation method construct timing diagrams of the 
scanning method conduct raytrace verification of optics verify image input 
requirements for the visor, verify perfomiance of all critical components. 

2. Design mounts, verify overall HMD configuration, analyze helmet weight, CG 
and inertia. 

3.1.2 PHASE n PROCUREMENT, FABRICATION AND TESTING SEQUENCE 

The recommended procurement, fabrication and testing sequence within phase II is as follows: 

a. Procurement - It is recommended that the raster generator and visor subsystems be 
procured only after joint approval of the two subsystem designs. An optimum design 
from the point of view of both maximum performance and minimum weight will dictate 
that the two subsystems be designed joinfly. This will necessitate that a full design 
disclosure will be required between each subsystem contractor if different. The 
procurement of either of these subsystems alone without the benefit of a joint design 
development may result in a reduced overall system perfomiance or a helmet weight 
penalty. 

b. Fabrication - No special sequence is recommended during the fabrication of the raster 
generator and visor subsystems. 

c. Testing - It is recommended that both subsystem and integrated subsystem tests be 
performed for the raster generator and visor subsystems. This will enable the 
verification of the critical static display performances. Such data will be useful in 
verifying that the specified performance of all other (Fliase III) subsystems is sufficient 
to optimally combine with these two subsystems. In regards to the helmet, the helmet 
contractor must know where the required attachment points are to be located if the 
helmet is to be designed for minimum weight Otherwise the helmet must be designed 



A-2 



for a range of attachment point locations which implies a strengthened area rather than a 
strengthened point location which in turn translates into an increased helmet weight 
design. 

3.1.3 PHASE m PROCUREMENT, FABRICATION AND TESTING SEQUENCE 

The recommended procurement, fabrication and testing sequence within phase III is as follows: 

a. Procurement - No special recommendations are made with regards to the phase III 
procurement. 

b. Fabrication - No special recommendations are made with regards to the phase III 
fabrication. 

c. Testing - It is recommended that an Government-Specified Graphics Generator 
workstation be made available to the prime contractor for in-plant tests in order that the 
entire LS/HMD can be integrated and tested. In this regards, an alternative to a 
Government loaned IRIS woricstation will be its lease or purchase as part of the contract. 
However, if the system design reveals and the Government approves a modification to 
the IRIS in order to improve system performance (e.g., minimum transport delay, etc.) 
then such modifications should, of course, be done on appropriate equipment or IRIS 
modules which will be furnished as part of the LS/HMD program. 

3.1.4 FUNCTIONAL DESIGN 

The LS/HMD when integrated with two Silicon Graphics 3D work stations 
(Government-Specified) Graphics Generator shall be capable of displaying variable 
perforaiance including real-time full color stereopsis imagery utilizing two instantaneous 
overlapping views. The Government-Specified Graphics Generator imagery shall be 
controlled in direction of view by closed loop command inputs from a tracking radiator attached 
to the observer's helmet and a proximity sensor. The LS/HMD baseline system is divided into 
six (6) major subsystems which collectively contain the basic elements necessary to provide the 
required functional capability. It should be noted that any specific LS/HMD configuration could 
deviate somewhat from that shown in terms of locating a specific hardware function in a 
different subsystem. For instance, the full color raster could be generated within either 
off-helmet or on-helmet subsystem hardware. 

The six subsystems comprising the baseline LS/HMD is shown in Figure 3. 1 .4-1 . Each of the 
subsystem descriptions includes (1) the assumed component/functions, (2) the analyses 
required, (3) a discussion of the development risks, (4) a discussion of the critical testing 
required and (5) the estimated cost, where low cost is approximately $50K to 1(X)K, medium = 
SIOOK to 250k and high cost is greater than $250K.

3^ TRADE-OFF ANALYSES 

The design and trade-off study phase should address the known development risks which will 
provide support for all required subsystem procurement specifications. The trade-off analyses 
relative to the proposed system and subsystem designs should provide: 

a. Alternative designs with resulting theoretical system and subsystem performance to 
assure that the proposed design is the correct and optimum choice 

b. Specification compliance of the proposed design, and 



A-4 



c. Detail design descriptions with block and signal flow diagrams, functional descriptions, 
component/subsystem performance and so forth. 

All trade-off analyses should be presented to NASA for approval at the Preliminary Design 
Review (PDR) and simimarized at the Critical Design Review (CDR) for final approval prior to 
the procurement of any hardware. The critical issues of overall system performance and 
technical risk should be thoroughly reviewed prior to design freeze. 
32.1 PERFORMANCE ANALYSES 

The most critical analyses issues relative to system performance are the displayed image quality 
and the size, weight and inertia of the operational helmet mounted display. Any trade-off of 
these parameters should be done with the full knowledge and approval of NASA. 

32.1.1 DISPLAYED IMAGE QUALITY 

The proposed design should be capable of producing a displayed image whose quality reflects 
the specified performance for all display parameters. It should be noted that the performance of 
the Government-Specified Graphics Generatormay introduce some image quality degradation 
which should be identified for purposes of judging the image quality of the LS/HMD. AU 
competing designs should be analyzed relative to each of the following critical display 
parameters. 

a. Resolution - The display resolution, especially within the stereopsis region, should be 
maintained over the full range of luminance and head motions. 

b. Luminance - The display luminance should be easily controlled for the various 
simulated time of day and external (to the visor) scene luminance. 

c. Field-of-vlew - The display field-of-view, especially within the stereopsis region, 
should not be traded off with any other display performance. It is desirable to achieve a 
HMD design which can significantly exceed the specified field-of-view in both the 
stereopsis and extended 2D regions. 

d. Full color - It is desirable that the quality of the displayed image for each of the three 
primary colors should be comparable over the full range of luminance and head 
motions. 

e. See through capability - The see through capability of the display should not degrade 
the quality of the displayed image. 

f. Headmotion - Itisdesirablethatheadmotionnotdegradetheoverallimagequalityor 
introduce any HMD artifacts. An analysis of the effects of head motion on image quality 
should be made for each specified mode of operation. 

3.2.1.2 SUBSYSTEM ANALYSES 

Each of the subsystems comprising the LS/HMD should be analyzed in terms of (1) their 
functions, (2) their interface with other subsystems, (3) the performance required to meet the 
subsystem specification and (4) their impact on achieving the overall system performance 
including the required displayed image quality. 



A-5 



3 J.2 TECHNICAL RISK ASSESSMENT 

The proposed design should assess the technical risk associated with achieving each specified 
performance. In addition, all alternative designs should desirably establish the technical risk 
associated with achieving the specified overall performance. Table 3.2.2-1 provides a technical 
risk assessment for each of the critical hardware and associated interfaces relative to each of the 
major subsystems for the generic LS/HMD. It should be noted that all of the LS/HMD system 
and subsystem specific design concepts will have many, if not all, of the same key technology 
development risks. 

3J2.3 TECHNICAL RISK REDUCTION 

The proposed design should implement a technical risk reduction plan for each of the 
subsystems. For instance, the risk of developing an effective raster generator design may be 
reduced by sequencing the development to address known high risk areas in the design. For the 
raster generator, these areas are primarily choosing a color image generation process which 
permits locating the light weight, small sized components on the helmet and any large, heavy or 
heat producing components off-hehnet. The resulting design approach should permit high 
resolution, high luminance and an artifact-free, stable raster of high image quality to be 
displayed. Image quality issues are of relatively high risk, since CRT systems may not produce 
the required resolution and mechanically scanned designs are more likely to have artifacts in the 
displayed raster. 

4.0 FUNCTIONAL DESIGN 

The six subsystems comprising the baseline LS/HMD is shown in Figure 3.1 .4-1 . Each of the 
subsystem descriptions includes (1) the assumed component/functions, (2) the analyses 
required, (3) a discussion of the development risks, (4) a discussion of the critical testing 
required and (5) the estimated cost, where low cost is approximately $50K to lOOK, medium = 
$100K to 250k and high cost is greater than $250K. 

4.1 VIDEO GENERATOR SUBSYSTEM 

4.1.1 COMPONENTS/FUNCTIONS 

The video generator functions to translate RGB digital video data generated by the image 
generator to a format required by the raster generator. All synchronizing waveform generation, 
scan line and field phasing, video data conversion, gamma compensation and video driver 
functions are perfonmed within this subsystem. This may include the generation of standard or 
non-standard video line, pixel and sweep timing wavefoims. The digital data may be stored or 
buffered using low transport delay processes prior to conversion to analog form with appropriate 
gamma and distortion correction. The preferred method for video data transfer from the IRIS to 
the video generator is via the system bus or in digital form from the video board, whichever 
provides the least transport delay. 

The video generator interfaces to the image generator via shielded digital data lines in order to 
receive and control the flow of pixel data. It has an additional interface to the raster generator

4.1.2 ANALYSIS REQUIRED 

The following analysis should be required for the video generator. 

a. Raster scanning - An analyses should be perfomied to determine the method of raster 

scanning to achieve a ftill 2000 scan line stereopsis field of view. In addition, the 
analyses should determine what impact the proposed raster scanning will have on the 
Government-Specified Graphics Generator in terms of raster distortion, transport 
delays and potential image anomalies with image and head motion. 

b. Timing requirements - An analyses should be performed to determine the 
synchronization required and the timing tolerance which can be pemiitted in this 
subsystem. 

c. Distortion compensation - An analyses should be performed to determine the 
correction if it is required, to compensate for any LS/HMD introduced distortion. 
Affects on geometric accuracy, and effects on resolution shall be addressed. 

d. Make/buy review - An analyses should be performed to determine the design 
characteristics of the raster generator as they relate to the video generator output 
requirements and the overall required system performance. The analyses should 
determine the impact and benefits that would result in any modification to the 
Government-Specified Graphics Generator output format. Affects on transport delay 
shall be addressed. 



A-8 



4.1.3 DEVELOPMENT RISK 

The key technology risks associated with the video generator subsystem as they relate to the 
baseline LS/HMD concept include the raster scanning, the timing requirements, transport delay 
and the distortion compensation. All other design requirements of the subsystem including the 
buffer, line drivers, gamma correction, head tracking interface and the required LS/HMD test 
and alignment patterns have been successfully implemented by many contractors on many 
devices. The primary area of design risk in the video generator is in the development of a design 
which has low transport delay of video data during the conversion process required by the raster 
generator. A Component Risk, Video Subsystem summary of the design risk associated with the 
video generator is provided in Figure 4.1.2-1.

The critical testing associated with the video generator subsystem is as follows: 

a. Synchronization. - Synchronization between the two Government-Specified Graphics 
Generators should be verified for the required video data rates associated with the 
design raster scan characteristics. 



A-9 



4.1.5 COST ESTIMATE 

The video generator hardware has been estimated to be a low cost item. 

42 RASTER GENERATOR SUBSYSTEM 

The raster generator subsystem consists of devices which generate the color raster images with 
sufficient brightness, resolution and proper size for the visor optic subsystem. The raster 
generator and visor subsystems are the two most critical subsystems required in the full color 
LS/HMD design. 

As depicted by Figure 4.2-1 raster generator functions may be designed either entirely 
on-helmet, off-helmet, or balanced between the two. All current helmet designs may be 
categorized by this diagram. For example, if scanning and image generation occurs entirely 
off-helmet (e.g., CAE FOHMD system), then the entire image must be transferred to the helmet 
via a coherent fiberoptic bundle. On the other hand, if the image is generated entirely on-helmet 
(subminiature CRT and LCD designs), only an electronic umbilical is required. Mixed designs 
(e.g., NTSCs VDRT helmet projection system) employ one axis scanning (horizontal) 
off-helmet and the other (vertical) on-helmet, requiring an umbilical with both optic and 
electronic linkages. Other combinations are possible and indeed may be required to generate fuU 
color rasters which produce the specified image quality at the display. 

42.1 OFF-HELMET COMPONENTS 

It is desirable to have the bulky, heavy or heat producing components off-helmet and have as 
small and flexible an umbilical as is practical. The on-helmet components should be small, light 
weight, and be as physically robust as is practical. The overall location of on-helmet HMD 
components should aUow a design which has a center of gravity approximately centered 
between the observer 's ears, no sharpedges and few protuberances, enabling the nornial range of 

head motion and positioning within normal cockpits to be used. 
4.2.1.1 COMPONENTS 

The off-helmet components, depending on the design approach chosen, have less stringent size, 
weight and configuration requirements than the components allotted to the on-helmet portion of 
the raster generator. As such, risk is reduced as compared to the on-helmet components. Risk is 
also lowered by the intended use of the HMD system as a research tool, rather than a flight-rated 
system. If pixel, line or full scene luminance data are generated off-helmet and transferred to the 
oi>-helmet portion of the HMD, then many off-the-shelf components may be employed in the 
design and the design risk is primarily one of configuration, mounting and setup and adjustment 
of the components. 

All major luminance generating, beam splitting/multiplying, modulating and optical 
components required to produce pixel luminance and send it to the fiber umbUical are off-the 
shelf components of low risk. The overall configuration is low risk, since major components are 
off-helmet. Additional size and complexity reduction is possible with solid state lasers 
employed as luminance generators. Fiber coupling is a known process, but design of the 
quick--disconnect for the umbilical requires careful design . A baseline configuration is 
depicted by Figure 4.2.1.1-1.

42.12 ANALYSES REQUIRED 

a. Laser output power - The laser output power should be analyzed relative to the selected 

fiber optic bundle characteristics, length and eye safety requirements. 

b. Solid state lasers- Solid state lasers which can be directly modulated are preferred over 
gaseous laser which require external modulation hardware. The performance of solid 
state lasers should be investigated in light of their potential payoff. 

42.13 DEVELOPMENT RISK 

The key technology associated with the off-helmet raster generator are low. RGB lasers are 
readily available, as are the modulators and optics required. The primary risk is in designing a 
mount for all of the associated hardware and optical components which permits ease of 
alignment and perfonnance calibration. These factors may influence the image quality of the 
displayed image. 

a. Red, Green and Blue Lasers-Lasers of sufficient power are off-the shelf items. Output 

power requirements will be set by requirements for displayed scene luminance and the 
optical efficiency of the system, including the raster generator, the modulators, the 
optics, the fibers, the optics, screen and visor assembly on the hehnet. Overall 
efficiency is expected to be only a few percent, but the displayed image is small. 
Solid-state devices are currently in accelerated development and at least one company 
sells RGB units. These may be directly modulated, thus saving the cost and 
alignmenment problems associated with the acousto-optic modulators (AOM). Risk is 
associated with the modulation bandwidth of any solid state laser which generates the 
correct wavelength light by means of frequency doubling crystals (KDP). These 
crystals apparently have limited modulation response frequencies and frequency 
doubling thresholds as well. Conventional gas or HeNe lasers are low risk, solid state 
units with the required wavelength are considered medium risk in the near term. 

b. Multi-beam unit (MBS) - The optical derivation of multiple RGB laser beams is a low 

risk area. Size reaquirements are not stringent, as the unit is off-helmet. 

c. Acousto-optic modulators (AOM) - Acousto-optic modulators with analog input and 
wide bandwidth (>20Mhz) are off-the shelf devices. The input response of the analog 
units is not linear, but more closely follows an "S" curve. Provisions to adjust the 
gamma and voltage range for each modulator can be provided by look-up tables in the 
video generator unit. These AOM units, when mounted, must be carefully aligned with 
the incoming laser beams and optical lenses to focus the incoming beams. Solid-state 
lasers with sufficient modulation bandwidth will not require AOMs. A mix of direct and 
AOM modulation is possible, with reduced cost and size benefits. The AOMs are low 
risk, the solid state lasers in all wavelengths and with direct modulation capability are 
medium risk, and are being developed by several companies. 

d. Beam combiners and fiber coupling optics - Each RGB beam set must be combined 
optically to form a color pixel for transfer to the on-helmet scaiming process. A 
dichroic cube, prism or mirror system may be used to form a single beam. A lens with 



A-13 



focal length appropriate for the fiber's numerical aperture (NA) will be required for 
each of the 16 fibers. Optics and beam combiners (dichroics) are off-the-shelf 
components. The mounts are not commercially available, and must be designed for 
rigidity and yet allow alignment. A mechanical or electronic safety system must be 
designed to block the light to the fibers if excessive laser output is detected or if one or 
more scanning elements fails to operate. Manual safety control should also be provided. 
This is a low risk area. 

e. Optical fiber mount - The optical fiber mount must be designed with a 
quick-disconnect feature to allow the helmet to be removed from the fixture. The quick 
disconnect would include both optical fiber and electrical wire connectors. Beam 
expansion coupling methods will reduce coupling variance as the disconnect feature is 
used. This unit must be designed. Some risk is associated with obtaining suitable 
couplers for he small fiber sizes employed here. Couplers should be stacked in a 
common unit for ease of use. The electrical quick-disconnect may be an off-the-shelf 
unit The multi-fiber optical cormector is low to medium risk, the electrical unit has no 
risk. f.Mounting assembly and alignment. - The mounting assembly may require the 
use of a small optical bench for rigidity. The mount and optical alignment fixtures m ay 
be off-the shelf units to reduce cost at the expense of (off-helmet) assembly size. This 
approach is low risk. 

g. Safety subsystem - A mechanical or electronic safety subsystem employing laser 
output level and scanner function sensing shall be provided, along with a manual control 
feature. The system may be an off-the-shelf solenoid-type unit and power sensing may 
employ solid-state sensors, but the control circuits must be designed. This is a low-risk 
area. 

h. Laser/fiber coupling efficiency - Coupling efficiency variation is to be expected and 
may be controlled by alignment and video signal level conversion in addition to the 
normal gamma correction functions. The primary design risk is associated with 
alignment stability and range of video level control. These are low to medium risk areas 
and will affect displayed image quality. 

4^.1.4 CRITICAL TESTING REQUIRED 

a. Laser modulators - The laser and associated modulators should be tested to verify that 

the required pixel rate, luminance levels and range of modulation can be achieved. 

b. Coupling efTiciency - The design shall ensure that optical alignment stability is 
maintained and that adjustments and measuring may be easily performed. Variation 
among units should be held to a practical minimum of no more than two to one. 

c. Output at end of fiber - Optical alignment and electronic voltage conversion 
techniques shall enable displayed luminance and color variation to be virtually 
indiscernible at the display. 



A-14 



4.2.1^ COST ESTIMATE 

The raster generator (off-helmet) subsystem hardware has been estimated to be of medium cost. 

42.1 ON-HELMET SUBSYSTEMS 

4.2.2.1 COMPONENTS 

The on-helmet optical and mechanical components which produce the color image must be 
robust and be configured so that adjustments may be made for scene overlap, interocular 
variation among observers, and focus. Scene alignment and derotation may be assigned either 
to the raster generator or the IRIS image generator system. The raster generator and visor 
subsystem coupling must allow these adjustments to be performed easily and with repeatability. 
The mounting assembly for the on-helmet components must be lightweight, rigid and protected 
by a conferral shell to prevent damage or misalignment of components due to normal handling 
and usage. The primary risk areas for the on-helmet components are weight, size and center of 
gravity of the design, since unconventional processes may be employed to generate high 
resolution color images. The on-helmet components are also most likely to be the main 
components which contribute to the image quality of the observed scenes. 

The selection and configuration of the on-helmet components is of high risk, since color 
generation, high resolution and light weight require novel design solutions for the configuration 
of the on-hehnet portion of the raster generator. The major risk area is the optical layout and 
expected performance of the scaiming process. Scan stability and adjustment processes are also 
high risk, as is image quality The baseline on-hebnet functions are indicated in Figure 4.2.2. 1-1 . 

4J.2.2 ANALYSES REQUIRED

1. Linearity 

2. Drift 

3. Stability 

b. Synchronization signal 

4.2.2 J DEVELOPMENT RISK (ASSOCIATED WITH THE BASELINE APPROACH) 

The key technology risks associated with the on-helmet raster generator are the raster scanner, 
the synchronization feedback required for raster stability, the size and weight of the components 
and the image quality that is produced.

The on-helmet components serve to produce the left and right eye images in a manner suitable 
for the visor optic subsystem to produce stereoptic, overlapping, high resolution color images 

for 

the observer. Each of the following areas are potentially a development risk area for any specific 

on-helmet configuration. 

a. Optical fiber pixel image plane - The optical fibers and their mounts are one of the 
most critical components of the HMD system. The fibers have to be precisely separated 
and aligned such that a continuous image is fonmed without visible segmentation in the 
observed image. Visible segmentation may be formed by inaccuracies in any one of 
four processes: 

1. Fiber position - The fibers must lie in a plane (object plane), be precisely 
separated, and have precise ends so the luminance from each fiber is effectively 
gathered by the input lens. 

2. Color variation among the RGB sources- Color variations among the fibers 
are minimized by obtaining raw red, green and blue luminance from the same 



A-16 



source. Wavelength variance is thus nil. Separate sources, such as solid state 
diode laser sources, will have to be chosen for very close wavelength matching. 

3. Color variation with AOM modulation - Modulation variance can be 
minimized by using lookup tables for each of the video voltages sent to each 
modulator. The lookup-tables are used to equalize the input voltage/output 
modulation response among modulators which feed each fiber. Each RGB 
emitter will have to be setup for equal gray scale response so that mixed colors 
are depicted the same by each segment AOM response has both innate and 
alignment position factors. Both must be minimized. 

4. Scan process nonlinearlty - Non-linearity must be minimized or compensated 

for in order to produce an artifact-free image. 

b. Scanning process - The particular scanning process employed must exhibit a high 
degree of stability and freedom of displayed scene perturbation with normal handling. 
Scan non-linearity must be minimized or compensated for. The configuration must be 
amenable for coupling with the visor subsystem and allowing interocular and image 
positioning adjustments to be made by the observer. Weight and size are key issues, as is 
the resulting physical arrangement and its contribution to overall HMD shape and CG 
when coupled to the visor. A design opportunity exists to integrate portions of the 
scanning subsystem with the design of the visor optic subsystem in order to reduce 
overall weight or to provide a more compact arrangement on the helmet. The 
performance of the scanning process and the visor optics are the two most critical factors 
in the overall research HMD design. 

42.2A CRITICAL TESTING REQUIRED 

a. Optical alignment accuracy - The on-helmet optics must be capable of precisely 

coupling with the visor optics. These tests should be integrated with appropriate visor 
tests. 

b. Fiber optics performance - The fiber optics performance should be measured to 
confirm the manufacturer's specification data. 

c. Scan format and stability - The design shall produce a raster format with the required 

active line count in a format required by the visor optic system. Interocular and position 
adjustments shall be made while maintaining a useful raster format. 

d. Image quality -Measure active line numbers, pixel counts and the overall image for lack 

of discemable artifacts. Luminance and chrominance variation across the image should 
be held to less than 5% within the central 50% area of the image and less that 10% in the 
outer regions. 

4^.2^ COST ESTIMATE 

The cost for the raster generator (on-helmet) subsystem hardware has been estimated to be at 
low cost. 



A-17 



4J VISOR SUBSYSTEM 

4J.1 COMPONENTS 

The visor optics subsystem serves to couple the twin raster images from the on-helmet raster 
generator to the observer as collimated, v/idt field-of view (FOV), high resolution color images 
with an adjustable central overlap area of stereo overlap. The images are collimated and are 
adjustable for the degree of stereo overlap and for the interocular variance of the fifth through 
95th percentile male pilot population. The visor optics subsystem consists of attachments for 
mounting the visor optics to the helmet shell, relay lens(es), holographic lens elements, reflector 
assemblies, and adjustment controls for position, interocular distance, focus and alignment. 
The visor subsystem (Figure 3. 1 .3-1) is fully color corrected and components are constructed of 
non-ftangible materials for safety. Eye relief is sufficient for the use of vision correcting 
spectacles. 

43.2 ANALYSES REQUIRED 

a. Optical design and performance- A detailed optical design and performance analyses 
should be perfonned on the visor assembly as part of the total LS/HMD optical design. 
This will enable the LS/HMD design to be optimum in terms of weight and 
performance. 

4J.3 DEVELOPMENT RISK 

The key technology risks associated with the visor assembly is that a visor assembly providing 
the required perfonnance of the LS/HMD does not exist at this time. Visor technology utilizing 
holography for instance, is still an emeipng technology. As a result the responsiveness to the 
specified LS/HMD performance will not be known until a detaUed analyses and design is 
performed. Such issues as eye relief, fields-of-view, color correction, interocular adjustment 
range and so forth will drive the design but the actual performance which can be achieved is yet 
to be determined. 

The visor system performance and weight are relatively high risk factors in the design of the 
HMD system. Development risk is moderate for full color correction and low distortion. The 
configuration of the visor must also lend itself to the configuration of the raster generator such 
that images produced by the raster generator may be efficiently coupled to the visor subsystem, 
while allowing for interocular and overlap adjustment 

4 J.4 CRITICAL TESTING REQUIRED. 

a. Optical testing - A controlled optical laboratory test of the visor assembly inherent 
performance should be performed prior to its mating with the helmet. This will be 
required since the visor assembly will be a subcontract item being designed and 
manufactured to its own specification. 

4J.5 COST ESTIMATE 

The visor subsystem hardware has been estimated to be at high cost.

4.4 HELMET SUBSYSTEM 

4.4.1 COMPONENTS 

The helmet assembly consists of a durable helmet shell, an adjustable liner which permits 
fitment to head sizes for 5th through 95th percentile male pilots, a detachable protective outer 
shell over the exposed optical components in the raster generator, a boom microphone and its 
attach mounts, a pair of headset speakers and the electrical audio communications umbilical 
cord. The headtrack position coil shall be attached to the center rear of the shell with its umbilical 
attached so as to not restrict normal head motion while the pilot is seated. 

For a research application, the helmet shell does not require the impact protection afforded by a 
flight-rated helmet. The primary purpose of the helmet shell is to serve as a mount for the 
on-helmet raster generator components, the visor subsystem, the communications microphone 
and headset, the umbilical from the off-helmet raster generator, and the headtrack receiver 
module. Adjustment devices for setting the interocular position, visor position and image 
overlap should be easily adjustable by the user. Designing for low weight and ease of fitting to a 
wide variety of subjects are the primary risk areas 

Fitting the helmet snugly and comfortably to a wide variety of head sizes requires the use of 
devices such as inflatable bladders or insertable foam pads to allow the interior space of the 
helmet shell to confonn to a given head size and shape. Once snugly fitted, the visor screens 
must be adjusted to depict both scenes in their proper position and attitude using the adjustment 
knobs provided. A good solution for the fitting problem has low to medium risk. 

Helmet shell weight is a function of materials chosen and fabrication of the shell. Kevlar fiber 
has been successfully used in the design of some light weight, flight-rated HMD designs. Using 
a lightened flight-rated helmet shell is low risk, designing a very lightweight shell has low to 
moderate risk. The proportion of total weight contributed by the shell approximately 20 percent 
of die HMD, the raster generator and visor being the heaviest elements. 

4.4.2 ANALYSES REQUIRED 

a. Optical design and performance. - A detailed optical design and performance analyses 
should be performed on the visor assembly as part of the total LS/HMD optical design. This will 
enable the LS/HMD design to be optimum in terms of weight and performance. 

4.4.2.1 HELMET WEIGHT ANALYSES 

A helmet weight analyses should be performed which will rule out obvious hardware and 
configurations which will lead to unacceptable results. The design and analyses should include a 
weight budget for the helmet, visor and all on-helmet assemblies in order that the 5 pound total 
weight requirement can be achieved if possible. In addition, each assembly should be broken 
down into its unique components in terms of weight and location in order that the total inertia can 
be computed. A weight control plan shall be implemented during the development program to 
monitor and control on-helmet weight. 

4.4.3 DEVELOPMENT RISK 



A-20 



The key technology risks associated with the hehnet assembly in combination with the 
on-helmet and visor hardware includes achieving a weight of 5 pounds or less. 

4.4.4 CRITICAL TESTING REQUIRED 

a. Comfort - The helmet assembly should be tested for comfort for a full range of head 
sizes and shapes. 

b. Weight - The helmet assembly should be tested for weight for a full range of head sizes 
and shapes. 

c. Stability - The helmet assembly should be tested for stability for a full range of head 
sizes and shapes over a full range of head movements utilizing a dummy load which 
simulates the operational weight and inertia. 

d. Head tracking subsystem - The head tracking subsystem should be integrated into the 
stability test in order to be able to correlate head movement data with test subject 
comments.

4.5 HEAD TRACKING SUBSYSTEM 

4.5.1 COMPONENTS 

It is anticipated that the head tracking subsystem will consist of off-the-shelf hardware and 
custom design tracking algorithms. 



A-21 



The headtracker subsystem serves to measure the observer's head position and translation with 
respect to a fixed reference point on the test cockpit structure and send that angular information 
to the IRIS image generator, which responds by adjusting the view window of the displayed 
scene to correspond to the current head position. The subsystem consists of a data computer with 
or without a console, software programs which allow boresighi, calibration and alignment, 
distortion compensation and monitoring of the head position and angles, an interface to the 
image generator and the transmitter and receiver modules which mount on the cockpit structure 
and the helmet shell. 

4J.2 ANALYSES REQUIRED 

a. Algorithm - Prior to system integration the response time associated with the head 
tracker algorithm should be analyzed and established relative to a full range of selected 
training tasks. 

4^.3 DEVELOPMENT RISK 

AU of the components and much of the software are off-the-shelf items of low risk. The 
remaining areas requiring development p>ertain to the integration of the unit into the HMD 
system with the image generator and the production and testing of additional software which are 
required for data transfer, or filtering, rate prediction or other methods of transport delay 
reduction. This risk is low, as many systems are currently in use. The key technology risk 
associated with the head tracker subsystem relates to the tracking algorithm which is to be 
implemented in conjunction with the LS/HMD. Smoothness, transport delays, and so forth can 
be optimized in the tracking algorithm for a specific hardware implementation. In all other 
regards head tracker technology has been successfully implemented in a number of devices over 
the past ten years and should not present a problem. A summary of the head tracking 
development risks is provided in Figure 4.5.2-1. 

4^.4 CRITICAL TESTING REQUIRED

4.6 SYSTEM INTERFACES 

4.6.1 COMPONENTS 

The LS/HMD interface components will varies with each subsystem interface as follows: 

a. IRIS workstation/video generator - Possible IRIS workstation frame buffer 
modification, D/A or D/D video transmission cables, possible custom video generator 
frame buffer and synchronization signal cables from the IRIS workstation. 

b. Video generator/raster generator (off-helmet) - Analog video and synchronization 

signal cables.

helmet. 

h. Head tracking/IRIS workstation - 6 degree of freedom head signals to the IRIS 
woricstation via the head tracking computer. 

4.6.2 ANALYSES REQUIRED 

The analyses which should be performed during Phase I ofthe development program consist of 
the following: 

a. IRIS workstation/video generator - The impact/benefits of modifying the IRIS 
workstation frame buffer configuration relative to the required LS/HMD system 
performance (e.g., transport delay, etc.). 



A-23 



b. Video generator/raster generator (off-helmet) -The format of the transmitted raster 
video. 

c. Raster generator (off-heIniet)/raster generator (on-helmet) -The format of the

minimum weight 

g. Helmet/head tracking - No unique analyses is required. 

h. Head tracking/IRIS workstation - The algorithms which will be utilized with the 
LS/HMD to provide maximum head position accuracy with minimum transport delay. 

4.6.3 DEVELOPMENT RISKS 

Interface development risks are a function of the specific LS/HMD system/subsystem concept. 
Two generic development risks are, however, worth noting. These are the ability to achieve the 
specified operational helmet weight of 5 pounds or less and the system transport delay. All other 
required interface developments can be approached with straight forward engineering 
techniques. 

4.6.4 CRITICAL TESTING 

Critical testing is a function of the recommended program phases as follows: 

a. Phase U - The subsystem integration tests associated with the raster generator and the 
visor are critical. 

b. Phase III - All system integration tests. 

4.6.5 COST ESTIMATE 

The interface subsystem hardware has been estimated to be as medium cost. 

4.7 SYSTEM INTEGRATION 

4.7 SYSTEM TESTS 

4.7.1 IN-PLANT

Government-Specified Graphics Generator workstation. Stereopsis tests can be performed 
utilizing recorded video from the single workstation and with specially produced test patterns.

6.0 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT 

The integrating contractor should establish a program management organization for LS/HMD 
which will be capable of managing both their own resources and those of any required 
subcontractors. LS/HMD involves a wide range of technologies and their management can best 
be handled by a systems house which has the necessary broad base of experience. 



A-25 



The program management, in addition to forming the best team, will have to monitor the design 
progress of LS/HMD through periodic design and progress reviews. Locations of such meetings 
may vary according to the status of a critical aspect(s) of the program and the best location forthe 
review.

3 J.2 MATERIALS, PROCESSES AND PARTS 

The basic requirements for materials, parts and processes are established by best commercial 
practice and shall apply only to the LS/HMD interface design. Commercial off-the-shelf 
equipment is exempted from these requirements. The following shall also apply. 
3 J.2.1 SELECTION OF PARTS 

The LS/HMD is a research tool and as such does not require flight-rated hardware. Parts 
selection shall be made on the basis of achieving the required perfonnance stated herein while 
not compromising the safety of all operators and observers. The safety of the observer (eye, 
electrical, mechanical, etc.) shaU be paramount in the overall LS/HMD design and the selecuon 
of all parts. 

One goal of the LS/HMD shall be to provide a helmetMsor design which is upgradable to 
flight-rated status with minimum redesign. In this regard the selection of minimum weight 
on-helmet parts and their placement is critical in temis of the LS/HMD's total weight and 
inertia. Consideration shall be given to the utUization of a lightweight Kevlar helmet shell. AU 
off-hehnet parts shall emphasize maximum performance and minimum cost. 
3.4 DOCUMENTATION 

AU documentation requirements are contained in the noted section of this specification.

3^.1 MAINTENANCE 

All commercial off-the-shelf hardware (e.g., lasers, head tracker, etc.) shall be exempt from the 
following. AU non-commercial off-the-shelf hardware (e.g., video generator, sweep 
wavefonn generators, deflection amplifiers, etc.) shall be provided with one spare part or 
component in order to minimize the LS/HMD downtime. 

Special tools and test equipment shall be kept to a minimum. Any special tools developed for the 
LS/HMD shall be designed to best commercial practice. 
3J.2 SUPPLY 

The contractor shall provide a list of LS/HMD spares which wiU be required to be located with 
the LS/HMD. 

3 J.3 FACILITIES AND FACILITY EQUIPMENT 

The LS/HMD shaU be designed to integrate with two Government-Specified Graphics 
Generator's atNASA Langley Research Center; Hampton, VA; Building 1268A, Room 1141. 

a. Grounding - The building ground system shall provide convenient attachment 
locations in the instaUation areas for attaching the LS/HMD grounds. The contractor 
shaU be responsible for attaching to the building ground connections provided. 

b. Power - 120 VAC, 60 Hz, single-phase, three wire commercial grade power to

3.6 CHARACTERISTICS OF MAJOR COMPONENTS (BASELINE SYSTEM) 

As a goal, the design shall stress high luminance, fuU color, high resolution and wide field of 
view perfonnance for HMD, as is consistent with the requirements for use as a research HMD 
system which may be further developed into flight-rated hardware. Effort shall be made to 
reduce the aU up weight of the HMD including, but not limiting the design by, the apportionment 
of bulky or heavy components in the display to an off-helmet location. The design shaU be 
sufficienUy durable to withstand the rigors of nomal handling consistent with a research setting. 
Effort shall be made to design all adjustments required to calibrate the helmet to nomial 
flight-crew populations such that research time is maximized. 



B-17 



Known color HMD concepts may be characterized by Figure 3.6-1 . which depicts the possible 
logical arrangements of the color raster generator portion of the HMD design. The raster 
generator and visor subsystems are the two most critical designs for color HMD perfomiance. 
The baseline system, depicted in block diagram form in Figure 3.6-2 indicates one possible 
arrangement in which the laser pixel generators and modulators are positioned off-helmet and 
the scanning process is on-helmet, resulting in the appropriate allocation of bulky and heavy 
components. The baseUne design consists of five major subsystems, one of which is subdivided 
into on- and off-helmet assemblies. 
3.6.1 VIDEO GENERATOR 

The video generator subsystem receives video data from the IRIS image generator and converts 
it to the appropriate form for use by the raster generator's pixel generation and deflection 
functions. All synchronizing waveform generation, scan line and field phasing, video data 
conversion, gamma compensation and video driver functions are performed by this unit. The 
preferred method for video data transfer from the IRIS to the video generator is via the system 
buss or in digital from the video board, whichever provides the least transport delay. A design 
goal is to include processes which minimize any transport delay associated with the use of the 
video generator. Transport delay through the video generator shall be one field (16.67 ms) or 
less. A safety system to prevent eye hazards in case of deflection loss shaU be included and shaU 
be capable of manual initiation 
3.6.1.1 VIDEO GENERATOR INTERFACES 

The video generator shall interface with the IRIS image generator, the raster generator and, if 
required, the headtrack subsystem. The video generator to IRIS interface shaU function to 
provide RGB digital scene data and timing data to the video generator for conversion to the 
fomat required by the raster generator. High speed digital interfaces are preferred, with digital 
to analog and gamma conversion functions perfonned by the video generator. Gamma 
conversion for each primary color and each channel shall have a minimum of 8 break points, 
which may be easily adjustable. A design goal is not to have to modify boards in the IRIS unless 
significant transport delay or cost improvements can be incurred. 

The video generator to raster generator interface shall consist of analog video and digital sweep 
synchronizing data sent to the raster generator and additional status functions being sent from 
the raster generator, such as the safety laser shut-off in case of sweep failure. Voltage levels shall 
be as appropriate for the configuration chosen in the design. 

An interface from die headtrack subsystem to the video generator and from die video generator 
to tiie IRIS is included in the baseline solution only as one possible solution to reducing die 
number of high speed data links required to/from tiie IRIS image generator.

3.6.2 RASTER GENERATOR 

3.6.2.1 OFF-HELMET COMPONENTS 

The off-helmet raster generator components shall consist of primarly two subsystems for each 
display channel: (1) a luminance generation suteystem capable of converting pixel data (e.g., 
analog video voltage) into pixel luminance data for transmission to the on-helmet components 
and (2) a subsystem capable of providing the necessary sweep deflection drive waveforms to 
produce a color image from the pixel luminance data on the helmet. The pixel luminance data is 
transmitted to the on-helmet subsystem by means of a small fiberoptic umbilical which does not 
impede normal head movement from a designated position. The off-helmet hardware shaU 
consist of all of the large heavy hardware. 

3.6.2.1.1 OFF-HELMET COMPONENT INTERFACES. The baseline system requires an 
interface from the video generator to the off-portion of the raster generator for the purpose of 
conveying RGB analog video pixel data to the luminance generator/modulator and 
synchronizing signals to the deflection amplifier electronics. An optical interface from the 

off-helmet portion of the raster generator to the on-helmet portion of the subsystem consists of a 
set of optical fibers protected by a flexible, small umbUical. An electronic interface is required 
for the deflection, communications and headtracking functions. This umbilical containing 
optical fibers and electrical wires must be robust to resist damage from normal handling and 
head movement and, as a goal, be provided with a quick disconnect feature at the off-helmet 
side. 

3.6.2.2 ON-HELMET COMPONENTS. The orv-helmet portion of the raster generator 
components shaU generate two complete ftiU color rasters from scanned pixel luminance data 
received from the flf-helmet components which is suitable for use by the visor optics subsystem. 
The helmet shall utilize only light weight rigidly mounted components in order to maintain high 
image stability within the required total weight. All on-helmet components shall be fuUy 
protected from both physical damage and stray light. A design goal is to provide light weight 
components on-helmet and have the HMD system be both confonnal and maintain the CG 
within normal limits ,of that of the head within a flight helmet. A design goal is for an all-up 
helmet/display weight of less than 5 lbs. 
3.6.2.1 RASTER GENERATOR ON-HELMET INTERFACES 

Interfaces are to the raster generator, the visor, the helmet and the user. 

The interface to the off-helmet portion of the raster generator is through the speciaUy 
constrticted umbilical containing both scanner electrical and image pixel optical data. The 
umbilical shall be mounted on the helmet in such a way as to prevent damage from tension on the 
umbilical of up to 10 lbs. The interface to the user shall consist of mechanical adjustments 
necessary to set interocular distance variances of 58 to 72 mm. These may be combined with 
visor adjustments. 



B-21 



The visor interface shaU provide a 19mm. 3:4 aspect ratio fuU color, high resolution image at the 
appropriate location and orientation for use by the visor subsystem. The interface shaU be 
adjustable but rigid enough to prevent unwanted scene motion due to normal head movements. 
A design opportunity exists to integrate optical elements of the visor and the raster generator to 
further reduce weight. 

The user shall have adjustment knobs for interocular distance spacing and for image positioning 
to facilitate the initial scene alignment. 
3.6J VISOR OPTICS 

The visor optics shall be designed to display the on-helmet rasters as full color, high resolution, 
wide field-of-view, collimated. stereo images to the observer. All visor optics shall be capable 
of being easily attached to and removed from the helmet. The visor shall utilize fuUy color 
corrected non-frangible optics for maximum performance and safety. Eye relief shall be 
sufficient for use of vision correcting spectacles. The visor shall be sufficienUy transparent to 
permit viewing the environment beyond the visor. Visor display performance shall be as stated 
elsewhere herein. 
3.6.4 HELMET-TRACKING SYSTEM 

The helmet-tracking system shall consist of a radiator/sensor pair which shall provide the 
following performance. 

a. Angular coverage. - 4 pi steradian coverage relative to radiator. 

b. Static position accuracy. - 0. 1 inch RMS 

c. Static angular accuracy. - 0.5 degrees RMS 

d. Position resolution. - 0.03 inches 

e. Angular resolution. - 0.1 degrees 

f. Output update rate. - 60 Hertz 

g. Radiator/sensor operating range. - +30.0 inches (without metal interference or post 
processing) 

h. Transport delay. - 1 6.6 msec 

i. Noise. - Noise from all helmet-tracking system sources shall not cause the output to 
command a perceptible dither to the displayed image. 

j . Woricing volume. - The helmet-mounted sensor shall operate reliably within a volume 
prescribed as a box of at least 16 in. on a side. The structure mounted sensor component 
shall be outside that volume. 

3.6.5 HELMET ASSEMBLY 

The helmet assembly shall consist of a durable helmet sheU. an adjustable liner which permits 
fitment to head sizes for 5th through 95th percentile male observers (e.g., pilots), a detachable 



B-22 



protective outer sheU(s) over the exposed optical components in the raster generator, a boom 
microphone and its attachment moimts, a pair of headset speakers, an electrical audio 
communications umbilical cord and a hehnet tracking radiator. The head tracking position coil 
shall be attached to the center rear of the shell with its umbilical attached so as to not restrict 
normal head motion while the observer is seated. The construction of the helmet shall be a light 
as is practical for the research application of the HMD system in order to reduce the overall 
weight of the display to design goals. 

4.0 QUALITY ASSURANCE PROVISIONS 

4.1 GENERAL QUALITY ASSURANCE PROVISIONS 

Unless otherwise specified herein, quality assurance provisions shall be in accordance with best 
commercial practice. The quality assurance program shaU ensure quality throughout all areas of
