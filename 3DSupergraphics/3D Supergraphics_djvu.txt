Supergraphics Three-Dimensional Display System 
P. Lutus Kerby, Oregon 1980 
Introduction 

Supergraphics is a software system that projects 
three-dimensional color images on the Apple II 
screen. The system draws images so fast that 
animated displays are possible. The program is 
completely compatible with Integer and Applesoft 
BASIC languages, the Disk Operating System, and 
other assembly-language programs. Required are an 
Apple II with 48K of Random Access Memory and a 
minimum of 1 disk drive. 

The quality of the graphic images is much better 
than that normally available from Apple. All 
high-resolution graphics colors are available, both 
for image drawing and text displays. 

Access from BASIC is very simple. After 

initialization, simple printed commands such as are 
used by the Disk Operating System command the 
drawing, rotation, scale etc. of the images. 

Demonstration and image development programs are 
provided to aid the software developer. Because 
Supergraphics is a software development tool, these 
instructions assume minimum familiarity with the 
BASIC programming language and the Apple II. 

In these instructions, segments of particular 
interest are preceded by ">»" in the left margin.

General discussion 

This section will help clarify some of 
the operations discussed in Part I. 

In order to understand the interaction 
and behavior of the Position, Translate, and 
Rotate commands, think of the drawing area 
as a box. This box is divided into 255 
segments for each of the three dimensions 
(X, Y, and Z). Anything we draw will be 
contained in this box. The size of the box 
(relative to the TV screen) is set by the 
scale command (%SC). Each direction can be 
scaled separately by the %SX, %SY or %SZ 
commands. Regardless of how the box is 
scaled, it is always divided into 255 
segments along each direction, even though 
these will generally not all be resolved in 
the image. If you draw a line from X=-127 
to X=127, it will go from one side of the 
box to the other. If the box is small, the 
line will be small, and vice versa. When you 
translate the image, you move it within the 
box. If you translate it so that any lines 
go beyond +-127 in any direction, those 
lines will wrap around. 

When you rotate the image, it rotates 
around the center of the box. If you 
translate a centered image from the center 
of the box, the image will no longer rotate 
around its own center, but will move around 
the box center like an object off center on 
a wheel. If you want to move an image, but 
have it rotate around its own center, you 
use the Position commands (%PX, %PY). These 
do not move the image within the box; they 
move the box around on the TV screen but 
keep the image in the same location in the 
box. Any lines that go off the viewing area 
will wrap around (see page 9 under 
"Position").

Let's work a little with GRFBAS to see 
the above concepts in action. Load GRFBAS; 
POKE 16384,255 (this starts a new file), and 
then RUN <RET>. Press "D" for DRAW on the 
menu. We will draw a single line and watch 
what happens with the various SUPERG 
commands. Press "M" <RET> ; you will be 
prompted for the X-coordinate. Type "-32" 
<RET>. This moves the invisible cursor to 
-32 on the X-coordinate. You are then 
prompted for the Y and Z coordinate 
locations. Enter 0 (zero) for both. Now 
type "D", and set X to 32; you can just 
press <RET> for Y and Z to keep them as they 

were (0 in this case). A short line will be 

drawn on the TV. Now press <RET>, and then 
"S" for SHOW from the menu. This mode 
allows you to see what happens with the 
image with the SG commands. Press "C"; you 
will see "ENTER SUPERGRAPHICS COMMAND : ". 

You can now enter any SG command and see 
what happens. Try "SC8" <RET>; the TV goes 
black, but nothing happens to the line. 
This is because the default scale size is 8. 
Try "SC16" <RET>; the line doubles in 
length. Press "R" ; you will see "BASIC 

COMMAND : R (X,Y,Z)?" Press Z and hold it 

down; the line will rotate around its 
center. Bring Z back to 0 and press "T". 
Then press X; the line is being translated 
(within the box). Press X a couple times 
more. Now type "R", and then hold Z down. 
Note that the line now goes around the box 
center. Put the line back to the center by 
typing "C" and then "TX" <RET>. Now type 
"P", and then press X two or three times. 
The line moves as before, but this time the 
box is moving with it. Try "R", then hold 
down the Z key. The line still rotates 
around its own center, since it is still at 
the center of the (invisible) box. Now try 
experimenting on your own.

Part Is Basic Supergraphics 

Your first step in getting to know Supergraphics 
should be the demonstration program "DEMO" provided 
on the system diskette (a listing of "DEMO" is 
included in these instructions). This demonstration 
shows the main features of the program and some 
typical displays. If you are familiar with Apple 
II, you will take note of the fact that text and 
high-resolution images are combined, one of the 
features of Supergraphics. 

»> Source of images 

NOTE: The system diskette program "GRAFBASIC", 
described in Part III, will create images for you 
using a display and text editor format. The 
following section describes the image format for 
the benefit of programmers. It is included for 
reference, and may contain more information than 
needed by normal users. 

One of the principal purposes of Supergraphics is 
to project three-dimensional images. The source for 
these images is a table of coordinate numbers that 
define lines to be drawn. 

»> Cartesian Coordinate System 

For each line ending in the image, three coordinate 
numbers are required, one for each dimension of 
space. The three numbers are assigned the letters 
X, Y, and Z. 

X (by convention) defines a point along the 
horizontal axis. Y defines the vertical axis and Z 
defines a point in depth. This system of numbers is 
called the "Cartesian Coordinate System", developed 
by Renee Descartes. 

Imagine that you are in a large city. Your friend 
is trying to explain the route to his house. He 
lives three blocks east and seven blocks north of 


SuperGraphics 3D Graphics System Manual Page 3 

the bus station and, finally, on the eleventh floor 
of his building. If he and you knew the Cartesian 
Cordinate System, he might say "Walk along X until 
it is equal to 3. Now walk along Z until it is 
equal to 7. Now move along Y until it is equal to 
11. Knock on my door". 

Supergraphics accepts numbers in just this way. A 
table of numbers is created, describing a house or 
an airplane or anything else. Then Supergraphics is 
told where the numbers are located in Apple's 
memory. 

>>> Allowable Image number range 

The value range of the numbers that will be 
accepted by Supergraphics is (integer) -128 to 127 
in the three dimensions X, Y, and Z. This means 
that there are about 16 million definable points in 
the mathematical space of Supergraphics. 

Image coordinate numbers are in sets of four. The 
first number is a command that carries information 
about color and whether to draw a line or simply 
move. The remaining three numbers are the X, Y, and 
Z Cartestian coordinates. Here is a description of 
the number set: 

»> Command Number Format 

Number 1: Command. If this number is less than 128, 
Supergraphics will move, not draw a line, to the 
coordinates that follow. If the number is 128 or 
greater, a line will be drawn. If the number equals 
255, this signals Supergraphics that the end of the 
image table has been reached. 

>» Color Entries 

A color number may be added to the command number 
if desired. Here are the colors and their numbers: 


Number Color 








SuperGraphics 3D Graphics System Manual 


Page 4 


1 Green 

2 Violet 

3 White 

4 Black 

5 Orange 

6 Blue 

7 White 




These colors and their behavior are described in 
Apple literature, particularly the "Applesoft 
Tutorial" and "Apple II Reference Manual". 


To create a command number, select a color if 
desired (this should only be done if the color must 
be changed), then add 128 to the color number if a 
line is to be drawn. If there is no color number 
added to the command value 0/128, the previous 
color will be used. Examples: 


Number Means 

131 Draw a line using color 3 (131*128+3) 

5 Change to color 5 and move to the given 

coordinates 



128 Draw a line using the previously entered 

color 

»> Coordinate Number Format 


Numbers 2-4: These entry numbers are the X, Y, 
and Z coordinates for a point. They are interpreted 
by Supergraphics as lying in the range -128 to 127, 
although BASIC will not place negative numbers 
directly into memory. To prepare the numbers for 
placement into memory, simply add 256 to those 
numbers that are less than 0. A BASIC example: 


V 4 


100 N = N + 256 * (N < 0) 
110 POKE A , N 


»> BASIC DATA Table format 


SuperGraphics 3D Graphics System Manual Page 5 

A simple way to make an image available (not as 
simple as using the program "GRAFBASIC") is to 
enter the numbers into BASIC DATA statements, then 
use a loop to place then into memory. Here is an 
example program to do this: 

10 FOR ADDRESS = START TO HIGHNUMBER 

20 READ NUMBER 

30 IF NUMBER - 255 THEN 70 

40 NUMBER = NUMBER + 256 * (NUMBER < 0) 

50 POKE ADDRESS,NUMBER 

60 NEXT ADDRESS 

70 POKE ADDRESS,NUMBER 

80 REM THE REST OF THE PROGRAM 


999 REM IMAGE DATA STATEMENTS 

1000 DATA 3 , -127, -127, 0 
1010 DATA 128, 127, -127, 0 
1020 DATA 128, 127, 127, 0 
1030 DATA 128, -127, 127, 0 
1040 DATA 128, -127, -127, 0 
1050 DATA 255 

The DATA table provided will draw a square in the 
Xy* Y plane. „ ,«® 

»> Enabling Supergraphics 


To enable Supergraphics, first load it into memory: 

100 PRINT D$ ; "BLOAD OBJ.SUPERG":REM D$ CONTAINS 
C0NTR0L-D 

Then use this command to enable it: 

110 CALL 25472 

After this "CALL" command has been issued (from the 
keyboard or from a program). Supergraphics will 
assume control of all display functions on Apple 
II. All text printing and graphics display will be 
performed by Supergraphics. 












SuperGraphics 3D Graphics System Manual 


Page 6 


NOTE: There is no need to include the normal 
graphics command "HGR" in your program. No features 
of Apple Graphic firmware are used by 
Supergraphics. 

»> Image Table Identification 

At this point. Supergraphics will print any text 
provided, but it won't display any graphic images. 
To make Supergraphics display an image, we must 
tell it where the image is located in memory. Let's 
assume that an image has been loaded into memory 
starting at decimal address 4096. The command to 
enable graphics is: 

120 PRINT "%SH 4096" 

Remember: Each command to Supergraphics must begin 
with a "%" percent sign. The command "%SH" means 
"shape" and it is followed by the beginning address 
of the image table. After this command has been 
printed by BASIC (like all Supergraphics commands, 
it won't appear on the screen), the image will 
appear.

»> Example Images 

To speed up the learning process, you may want to 
load the demonstration images from the system 
diskette rather than create your own. To do so, 
type: 

BLOAD IMAGES 

Now the following images will be accessed by the 
"%SH" addresses listed:

»> Display Commands 


NOTE: Be sure to see Appendix Ar Short-form listing 
of Supergraphics Commands. 


Proper Supergraphic command format within a BASIC 
program requires (as for DOS) that a carriage 
return precede the command line. Here are examples: 


This example will not work: 

10 PRINT "HELLO"; : REM NO CARRIAGE RETURN 
20 PRINT "%RX 20" 


This example will work: 


10 PRINT 

20 PRINT "%RX 20" 


It is not usually necessary to PRINT a carriage 
return, as in the example above. If programming 
problems arise, or a Supergraphics command is 
printed instead of being executed, this may be the 
problem. 


NOTE: Use of the "%" sign in BASIC printing is 
permitted, in positions other than at the line 
beginning. Example: 

10 PRINT "100 % SCORE!" 


The numeric entries to these commands may be in the 
range (+,-) 65536. The entries should be integers. 















SuperGraphics 3D Graphics System Manual Page 8 

Floating point numbers will cause difficulties. 
Example: 

100 X = INT (X) 

110 PRINT "%RX ";X 

>» Display Scale 

Scale numbers in the range -31 to +31 may be 
entered to control the overall image size. Negative 
scale numbers will create an inverted image. 
Example: 

"%SC 20" (SCale) 

Scale numbers may also be used to specifically 
control the scale of the X and Y dimensions. These 
commands stretch the image in the specified 
dimension. Examples: 

"%SX 20" (Scale X) 

"%SY -5" 

»> X Y, Z Rotation 

Here are the Supergraphics commands to rotate the 
image about the axes X, Y, and Z: 

"%RX 10" (Rotate X) 

"%RY 20" 

"%RZ -15" 

The number values are in angular units. Each 
angular unit is equal to 1.4 degrees (360/256). 

»> Translation 

"Translation" means movement along the X, Y, and Z 
axes. If the image is large, the range of 
translation will be correspondingly smaller, 
because the limits of the mathematical space are 
(+,-) 127 in each dimension. If the image values 

P^- us the translation value exceed this range, the 


SuperGraphics 3D Graphics System Manual Page 9 

image will "wrap around" within the defined space. 
Example: 

"%TX 20" (Translate X) 

"%TY -50" 

"%TZ 12" 

»> Position 

This command displaces the image on the Apple II 
graphics screen. Normally the center of the image 
is at X = 128, Y = 96. This value is modified by 

the entered number. Example: 

"%PX -30" moves the X screen image position from 
128 to 98 

"%PY 20" moves the Y screen image position from 96 
to 116 

NOTE: Unlike Apple II graphics. Supergraphics obeys 

the mathematical convention that the lower left of 
the screen is X * 0, Y = 0. 

»> Default Graphics Color 

If an image file has no color specifications, it 
will be drawn in the default color (3). This 
default color may itself be changed using this 
command: 

"%CG 5" (Color Graphic =5) 

This color will be used until (if) a color 
specification appears in the image file. This makes 
it possible to change the color of an image in 
sequential drawings. 

»> Erase screen 

This command erases the text and graphics display. 
There is no numeric entry. Example: 


"%NW" (NeW) 














SuperGraphics 3D Graphics System Manual Page 10 

»> Enable, disable drawing 

These commands enable and disable graphic image 

drawing, while permitting normal text displays on C « 

the graphic screen. Examples: 

"%ND" (No Draw) 

"%YD" (Yes Draw) 


>» Select Graphic, Text 

These commands select the Apple II graphic image or 
the mormal text display. Examples: 


"%TE" (TExt) 
"%GR" (GRaphics) 


»> Text Color 

This command selects the color in which text will 
be printed. Example: 

"%CT 5" (Color Text = 5) 

NOTE: Because of the way by which Apple II 

generates colors, there will be some distortion of 
the printed text when colors other than whites 3 
and 7 are used. Special effects may be obtained 
through experimentation. Color 3 is the normal 
(default) text color. Color 7 gives a "Bold face" 
appearance to the text, useful for emphasis. 

NOTE: To print inverted text (black on white), 

simply enter the Applesoft BASIC command "INVERSE" 
(in Integer BASIC, "POKE 50, 63"). 

»> Quit Supergraphics 

To disable Supergraphics and return to normal Apple 
II operation, use this command: 





"%QT" (QuiT) 



SuperGraphics 3D Graphics System Manual 


Page 11 


Part II: Advanced Supergraphics 

This section describes advanced instructions, 
combinations of instructions and methods. 

»> Command Loops 

In a BASIC program one would rotate an image this 
way: 

10 FOR A - 0 TO 256 STEP 4 
20 PRINT "%RX" ; A 
30 NEXT X 

This method has the significant drawback that 
Applesoft BASIC is more than 100 times slower than 
Supergraphics. Therefore Supergraphics has its own 
control loop capability. Here is an example that 
duplicates the function of the above BASIC segment: 

10 PRINT "%RX 0 T 256 S 4" 

NOTE: When using the loop capability, remember 
that, unlike BASIC, the controlled value must equal 
the ending value at termination. This example: 

10 PRINT "%RX 0 T 255 S 4" 

will loop endlessly, since the controlled value 
will not equal 256 during operation. 

Negative numbers may be used in loop commands: 

10 PRINT "%RX 0 T -256 S -4" 

NOTE: Pressing any keyboard key will exit a loop 

command. This is a useful feature in game programs, 
in which constant animated displays may be 
controlled by the keyboard. This means that a loop 
can be created to rotate an image trtiile a keyboard 
entry is awaited. Example: 

10 PRINT "%RX 0 T 255 S 4" : REM ENDLESS I/)0P 














SuperGraphics 3D Graphics System Manual 
20 INPUT N$ 


Page 12 


»> Multiple command lines 

Each time a command line is printed, the image is 
updated• If it is desired to change more than one 
display constant before displaying the image, 
simply enter all values to be changed on a single 
line. Example: 


r cr 


10 PRINT "%RX ";X;",RY ";Y; ff ,RZ";Z 

Each command is separated in the line by commas. 
Multiple loops may be entered: 


10 PRINT "%RX 0 T 256 S 4,RY 0 T 256 S 4,RZ 0 T 256 
S 4" 


These loops will be executed sequentially. 

»> Multiple images 

NOTE: To fully understand the following method, 

particularly the reference to two display screens, 
read Part IV: System Technical Description. 


< << 


Here is the method to draw multiple images or 
copies of an image. Normally Supergraphics 
,f undraws n the previous image before drawing the new 
image or image position. To prevent this erasure, 
simply make a fl %SH ,f shape address entry. The "%SH" 
command abandons the "undraw" data normally used to 
erase the previous image. Example: 


10 FOR X = -64 TO 64 STEP 32 
20 PRINT "%SH 4096,PX";X 

30 PRINT "%" : REM PLACE IMAGE ON BOTH SCREENS 
40 NEXT X 


i c< 


Notice the null command "%" in line 30. This 
command simply redraws the image without changing 
anything, assuring that both screens carry a copy 
of the image. The image would otherwise flash as 
Supergraphics switches between screens. 


SuperGraphics 3D Graphics System Manual 


Page 13 


This example makes five copies of the image on the 
screen. The described method may be used to repeat 
an image, or develop many images without erasing 
the old ones. 

NOTE: If difficulties arise while using a 

combination of rotation and image switching, simply 
be sure that both screens carry the same image (see 
line 30 in the above example). 

To return to a previous image position, use the 
above method, specifying the old image position (or 
rotation, scale etc.), and make two copies of the 
drawing before moving. Example: 

10 PRINT "%SH 4096,PX"; OLDX ;",PY"; OLDY 
20 PRINT 

30 REM OK TO MOVE 
>» Images with moving parts 

There is a variation on the method just described. 
In this variation, the shape table address is 
changed, but the "undraw" information is retained. 
This means that you can flap the wings on a 
butterfly, for example, or other things that 
require two or more versions of an image. 

In the "DEMO" program this technique is used to 
display the butterfly image. Two butterfly images, 
one with wings up, the other with wings down, are 
used. So it is necessary to change the image 
address, but still "undraw" the previous images. 
Here is an example: 

10 FOR Q - 0 TO 30 
20 PRINT "%SH + ";WINGSUP 
30 PRINT "%SH + ";WINGSD0WN 
40 NEXTQ 

The address numbers "WINGSUP" and "WINGSDOWN" point 
to the beginning addresses of the two versions of 
the butterfly image. 










SuperGraphics 3D Graphics System Manual 


Page 14 


Notice the "+" sign between "%SH" and the number* 
This "+" sign, when used with the "%SH" command, 
preserves the "undraw" information. If the "+" sign 
is not used, the undraw information is abandoned, 
as in the previous example* 

»> Getting a value from Supergraphics 

It may be necessary to obtain a program value from 
Supergraphics, rather than transmitting one. To do 
this, use the following procedure; 

10 PRINT "%RX ?" 

20 RX = PEEK (6) 

The requested command value will be placed in 
memory location 6, where it can be recovered with 
the BASIC "PEEK" feature* In the case of the query: 

10 PRINT "%SH ?" 

The present shape address (two bytes) will be 
provided in locations 6 and 7. To obtain the 

address value, use this method: 

20 ADDRESS = PEEK (6) + PEEK (7) * 256 

>» Text Cursor Display 

One difference between Supergraphics and the 

ordinary Apple text display is that a cursor won't 
automatically appear when a line input is being 
accepted* To make a cursor appear, simply print a 
backspace before the BASIC INPUT statement: 

10 PRINT "ENTER YOUR NAME : " ; CHR$(8); 

20 INPUT "" ; N$ 

The Supergraphics cursor will behave in much the 

same way as the normal Apple cursor, with the 

exception of the ESC cursor control keys* To print 
a cursor in any circumstances (not necessarily for 
an INPUT statement), print it as a character: 


SuperGraphics 3D Graphics System Manual 


Page 15 


10 PRINT CHR$(95) 

»> Text Clear 

The BASIC command "HOME" won't clear the 
Supergraphics screen. The previously described 
"%NW" command should be used to clear the 
Supergraphics display and resets the cursor 
position to the upper left. 

»> VTAB, HTAB, display window 

These BASIC features are duplicated in 
Supergraphics* The Apple II window control 
locations (decimal 32,33,34,35) and the tab control 
commands all function normally* The text display 
will scroll correctly (somewhat more slowly than 
normal), but this may cause difficulties if an 
image is being updated, since relative screen 
positions will be modified by the scroll. 







SuperGraphics 3D Graphics System Manual

Part Ills Use of the "GRAFBASIC" utility program 

This program may be used to create, view and save 
Supergraphic images for use elsewhere. To operate 
the program, type f, RUN GRAFBASIC" (Applesoft BASIC 
is required). A menu will appear. 

The menu options permit you to "(S)how", 11 (D)raw", 
and " (F)ile" an image. First, let's review 
"(D)raw". Press "D". 

A display of the image (if any) and the last 6 
lines of the image table will be displayed, 
followed by a prompts 

(D)RAW, (M)OVE,(1-7) COLOR, (-) DELETE 
EXAMPLES: 'D3','M'. ENTER: 

The "-" command will delete the last entry. The 
"D"raw command will command that a line be drawn. 
The "M" command moves without drawing. These 
commands may be followed by a color number (1-7). 
Remember that a color number should only be entered 
if a color change is required. Specifying a color 
for each line sloVs the display. 

After entering "D" or "M" and the optional color 
number, a new prompt will appear: 

'D' X, Y, Z: 

Now enter the three numbers for X, Y, and Z. The 
numbers should be integers in the range -127, +127. 
After the entry, press RETURN. The entered line 
will appear in the data table and (if command "D" 
has been used) the line will appear in the graphic 
display. To quit the "(D)raw" feature, simply press 
RETURN with no entry from the first of the "(ID)raw" 
prompts• 

NOTE: For maximum display speed, make images as 

much as possible out of line continuations rather 
than moves. This is because each line ending must 


SuperGraphics 3D Graphics System Manual Page 17 

be calculated, and calculation time is a 
significant percentage of display time. Another 
speed hint is to only specify color in line entries 
idien color is to be changed. 

To "(S)how" the image, press "S" from the menu. 
There are a number of options available to rotate, 
scale, and otherwise modify the image. 

To "R ,f otate, "translate, "P"osition, or "S"cale 
the image, simply press the corresponding letter 
key. Now press "X", "Y", or "Z" to carry out the 

command on these dimensions. To change commands, 
press one of the letters "R,T,P,S" again. 

To change the direction of movement while pressing 
the "X,Y,Z" keys, press Subsequent "X,Y,Z ff 

keys will move in the reverse direction. To change 
the step size, press "I" and enter the new 
increment value. 

To zero all display constants, press "*"• Rotation, 
scale, translation and other values will be set to 
0 or their default values. 

To make a direct Supergraphics "C lf ommand, press 
"C". Example: 

ENTER SUPERGRAPHICS COMMAND: RX 0 T 256 S 4 

NOTE: Don't enter the command token before your 
command in this feature. The token is added 
automatically. 

NOTE: All rotations and color inputs made to 

"(S^ow" are preserved for use elsewhere in 
GRAFBASIC. Scale returns to the default value of 8. 

To quit the "(S^ow" feature, press RETURN with no 
command entry. 

To "(F)ile" your image, press "F" from the menu. A 
file name will be requested, followed by a 
specification of "(L)oad or (S)ave". The most

Part IVs System Technical Description 

Supergraphics uses both Apple II high resolution 
display screens for image display. This produces a 
flicker-free graphic display, because image erasure 
and redrawing is conducted on the invisible screen. 
Therefore it is necessary to make two copies of an 
image that is to remain on display. Example: 

10 PRINT "%RX -32” : REM ROTATE X AXIS 
20 PRINT "%" : REM COPY TO OTHER SCREEN 

This procedure need only be used if another image 
is to be drawn and it is desired to keep the first 
on display. 

Text display is made to both screens 
simultaneously, so that graphic screen switching 
won't disrupt the text display. 

Supergraphics uses the following general procedure 
for each image update: 

1. Prepare access to the screen not presently on 
display. 

2. Undraw the old version of the image, if present, 
by zeroing all bytes that were used for the image. 

3. Compute new three-dimensional matrices (see 
below)• 

4. Draw updated image, using matrix transformation. 

5. Switch display to the new image screen. 

NOTE: An additional version of Supergraphics is 
available on the system diskette. Named SUPERB&W, 
this version draws only in black and white. It may 
be used in exactly the same way as described for 
normal Supergraphics. Because it draws in black and 
white, the lines drawn are somewhat more precise. 
Also, this version draws more quickly. Therefore if 
a black and white monitor is in use, or maximum 
speed is desired, use SUPERB&W. 

Supergraphics uses a fast assembly-language matrix 





SuperGraphics 3D Graphics System Manual Page 20 

multiplication algorithm to provide the 

mathematical transformations needed for 

three-dimensional display. The following 3 by 3 
matrices are multiplied together to provide the 
display matrix: 

(X),(Y),(Z) = rotation angles in units (1 unit = 

1.4 degrees) 


X,Y, Z = Cartesian Scalar values 
Matrix 1: 

Scale X 0 0 

0 Scale Y 0 

0 0 Scale Z 

Matrix 2: 


1 0 0 
0 cos (X) -sin (X) 

0 sin (X) cos (X) 


MAtrix 3: 
cos (Y) 0 

0 1 

sin (Y) 0 

Matrix 4: 

cos (Z) -sin (Z) 

sin (Z) cos (Z) 
0 0 


-sin (Y) 
0 

cos (Y) 


0 

0 

1 


The preceding matrices are computed once per image 


SuperGraphics 3D Graphics System Manual Page 21 

The result matrix of the previous multiplications 
is then used to transform each line ending in the 
image, using this final matrix: 

X+X Translation Y+Y translation Z+Z Translation 

0 0 0 

0 0 0 

The plotting coordinates X' and Y' are then offset 
by the coordinates of the screen center: 

Plot X - X' + 128 + X Position 


Plot Y - Y' - 96 + Y Position

Appendix A: Short-form list of Supergraphics 

commands 

The commands listed below become operative after 
Supergraphics has been loaded and initialized# The 
initialization is by way of the command f, CALL 
25472 11 • Here is a BASIC program example: 

10 CALL 25472 

All entries are decimal integers in the range +- 
65536# Some of the commands use only the subset 
+-256 of the entered numbers# 

Most of these commands may be used in the loop 
entry: 

"Z(command) (number) T (number) S (number)" 

This loop entry is equivalent to the basic 
statement: 


FOR (number) TO (number) STEP (number)

Appendix C: Notes to Supergraphics Atari Version 

All effort has been expended to make the Apple II 
and Atari 800 Su^ergraphics versions as rauc^falike 
as possible. The following procedures sKfhld be 
used on the Atari version only: 

1. Loading Supergraphics 
Either: 

A. From Disk Utility, type "L", then "SUPERG" 

Or: 

B. BASIC program load example: 

10 OPEN #1,4,0,"D:SUPERG" 

20 TRAP 70 

30 FOR A = 22010 TO 32000 

40 GET #1,X 

50 POKE (A) ,X 

60 NEXT A 

70 CLOSE //I 

80 GRAPHICS 24 

90 X = USR (22016) 

100 OPEN #1,12,0,"G:" 

110 PRINT #1,"HELLO SUPERGRAPHICS!" 

Notice that the starting address for the loop is 
the file beginning - 6. This is because Atari has a 
special header on binary load files that must be 
discarded. All printing in the program MUST be to 
the I/O block (in this example, #1) opened for 
Supergraphics, otherwise there will be a asty exit 
from the Supergraphics features. 

The Atari version of Supergraphics lies in memory 
between hex $5600 - $6150. Two graphics screens are 
used, lying between $6150 - $A000. 

There are two extra commands in the Atari version, 
used to control screen print position. Example: 

10 PRINT #1, "%VT 10" : REM LINE 10 
20 PRINT #1, "%HT15" : REM COLUMN 15

Loading from disk 

The disk you received can be booted on 
the Atari. Check the disk directory; if you 
have a file "DUP.SYS" you have the newer DOS 
II. This gives you more space to write a 
BASIC program. However, you should not use 
disks formatted with DOS I when the DOS II 
system is booted, and vice versa, unless you 
are thoroughly familiar with both. To use 
DOS II, simply format a clean disk with it 
(using the I command) and use it. You 
should also use the N command to create a 
MEM.SAV file so you can go to DOS without 
losing your program. 

The BASIC program given on page 25 must 
be part of a main program. 

Loading from Tape 

Put the cassette in for the proper side, 
rewind, and advance to 010. Turn the Atari 
OFF, then ON. Press PLAY.

Appendix F: Translate 

Grafbasic will only work with Applesoft in 
ROM. If you have Appleworld, Supergraphics' sister 
product also from United Software of America, and 
Integer BASIC in ROM, then you can use TRANSLATE. 
Grafbasic is not a full text editor. Although 
easier to use than PEEKING and POKING it doesn't 
have full capabilities. If you have Appleworld it 
does have a full texteditor. TRANSLATE will take 
Appleword FIL. files and change them into files 
compatible with thr "SH" command. 

Restrictions: 

The Appleworld file must include only: 
Comments (;) 

Commands (N A) 

Colors 

and X,Y,Z inputs. 

all values must be in the proper range 
(-127 to 127) 

Directions: 

Load and Run TRANSLATE. 

1) . Prompt FILE ? will appear. Type in 
the Appleworld file name. Do not include the FIL 
prefix, it is included for you automaticaly. If 
you get an "FILE NOT FOUND" error and the file is 
in your catalog then probably you put in a space 
when you saved the file and your not putting in a 
space now. 

2) . Prompt SHAPE ADDRESS ? will appear. 
Type in a Decimal (Base 10) number indicating 
where you want the shape table to go. Make sure 
that the area of memory is not used by 
Supergraphics. Allowable rangw is -32767 to 32767. 

3) . The shape table will be placed in 
memory. A prompt will tell you the starting and 
ending addresses and the length. 

4.) To continue. Run again. 


Supergraphics 3D Graphics System Manual page 36 

Appendix G 

J Creating images: 

This is a sample on how to make supergraphics 
shape tables. We will make the pyramid (SH293889) 
and the Spaceship at the begining of the demo 
(SH 28672). 

The first thing to do is graph out the figure 
on a sheet of paper, (see figure a.) Determine the 
cordinates. For the pyramid the four points are: 

X Y Z 

-1 -1 0 

0 11 
0 1-1 
1-10 

Determint the easiest path that will cover all of 
the lines you wish to draw. Try to make as many of 
v the lines continuations, rather than redrawing new 
I lines, for the pyramid you need 2 sets of lines. 

Set one -1,-1,0 to 0,1,1 to 0,1,-1 to -1,-1,0 to 

1,-1,0 to 0,1,1 

Set two 0,1,-1 to 1,-1,0 

Set up the following table: 


Move/color

} and POKE the table in to RAM. 

Note: on the master disk each of the points has 
been multiplied by 127 for a better image (see 
note after Spaceship.
