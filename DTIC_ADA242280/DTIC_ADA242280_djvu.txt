CHAPTER 1 


INTRODUCTION 


The Ada implementation described above was tested according to the Ada 
Validation Procedures [Pro90] against the Ada Standard [Ada83] using the 
current Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC). This Validation Summary 
Report (VSR) gives an account of the testing of this Ada implementation. 

For any technical terms used in this report, the reader is referred to 
IPro90]. A detailed description of the ACVC may be found in the current 
ACVC User's Guide [UG891.

1.3 ACVC TEST CLASSES 

Compliance of Ada implementations is tested by means of the ACVC. The ACVC 
contains a collection of test programs structured into six test classes: 

A, B, C, D, E, and L. The first letter of a test name identifies the class 
to which it belongs. Class A, C, D, and E tests are executable. Class B 
and class L tests are expected to produce errors at compile time and link 
time, respectively. 

The executable tests are written in a self-checking manner and produce a 
PASSED, FAILED, or NOT APPLICABLE message indicating the result when they 
are executed. Three Ada library units, the packages REPORT and SPPRT13, 
and the procedure CHECK FILE are used for this purpose. The package REPORT 
also provides a set of Identity functions used to defeat some compiler 
optimizations allowed by the Ada Standard that would circumvent a test 
objective. The package SPPRT13 is used by many tests for Chapter 13 of the 
Ada Standard. The procedure CHECK_FILE is used to check the contents of 
text files written by some of the Class C tests for Chapter 14 of the Ada 
Standard. The operation of REPORT eUtd CB£CK_FILE is checked by a set of 
executable tests. If these units are not operating correctly, validation 
testing is discontinued. 

Class B tests check that a compiler detects illegal language usage. Class 
B tests are not executable. Each test in this class is compiled and the 
resulting compilation listing is examined to verify that all violations of 
the Ada Standard are detected. Some of the class B tests contain legal Ada 
code which must not be flagged illegal by the compiler. This behavior is 
also verified. 

Class L tests check that an Ada implementation correctly detects violation 
of the Ada Standard involving multiple, separately compiled units. Errors 
are expected at link time, and execution is attempted. 

In some tests of the ACVC, certain macro strings have to be replaced by 
implementation-specific values — for example, the largest integer. A list 
of the values used for this implementation is provided in Appendix A. In 
addition to these anticipated test modifications, additional changes may be 
required to remove unforeseen conflicts between the tests and 
implementation-dependent characteristics. The modifications required for 
this implementation are described in section 2.3.

INTRODUCTION 


For each Ada implementation, a customized test suite is produced by the 
AVF. This customization consists of making the modifications described in 
the preceding paragraph, removing withdrawn tests (see section 2.1) and, 
possibly some inapplicable tests (see Section 2.2 and [UG89]). 

In order to pass an ACVC an Ada implementation must process each test of 
the customized test suite according to the Ada Standard.

addition to 

the tests 

indicated above 

, C35702A was withdrawn 

as a result 


of a challenge by this customer; it was included in the subsequent list of 
withdrawn tests, dated 21 November 1990. 


2.2 INAPPLICABLE TESTS 

A test is inapplicable if it contains test objectives which are irreleveuit 
for a given Ada implementation. Reasons for a test's inapplicability may 
be supported by documents issued by ISO and the AJPO known as Ada 
Commentaries and commonly referenced in the format Al-ddddd. For this 
implementation, the following tests were determined to be inapplicable for 
the reasons indicated; references to Ada Commentaries are included as 
appropriate.

C35713D and B86001Z check for a predefined floating-point type with a 
name other than FLOAT, LONG_FLQAT, or SHORT_FLClAT. 

C45531M..P and C45532M..P (8 tests) check fixed-point operations for 
types that require a SYSTEM.MAX_MANTISSA of 47 or greater; for this 
inplementation, MAX_MANTISSA is less than 47. 

C45536A, C46013B, C46031B, C46033B, and C46034B contain 'SMALL 
representation clauses vdiich are not powers of two. 

CD2A53A checks operations of a fixed-point type for which a length 
clause specifies a power-of-ten TYPE'SMALL; this xuplementation does not 
si^)port decimal 'SHALLs. (See section 2.3.) 

C45624A checks that the proper exception is raised if MACHINE_OVERFLOWS 
is FALSE for floating point types with digits 5. For this 
implementation, MACHINE_OVERFLCIWS is TRUE. 

C45624B checks that the proper exception is raised if MACHINE_OVERFLCiWS 
is FALSE for floating point types with digits 6. For this 
implementation, MACHINE_OVERFLCWS is TRUE. 

C86001F recompiles package SYSTEM, making package TEXT_IO, eind hence 
package REPORT, obsolete. 

B86001Y checks for a predefined fixed-point type other than DURATION. 

C96005B checks for values of type DURATIOSI'BASE that are outside the 
range of DURATION. Ther^ are no such values for this implementation. 

CD1009C uses a representation clause specifying a non-defarilt size for a 
floating-point type.

CE2111C raises a USE_ERROR vrtien file is RESET from IN_FILE to OUT_:iLE. 

CE2203A checks that WRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of the 
external file is exceeded for SEQUENTIAL_I0. This inplementation does 
not restrict file capacity. 

EE2401D and EE2401G use instantiations of package DIRECT_IO with 
unconstrained array types and record types with discrimincuits without 
defaults. These instantiations are rejected by this conpiler. 

CE2401H raises USE_ERROR when CREATE with mode INOUT_FILE is used for 
unconstrained records with default discriminants. 

CE2403A checks that WRITE raises USE_ERROR if the capacity of the 
external file is exceeded for DIRECT_IO. This inplementation does not 
restrict file capacity. 

CE3304A checks that USE_ERROR is raised if a call to SET LINE LENGTH or 
SET_PAGE LENGTH specifies a value that is inappropriate Tor tKe external 
file. THis inplementation does not have inappropriate values for either 
line length or page length. 

CE3413B checks that PAGE raises LAYOUT_ERROR vdien the value of the page 
nuunber exceeds COUNT'LAST. For this implementation, the value of 
COUNT'LAST is greater than 150000 making the checking of this objective 
inpractical. 


2.3 TEST MODIFICATICKS 


Modifications (see section 1.3) were required for 25 tests. 


The following tests were split into two or more tests because this 
implementation did not report the violations of the Ada Standard in the way 
expected by the original tests.

B45102A 

B97103E 


BA2001E was graded passed by Evaluation Modification as directed by the 
AVO. The test expects that duplicate names of subunits with a common 
ancestor will be detected as compilation errors; this implementation 
detects the errors at link time, and the AVO ruled that this behavior is 
acceptable. 

CD2A53A was graded inapplicable by Evaluation Modification as directed by 
the AVO. The test contains a specification of a power-of-10 value as small 
for a fixed-point type. The AVO ruled that, under ACVC 1.11, support of 
decimal smalls may be omitted. 


2-4 





IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES 


EA3004D was graded passed by Evaluation and Processing Modification as 
directed by the AVO. The test requires that either pragma INLINE is obeyed 
for a f\anction call in each of three contexts euid that thus three library 
units are made obsolete by the re-conpilation of the inlined fxanction's 
body, or else the pragma is ignored conpletely. This inplementation obeys 
the pragma except \dien the call is within the package specification. When 
the test's files are processed in the given order, only two units are made 
obsolete; thus, the expected error at line 27 of file EA3004D6M is not 
valid and is not flagged. To confirm that indeed the pragma is not obeyed 
in this one case, the test was also processed with the files re-ordered so 
that the re-conpilation follows only the package declaration (and thus the 
other library mits will not be made obsolete, as they are conpiled later); 
a "NOT APPLICABLE" result was produced, as expected. The revised order of 
files was 0-1-4-5-2-3-6.

Testing of this Ada inplementation was conducted at the customer's site by 
a validation team from the AVF. 


3.2 SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS 

An Ada Implementation passes a given ACVC version if it processes each test 
of the customized test suite in accordance with the Ada Programming 
Language Standard, whether the test is applicable or inappliccible; 
otherwise, the Ada In^lementation fails the ACVC [Pro90]. 

For all processed tests (inapplicable and applicable), a result was 
obtained that conforms to the Ada Programming Language Standard.

PROCESSING INFORMATIC^I 


a) Total Number of Applicable Tests 3789 

b) Total Number of Withdrawn Tests 82 

c) Processed Inapplicable Tests 98 

d) Non-Processed I/O Tests 0 

e) Non-Processed Floating-Point 

Precision Tests 201 

f) Total Number of Inapplicable Tests 299 


g) Total Number of Tests for ACVC 1.11 4170 


All I/O tests of the test suite were processed because this inplementation 
supports a file system. The above number of floating-point tests were not 
processed because they used floating-point precision exceeding that 
supported by the inplementation. When this con 5 >iler was tested, the tests 
listed in section 2.1 had been withdrawn because of test errors. 


3.3 TEST EXECUTIC^I 

A magnetic tape containing the customized test suite (see section 1.3) was 
taken on-site by the validation team for processing. The contents of the 
magnetic tape were loaded onto a VAX/VMS system and then treuisferred to the 
host computer via a FTP LAN network. 

After the test files were loaded onto the host computer, the full set of 
tests was processed by the Ada inplementation. 

Testing was performed using command scripts provided by the customer and 
reviewed by the validation team. See i^pendix B for a conplete listing of 
the processing options for this inplementation. The options invoked 
eaplicitly for validation testing during this test were: 

OPTION/SWIIGH EFFECT 


SHOW -> NO 

WARNING -> NO 
GENERIC => STUB 

ERROR -> 999 

CALLS => INLINED 


Do not show header nor error 
summary in listing. 

Do not include warning messages. 

Place code of generic instantiation 
in separate subunits. 

Maximum number of compilation errors 
permitted before terminating the 
compilation. 

This option allows insertion of code for 
subprograms inline and must be set for 
the pragma INLINE to be operative.

PROCESSING INFORMATIOJ 


TASK => 5 Size of all task stacks to be 5K bytes. 

DIR -> "-SYMB" Directive for linker to generate low 

level debugger symbols= 

MAIN ■> 100 Size of main stack to be lOOK bytes. 


Test output, compiler and linker listings, and job logs were captured on 
magnetic tape and archived at the AVF. The listings examined on-site by 
the validation team were also archived.

APPENDIX A 


MACRO PARAMETERS 


This appendix contains the macro parameters used for customizing the ACVC. 
The meaning and purpose of these parameters are explained in [UG89]. The 
parameter values are presented in two tables. The first table lists the 
values that are defined in terms of the maximum input-line length, which is 
the value for $MAX_IN_LEN—also listed here. These values are expressed 
here as Ada string aggregates, where "V" represents the maximum input-line 
length.

APPENDIX F 


Implementation • Dependent Characteristics 


This appendix summarizes the implementation-dependent characteristics of the Alsys 
386 DOS Compiler (32-bit mode). 

Appendix F is a required part of the Reference Manual for the Ada Programming 
Language (called the RM in this appendix). 

The sections of this appendix are as follows: 

1. The form, allowed places, and effect of every implementation-dependent pragma. 

2. The name and the type of every implementation-dependent attribute. 

3. The spedficatioa of the package SYSTEM. 

4. The description of the representation clauses. 

5. The conventions used for any iinpiementation-geneiated name denoting im¬ 
plementation-dependent components. 

6. The interpretation of expressions that appear in address clauses, including those 
for interrupts. 

7. Any restrictions on unchecked conversions. 

8. Any implementation-dependent characteristics of the input-output packages. 

9. Characteristics of numeric types. 

10. Other implementation-dependent characteristics. 

11. Compiler limitations. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


I 






The name^i[s>'5 Runtime Executive Programs or simply Runtime Executive refers to the 
runtime library routines provided for all Ada programs. These routines implement the 
Ada heap, exceptions, tasking control, and other utility functions. 


General systems programming notes are given in another document, the Application 
Developer’s Guide (for example, parameter passing conventions needed for interface with 
assembly routines). 


Appendix F, Version 5 



Section 1 


Implementation-Dependent Pragmas 


1.1 INLINE 

Pragma INLINE is fully supported; however, it is not possible to inline a subprogram in a 
declarative part. 


1.2 INTERFACE 

Ada programs can interface with subprograms written in Assembler and other languages 
through the use of the predefined pragma INTERFACE and the implementation-defined 
pragma INTERFACE_NAME. 

Pragma INTERFACE specifies the name of an interfaced subprogram and the name of 
the programming language for which parameter passing conventions will be generated. 
Pragma INTERFACE takes the form specified in the RM: 

pragma INTERFACE (language jiame^ sub pr ogram juane)’, 

where, 

■ languagejiame is ASSEMBLER, ADA, or C 

■ subprogram jiame is the name used within the Ada program to refer to the 
interfaced subprogram. 

The only language names accepted by pragma INTERFACE are ASSEMBLER, ADA and 
C. The full implementation requirements for writing pragma INTERFACE subprograms 
are described in iht Application Developer’s Guide. 

The language name used in the pragma INTERFACE does not have to have any 
relationship to the language actually used to write the interfaced subprogram. It is used 
only to tell the Compiler how to generate subprogram calls; that is, what kind of 
parameter passing techniques to use. The programmer can interface Ada programs with 
subroutines written in any other (compiled) language by understanding the mechanisms 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


3 




used for parameter passing by the Alsys DOS Ada Compiler and the corres|X)nding 
mechanisms of the chosen external language. 


13 IP»rrERFACE_NAME 

Pragma INTERFACE_NAME associates the name of the interfaced subprogram with the 
external name of the interfaced subprogram. If pragma INTERFACE_NAME is not used, 
then the two names are assumed to be identicaL This pragma takes the form: 

pragma INTERFACE_NAME {subprogramjiame, stringjiteral)-, 

where, 

■ subprogram jtame is the name used within the Ada program to refer to the 
interfaced subprogram. . 

■ stringjiteral is the name by which the interfaced subprogram is referred to at link 
time. 

The pragma INTERFACE.NAME is used to identify routines in other languages that are 
not named with legal Ada identifiers. Ada identifiers can only contain letters, digits, or 
underscores, whereas the DOS Linker allows external names to contain other charaaers, 
for example, the dollar sign (S) or commercial at sign (@). These characters can be 
specified in the stringjiteral argument of the pragma INTERFACE_NAM£. 

The pragma INTERFACE,NAME is allowed at the same places of an Ada program as the 
pragma INTERFACE (Location restriaions can be found in section 13.9 of the RM.) 
However, the pragma INTERFACE_NAME must always occur after the pragma 
INTERFACE declaration for the interfaced subprogram. 

The stringjiteral of the pragma INTERFACE_NAME is passed through unchanged to the 
DOS object file. The maximum length of the stringjiteral is 40 characters. This limit is 
not checked by the Compiler, but the string is truncated by the Binder to meet the Intel 
object module format standard. 

The user must be aware however, that some tools from other vendors do not fully 
support the standard object file format and may restrict the length of symbols. For 
example, the IBM and Microsoft assemblers silently truncate symbols at 31 characters. 

The Runtime Executive contains several external identifiers. All such identifiers begin 
with either the string "ADA@' or the string ’ADAS®’. Accordingly, names prefixed by 
’ADA®’ or ’ADAS®’ should be avoided by the user.

Appendix F, Version 5 






Example 


package SAMPLE_DATA is 

function SAMPLE_DEVICE (X; INTEGER) return INTEGER; 
function PROCESSJAMPLE (X: INTEGER) return INTEGER; 
private 

pragma INTERFACE (ASSEMBLER. SAMPLE_DEV1CE); 
pragma INTERFACE (ADA, PROCESS_SAMPLE); 

pragma INTERFACE_NAME (SAMPLE_DEVICE, "DEVIOSGET_SAMPLE"); 
end SAMPLE_DATA; 


1.4 INDENT 

Pragma INDENT is only used 'fnxYiAdaReformat. AdaReformat is the AJsys reformatter 
which offers the functionalities of a pretty-printer in an Ada environment. 

The pragma is placed in the source file and interpreted by the Reformatter. The line 

pragma INDENT(OFF); 

cxasK AdaReformat not to modify the source lines after this pragma, while 
pragma INDENT(ON); 

causes AdaReformat to resume its action after this pragma. 

1.5 Other Pragmas 

Pragmas IMPROVE and PACK are discussed in detail in the section on representation 
clauses and records (Chapter 4). 

Pragma PRIORITY is accepted with the range of priorities running from 1 to 10 (see the 
definition of the predefined package SYSTEM in Section 3). Undefined priority (no 
pragma PRIORITY) is treated as though it were less than any defined priority value. 

In addition to pragma SUPPRESS, it is possible to suppress all checks in a given compi¬ 
lation by the use of the Compiler option CHECKS. (See Chapter 4 of the User 's Guide.)

Section 2 

Implementation-Dependent Attributes 


2.1 P’IS_ARRAY 

For a prefix P that denotes any type or subtype, this attribute yields the value TRUE if P 
is an array type or an array subtype: otherwise, it yields the value FALSE. 


2.2 E’EXCEP^^ ^_CODE 

For a prefix F v -enotes an exception name, this attribute yields a value that 
represents the internal code of the exception. The value of this attribute is of the type 
INTEGER. 


13 Attributes Used in Record Representation Clauses 

In to the Representation Attributes of {13.7.2] and [13.7J], the following 

attributes are used to form names of indirea and implidt components for use in record 
representation clauses, as described in Section 4.8.

Section 4 


Support for Representation Clauses 


This section explains how objects are represented and allocated by the Alsys DOS Ada 
compiler and how it is possible to control this using representation clauses. Applicable 
restrictions on representation clauses are also described. 

The representation of an object is closely connected with its type. For this reason this 
section addresses successively the representation of enumeration, integer, floating point, 
fixed point, access, task, array and record types. For each class of type the representation 
of the corresponding objects is described. 

Except in the case of array and record types, the description for each class of type is 
independent of the others. To understand the representation of array and record types it 
is necessary to understand first the representation of their components. 

Apart fiom implementation defined pragmas, Ada provides three means to control the 
size of objects: 

* a (predefined) pragma PACK, applkabie to array types 

■ a record represenution clause 

■ a size specification 

For each class of types the effea of a size specification is described. Interactions among 
size specifications, packing and record representation clauses is described under the 
discussion of array and record types. 

Representation clauses on derived record types or derived tasks types are not supported. 

Size representation clauses on types derived from private types are not supported when 
the derived type is declared outside the private part of the defining package.

4.1 Enumeration Types 


4.1.1 Enumeration Literal Encoding 

When no enumeration representation clause applies to an enumeration type, the 
internal code associated with an enumeration literal is the position number of the 
enumeration literal. Then, for an enumeration type with n elements, the internal codes 
are the integers 0,1,2,, n-1. 

An enumeration represenution clause can be provided to specify the value of each 
internal code as described in RM 13.3. The Alsys compiler fully implements enumeration 
representation clauses. 

As internal codes must be machine integers the internal codes provided by an 
enumeration representation clause must be in the range -2^^.. 

An enumeration value is always represented by its internal code in the program 
generated by the compiler. 


4.1.2 Enumeration Types and Object Sizes 

Minimum sat of an eaumaratUm subtype 

The minimum possible size of an enosietation subtype is the minimum number of bits 
that is necessary for representing the internal codes of the subtype values in normal 
binary form. 

A static subtype, with a null range has a minimum size of 1. Otherwise, if m and M are 
the values of the internal codes associated with the first and last enumeration values of 
the subtype, then its minimum size L is determined as follows. For m > = 0, L is the 
smallest positive integer such that M < = 2^-1. For m < 0, L is the smallest positive 
integer such that -2^*^ < = m and M < = 2^'*-l. For example: 

type COLOR is (GREEN, BLACK, WHITE, RED, BLUE, YELLOW); 

~ The minimum size of COLOR is 3 bits. 

subtype BLACK_AND_WHITE is COLOR range BLACK.. WHITE; 

- The minimum size of BLACK_AND_WHITE is 2 bits. 


16 


Appendix F, Version 5 












subtype BLACK_OR_WHrrE is BLACK_AND_WHrrE range X.. X; 

-- Assuming that X is not static, the minimum size of BLACK_OR_WHITE is 
-- 2 bits (the same as the minimum size of its type mark BLACK_anD_whiTE). 


Size of an enumeration subtype 

When no size specification is applied to an enumeration type or first named subtype, the 
objects of that type or first named subtype are represented as signed machine integers. 
The machine provides 8,16 and 32 bit integers, and the compiler selects automatically 
the smallest signed machine integer which can hold each of the internal codes of the 
enumeration type (or subtype). The size of the enumeration type and of any of its 
subtypes is thus 8,16 or 32 bits. 

When a size specification is applied to an enumeration type, this enumeration type and 
each of its subtypes has the size specified by the length clause. The same rule applies to a 
first named subtype. The size specification must of course specify a value greater than or 
equal to the minimum size of the type or subtype to which it applies: 

type EXTENDED Is 

(- The usual ASCII charaaer set 

NXrt, SOH, STX, ETX, EOT, ENQ, ACK, BEL, 

X y. ’z*, ’I’. DEL, 

- Extended characters 

C_CEDILIA._CAP, U_UMLAUT, E_ACUTE, ...); 
for EXTENDED’SIZE use 8; 

“ The size of type EXTENDED will be one byte. Its objects will be represented 
- as unsigned 8 bit integers. 

The Alsys compiler fully implements size specifications. Nevertheless, as enumeration 
values are cod^ using integers, the specified length cannot be greater than 32 bits. 


Size of the objects of an enumeration subtype 

Provided its size is not constrained by a record component clause or a pragma PACK, an 
object of an enumeration subtype has the same size as its subtype. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


17 



4.2 Integer l^pes 

There are three predefined integer types in the Alsys implementation for I80386 
machines: 

type SHORT_SHORT_INTEGER is range -2**07.. 2**07.1; 
type SHORTJNTEGER is range-2**15 .. 2**15-1; 

type INTEGER is range -2**31.. 2**31-1; 

4.2.1 Integer Type Representation 
An integer type declared by a declaration of the form: 
type T is range L „ R; 

is implicitly derived from a predefined integer type. The compiler automatically selects 
the predefined integer type whose range is the smallest that contains the values L to R 
inclusive. 

Binary code is used to represent integer values. Negative numbers are represented using 
two’s complement 


4.2.2 Integer Type and Object Size 

Minimum size of an integer subtype 

The minimum possible size of an integer subtype is the minimum number of bits that is 
necessary for representing the internal codes of the subtype values in normal binary 
form. 


For a static subtype, if it has a null range its minimum size is 1. Otherwise, if m and M are 
the lower and upper bounds of the subtype, then its minimum size L is determined as 
follows. For m > * 0, L is the smallest positive integer such that M < = 2^'^ For m < 
0, L is the smallest positive integer that -2^'* < = m and M < = 2^‘^-l. For example: 


subtype S is INTEGER range 0.. 7; 
- The minimum size of S is 3 bits. 


18 


Appendix F, Version 5 





subtype D is S range X.. Y; 

-- Assuming that X and Y are not static, the minimum size of 
- D is 3 bits (the same as the minimum size of its type mark S). 


Size of an integer subtype 

The sizes of the predefined integer types SHORT_SHORT_INTEGER, SHORT_INTEGER 
and INTEGER are respeaively 8,16 and 32 bits. 

When no size specification is applied to an integer type or to its first named subtype (if 
any), its size and the size of any of its subtypes is the size of the predefined type from 
which it derives, directly or indirectly. For example: 

type S is range 80.. 100; 

- S is derived from SHORT_SHORT_^INTEGER, its size is 
-- 8 bits. 

type J is range 0.. 255; 

- J is derived from SHORTJNTEGER, its size is 16 bits, 
type N is new J range 80.. 100; 

- N is indirectly derived from SHORT.INTEGER, its size is 
-16 bits. 

When a size specification is applied to an integer type, this intege r t ype and each of its 
subtypes has the size specified by the length clause. The same rule applies to a first 
named subtype. The size specification must of course specify a value greater than or 
equal to the minimum size of the type or subtype to which it applies; 

type S is range 80.. 100; 
for S’SIZE use 32; 

- S is derived from SHORT_SHORT_INTEGER, but its size is 
" 32 bits because of the size specification. 

type J is range 0.. 255; 
forJ’SIZEuse8; 

- J is derived from SHORTJNTEGER, but its size is 8 bits 
~ because of the size specification. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


19 





t}pe N is new J range 80.. 100; 

-- N is indirectly derived from SHORT_INTEGER, but its 
» size is 8 bits because N inherits the size specification 
~ofJ. 


Size of the objects of an integer subtype 

Provided its size is not constrained by a record component clause or a pragma PACK, an 
object of an integer subtype has the same size as its subtype. 


4.3 Floating Point Types 

There are two predefined floating point types in the Alsys implementation for I80386 
machines: 

type SHORT FLOAT is 

digitsdrange-(2.0-2.0**(-23))*10**127.. (2.0 - 2.0**(-23))*2.0‘*127; 
type FLOAT is 

digits 6 range -(2.0 -10-(-23))*2.0**127.. (2.0 - 2.0**(-23))*2.0**127; 
type LONG FLOAT Is 

digits 15 range -(2.0 - L0«*(-5l))*2i)^023 _ (2.0 - 2.0**(-51))»2.0*»1023; 
Note that SHORT_FLOAT has the same range as FLOAT. 


43.1 Floating Point Type Representation 

A floating point type declared by a declaration of the form: 

type T is digits O [range L.. R]; 

is implicitiy derived from a predefined floating point type. The compiler automatically 
selects the smallest predefined floating point type whose number of digits is greater than 
or equal to D and which contains the values L to R inclusive. 

In the program generated by the compiler, floating point values are represented using 
the IEEE standard formats for single and double floats. 


20 


Appendix F, Version 5 








The values of the predefined types SHORT_FLOAT and FLOAT are represented using the 
single float format The values of the predefined type LONG_FLOAT are represented 
using the double float format The values of any other floating point type are represented 
in the same way as the values of the predeflned type from which it derives, directly or 
indirectly. 


43.2 Floating Point T^pe and Object Size 

The minimum possible size of a floating point subtype is 32 bits if its base type is 
SHORT_FLOAT or FLOAT or a type derived from SHORT_FLOAT or FLO.M; ;t is 64 bits 
if its base type is LONG_FLOAT or a type derived from LONG_FLOAT. 

The sizes of the predefined floating point types SHORT_FLOAT and FLOAT is 32 bits and 
LONG_FLOAT is 64 bits. 

The size of a floating point type and the size of any of its subtypes is the size of the 
predeflned type from which it derives direaly or indirectly. 

The only size that can be specified for a floating point type or first named subtype using a 
size spe^cation is its usual size (32 or 64 bits). 

An object of a floating point subtype has the same size as its subtype. 


4.4 Fixed Point T^pes 

4.4.1 Fixed Point l^pe Representation 

If no specification of small applies to a fixed point type, then the value of small is 
determined by the value of delta as defined by RM 3.5.9. 

A specification of small can be used to impose a value of small. The value of small is 
required to be a power of two. 

To implement fixed point types, the Alsys compiler for I80386 machines uses a set of 
anonymous predefined types of the form: 

type SHORT_FIXED is delta D range (-2.0**7-l)*S.. 2.0**7*S; 
for SHORT_FIXED’SMALL use S; 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


21 



type FIXED is delta D range (-2.0**15-1)*S.. 2.0**15*S; 
for FIXED’SMALL use S; 

type LONG_FIXED is delta D range (-2.0**31-1)*S.. 2.0**31*S; 
for LONG_FIXED’SMALL use S; 

where D is any real value and S any power of two less than or equal to D. 

A fixed point type declared by a declaration of the form: 

type T is delta O range L.. R; 
possibly with a small specification: 
for TSMALL use S; 

is implicitly derived from a predefined fixed point type. The compiler automatically 
selects the predefined fixed point type whose small and delta are the same as the small 
and delta of T and whose range is the shortest that includes the values L to R inclusi /e. 

In the program generated by the compiler, a safe value V of a fixed point subtype F is 
represented as the integer 

V/F’BASE’SMALL 


4,4.2 Fixed Point lype and Object Size 
Minimum size of a fixed point subtype 

The minimum possible size of a fixed point subtype is the minimum number of binary 
digits that is necessary for representing the values of the range of the subtype using the 
small of the base type. 

For a static subtype, if it has a null range its minimum size is 1. Otherwise, s and S being 
the bounds of the subtype, if i and I are the integer representations of m and M, the 
smallest and the greatest model numbers of the base type such that s < m and M < S, 
then the minimum size L is determined as follows. For i > = 0, L is the smallest positive 
integer such that I <= 2^'^ For i < 0, Lis the smallest positive integer such that - 
2^‘“< = iandl < = 2^-‘-l. 

type F is delta 2.0 range 0.0 ..*500.0; 

-• The minimum size of F is 8 bits. 


->•> 


Appendix F, Version 5 








subtype S is F delta 16.0 range 0.0.. 250.0; 

- The minimum size of S is 7 bits. 

subtype D is S range X.. Y; 

-- Assuming that X and Y are not static, the minimum size of D is 7 bits 
-- (the same as the minimum size of its type mark S). 


Size of a fixed point subtype 

The sizes of the predefined fixed point types SHORT_FIXED, FIXED and LONG_FIXED 
are respeaively 8,16 and 32 bits. 

When no size specification is applied to a fixed point type or to its first named subtype, 
its size and the size of any of its subtypes is the size of the predefined type from which it 
derives directly or indirealy. For example: 

type S is delta 0.01 range 0.8.. 1.0; 

- S is derived from an 8 bit predefined fixed type, its size is 8 bits, 
type F is delta 0.01 range 0.0.. 2.0; 

~ F is derived from a 16 bit predefined fixed type, its size is 16 bits, 
type N is new F nuigeO.8 > LO; 

“ N is indirealy derived from a 16 bit predefined fixed type, its size is 16 bits. 

When a size specification is applied to a fixed point type, this fixed point type and each of 
its subtypes has the size specified by the length clause. The same rule applies to a first 
named subtype. The size specification must of course specify a value greater than or 
equal to the minimum size of the type or subtype to which it applies: 

type S is delta 0.01 range 0.8.. 1.0; 
rorS’SIZ£use32; 

- S is derived from an 8 bit predefined fixed type, but its size is 32 bits 

- because of the size speafication. 

type F is delta 0.01 range 0.0.. 2.0; 
for FSI2E use 8; 

•• F is derived from a 16 bit predefined fixed type, but its size is 8 bits 
~ because of the size specification. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


23 






type N is new F range 0.8.. 1.0; 

-- N is indirectly derived from a 16 bit predefined fixed type, but its size is 
- 8 bits because N inherits the size specification of F. 

The Alsys compiler fully implements size specifications. Nevertheless, as fixed point 
objects are represented using machine integers, the specified length cannot be greater 
than 32 bits. 


Size of the objects of a fixed point subtype 

Provided its size is not constrained by a record component clause or a pragma PACK, an 
object of a fixed point type has the same size as its subtype. 


4.5 Access Types and Collections 

Access Types and Objects of Access Types 

The only size that can be specified for an access type using a size specification is its usual 
size (32 bits). 

An objea of an access subtype has the same size as its subtype, thus an objea of an 
access subtype is always 32 bits long. 


Collection Size 

As described in RM 13.2, a specification of collection size can be provided in order to 
reserve storage space for the collection of an access type. 

When no STORAGE_SI2^ specification applies to an access type, no storage space is 
reserved for its collection, and the value of the attribute STORAGE_SIZE is then 0. 

The maximum size is limited by the amount of memory available. 


24 


Appendix F, Version 5 




4.6 Task Types 

Storage for a task activation 

As described in RM 13.2, a length clause can be used to specify the storage space (that is, 
the stack size) for the activation of each of the tasks of a given type. Alsys also allows the 
task stack size, for all tasks, to be established using a Binder option. If a length clause is 
given for a task type, the value indicated at bind time is ignored for this task type, and the 
length clause is obeyed. When no length clause is used to spedfy the storage space to be 
reserved for a task activation, the storage space indicated at bind time is used for this 
activation. 

A length clause may not be applied to a derived task type. The same storage space is 
reserved for the activation of a task of a derived type as for the activation of a task of the 
parent type. 

The minimum size of a task subtype is 32 bits. 

A size specification has no effea on a task type. The only size that can be specified using 
such a length clause is its usual size (32 bits). 

An objea of a task subtype has the same size as its subtype. Thus an object of a task 
subtype is always 32 bits long. 


4.7 Array Types 

Each array is allocated in a contiguous area of storage units. All the components have 
the same size. A gap may exist between two consecutive components (and after the last 
one). All the gaps have the same size. 


4.7.1 Array Layout and Structure and Pragma PACK 



Cooponent Gap Component Gap Component Gap 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Charac eristics 


25 












If pragma PACK is not specified for an array, the size of the components is the size of the 
subtype of the components: 

type A is array (1.. 8) of BOOLEAN; 

- The size of the components of A is the size of the type BOOLEAN: 8 bits. 

type DECIMAL_DIGIT is range 0.. 9; 
for DECIMAL_DIGITSIZE use 4; 
type BINARY j:ODED_DECIMAL is 

array (INTEGER range < >) of DECIMAL_DIGIT; 

- The size of the type DECIMAL_DIGIT is 4 bits. Thus in an array of 

- type BINARY_CODED_DECIMAL each component will be represented on 

- 4 bits as in the usual BCD representation. 

If pragma PACK is specified for an array and its components are neither records nor 
arrays, the size of the components is the minimum size of the subtype of the components: 

type A is array (1.. 8) of BOOLEAN; 
pragma PACK(A); 

- The size of the components of A is the minimum size of the type BOOLEAN: 

-1 bit 

Qrpe DECIMAL_OIGIT is range 0.. 9; 
for DEOMAL.DIGrrSIZE ose 32; 
type BINARY_CODED_DEaMALIs 

array (INTEGER range < >) of DECIMAL_DIGIT; 
pragma PACK(BINARY_CODED_DECIMAL); 

- The size of the type DECIMAL_DIGn' is 32 bits, but, as 

- BINARY_CODED_DECIMAL is packed, each component of an array of this 

- type will be represented on 4 bits as in the usual BCD representation. 

Packing the array has no effect on the size of the components when the components are 
records or arrays, since records and arrays may be assigned addresses consistent with the 
alignment of their subtypes. 


26 


Appendix F, Version 5 





Gaps 

If the components are records or arrays, no size specification applies to the subtype of 
the components and the array is not packed, then the compiler may choose a 
representation with a gap after each component, the aim of the insertion of such gaps is 
to optimize access to the array components and to their subcomponents. The size of the 
gap is chosen so that the relative displacement of consecutive components is a multiple 
of the alignment of the subtype of the components. This strategy allows each component 
and subcomponent to have an address consistent with the alignment of its subtype: 

type R is 
record 

K: SHORT_INTEGER; 

B: BOOLe]^; 

end record; 
for R use 
record 

K at 0 range 0.. 31; 

B at 4 range 0.. 0, 
end record; 

- Record type R is byte aligned. Its size is 33 bits, 
type A is army (1.. 10) of R; 

~ A gap of 7 bits is inserted after each component in order to respea the 
—alignment of type R. The size of an array of type A will be 400 bits.

-- There is no gap in an array of type B because 

- NR has a size specification. 

- The size of an object of type B will be 240 bits.

4.7.2 Array Subtype and Object Size 
Size of an array subtype 

The size of an array subtype is obtained by multiplying the number of its components by 
the sum of the size of the components and the size of the gaps (if any). If the subtype is 
unconstrained, the maximum number of components is considered. 


28 


Appendix F, Version 5 







The size of an array subtype cannot be computed at compile time 

■ if it has non-static constraints or is an unconstrained array type with non-static 
index subtypes (because the number of components can then only be determined at 
run time). 

■ if the components are records or arrays and their constraints or the constraints of 
their subcomponents (if any) are not static (because the size of the components and 
the size of the gaps can then only be determined at run time). 

As has been indicated above, the effea of a pragma PACK on an array type is to suppress 
the gaps. The consequence of packing an array type is thus to reduce its size. 

If the components of an array are records or arrays and their constraints or the 
constraints of their subcomponents (if any) are not static, the compiler ignores any 
pragma PACK applied to the array type but issues a warning message. Apart from this 
limitation, array packing is fully implemented by the Alsys compiler. 

A size specification applied to an array type or first named subtype has no effect. The 
only size that can be specified using such a length clause is its usual size. Nevertheless, 
such a length clause can be useful to verify that the layout of an array is as expected by 
the application. 

Sizeof the objectri^an aiTOf subtype 

The size of an object of an array subtype is always equal to the size of the subtype of the 
objea. 


4.8 Record Types 

4.8.1 Basic Record Structure 

Layout of a record 

Each record is allocated in a contiguous area of storage units. The size of a record 
component depends on its type. 

The positions and the sizes of the components of a record type object can be controlled 
using a record represenution clause as described in RM 13.4. In the Alsys 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


29 









implementation for I80386 machines there is no restriction on the position that can be 
specified for a component of a record. If a component is not a record or an array, its size 
can be any size from the minimum size to the size of its subtype. If a component is a 
record or an array, its size must be the size of its subtype.

Pragma PACK has no effect on records. It is unnecessary because record representation 
clauses provide full control over record layout 

A record representation clause need not spealy the position and the size for every 
component If no component clause applies to a component of a record, its size is the 
size of its subtype. 

4.8^ Indirect Components 

•OFFSET 

If the offset of a component cannot be computed at compile tine, this oC^t is stored in 
the record objects at run time and used to access the component Such a component is 
said to be indirea while other components are to be direct:

A direct and an indirect component 

If a record component is a record or an array, the size of its subtype may be evaluated at 
run time and may even depend on the discri^nants of the reconL We will call these 
components dynamic components: 

type DEVICE is (SCREEN, PRINTER); 

type COLOR is (GREEN, RED, BLUE); 

type SERIES is array (POSITIVE range < >) of INTEGER; 

type GRAPH (L : NATURAL) is 
record 

X: SERIES( 1.. L); -- The size of X depends on L 
Y: SERIES(1.. L); -- The size of Y depends on L 

end record; 

Q: POSITIVE; 


32 


Appendix F, Version 5 



type PICTURE (N ; NATURAL; D : DEVICE) is 

record 

F: GRAPH(N); - The size of F depends on N 
S: GRAPH(Q); -- The size of S depends on Q 
case D is 

when SCREEN = > 

C: COLOR; 
when PRINTER = > 
null; 
end case; 
end record; 

Any component placed after a dynamic component has an offset which cannot be 
evaluated at compile time and is thus indirect. In order to minimize the number of 
indirea components, the compiler groups the dynamic components together and places 
them at the end of the record; 


D = SCREEN D = PRINTER 

N « 2 N = 1 



S 



The record type PICTURE: F and S are placed at the end of the record. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


33 






Note that Ada does not allow representation clauses for record components with non¬ 
static bounds [RM 13.4.7], so the compiler’s grouping of dynamic components does not 
conflict with the use of represenution clauses. 

Because of this approach, the only indirect components are dynamic components. But 
not all dynamic components are necessarily indirect: if there are dynamic components in 
a component list which is not followed by a variant part, then exactly one dynamic 
component of this list is a direct component because its offset can be computed at 
compilation time (the only dynamic components that are direct components are in this 
situation):

The record type GRAPH: the dyttarrac component X is a direct component 


The offset of an indirect component is always expressed in storage units. 

The space reserved for the offset of an indirea component must be large enough to store 
the size of any value of the record type (the maximum potential oflset). The compiler 
evaluates an upper bound MS of this size and treats an off^t as a component having an 
anonymous integer type whose range is 0.. MS. 

If C is the name of an indirea component, then the offset of this component can be 
denoted in a component clause by the implementation generated name C’OFFSET.

Appendix F, Version 5 





4.83 Implicit Components 

In some circumstances, access to an object of a record type or to its components involves 
computing information which only depends on the discriminant values. To avoid 
recomputation (which would degrade performance) the compiler stores this information 
in the record objects, updates it when the values of the discriminants are modified and 
uses it when the objects or its components are accessed. This information is stored in 
special components called implicit components. 

An implicit component may contain information which is used when the record object or 
several of its components are accessed. In this case the component will be included in any 
record object (the implicit component is considered to be declared before any variant 
part in the record type declaration). There can be two components of this kind; one is 
called RECORDJIZE and the other VARIANT_INDEX. 

On the other hand an implicit component may be used to access a given record 
component In that case the implicit component exists whenever the record component 
exists (the implicit component is considered to be declared at the same place as the 
record component). Components of this kind are called ARRAY_DESCRIPTORs or 
RECORD.DESCRIPTORs. 


'RECORDJIZE 

This implicit oomponent is created by the oompilerwbeo the record type has a variant 
part and its discriminants are defaulted. It contains the size of the storage space 
necessary to store the current value of the record object (note that the storage effectively 
allocated for the record objea may be more than this). 

The value of a RECORD_SIZE component may denote a number of bits or a number of 
storage units. In general it denotes a number of storage units, but if any component 
clause specifies that a component of the record type has an of&et or a size which cannot 
be expressed using storage units, then the value designates a number of bits. 

Tlie implicit component RECORD_SIZE must be large enough to store the maximum 
size of any value of the record type. The compiler evaluates an upper bound MS of this 
size and then considers the implicit component as having an anonymous integer type 
whose range is 0.. MS. 

If R is the name of the record type, this implicit component can be denoted in a 
component clause by the implemenution generated name R’RECORD_SIZE. This 
allows user control over the position of the implicit component in the record. 


Appendix F, Impiementation-Dependent Characteristics 


35 






VARIASTJNDEX 

This implicit component is created by the compiler when the record type has a variant 
part. It indicates the set of components that are present in a record value. It is used when 
a discriminant check is to be done. 

Component lists in variant parts that themselves do not contain a variant part are 
numbered. These numbers are the possible values of the implicit component 
VARIANT_INDEX. 

type VEHICLE is (AIRCRAFT, ROCKET, BOAT, CAR); 

type DESCRIPTION (KIND : VEHICLE := CAR) is 
record 

SPEED: INTEGER; 
case KIND is 

when AIRCRAFT ] CAR = > 

WHEELS: INTEGER; 
case KIND is 

when AIRCRAFT = > -1 

WINGSPAN: INTEGER; 
when others = > — 2 

null; 
end case; 

when BOAT »> —3 

STEAM : BOOLEAN; 
when ROCKET = > - 4 

STAGES: INTEGER; 
end case; 
end record; 

The value of the variant index indicates the set of components that are present in a 
record value: 


Variant Index 

Set 

1 

(KINO, SPEED, WHEELS, WINGSPAN> 

2 

(KINO, SPEED, WHEELS) 

3 

(KINO, SPEED. STEAM) 

4 

(KINO, SPEED, STAGES) 


36 


Appendix F, Version 5 







A comparison between the variant index of a record value and the bounds of an interval 
is enough to check that a given component is present in the value: 


Component

KINO 

• • 

SPEED

WHEELS 

1 .. 2 

WINGSPAN 

1 .. 1 

STEAM 


STAGES 



The implicit component VARIANTJNDEX must be large enough to store the number v 
of component lists that don’t contain variant parts. The compiler treats this implicit 
component as having an anonymous integer type whose range is 1.. V. 

If R is the name of the record type, this implicit component can be denoted in a 
component clause by the implementation generated name R’VARIANTJNDEX. This 
allows user control over the position of the implicit component in the record. 


•ARRAYJ)ESCRIPTOR 

An implicit component of this kind is associated by the compiler with each record 
component whose subtype is an anonymous am^ subtype that depends on a discriminant 
of the record. It contains information about the component subtype. 

The struaure of an implicit component of kind ARRAY_DESCRIPTOR is not described 
in this documentation. Nevertheless, if a programmer is interested in specifying the 
location of a component of this kind using a component clause, size of the component 
may be obtained using the ASSEMBLY parameter in the COMPILE command. 

The compiler treats an implicit component of the kind ARRAY_DESCRIPTOR as having 
an anonymous array type. If C is the name of the record component whose subtype is 
described by the array descriptor, then this implicit component can be denoted in a 
component clause by the implemenution generated name CARRAY_DESCRIPTOR. 

This allows user control over the position of the implicit component in the record. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


37 









’RECORD_DESCRIPTOR 

An implicit component of this kind is associated by the compiler with each record 
component whose subtype is an anonymous record subtype that depends on a 
discriminant of the record. It contains information about the component subtype. 

The structure of an implicit component of kind RECORD_DESCRIPTOR is not described 
in this documentation. Nevertheless, if a programmer is interested in specifying the 
location of a component of this kind using a component clause, the size of the 
component may be obtained using the ASSEMBLY parameter in the COMPILE 
command. 

The compiler treats an implicit component of the kind RECORD_DESCRIPTOR as 
having an anonymous array type. If C is the name of the record component whose 
subtype is described by the record descriptor, then this implicit component can be 
denoted in a component clause by the implementation generated name 
CRECORD_DESCRIPTOR. This allows user control over the position of the implicit 
component in the record. 


Suppression of Implicit Components 

The Alsys implementation provides the capability of suppressing the implicit 
components RECORD_SC^ and/orVARIANT_INDEX from a record type. This can be 
done using an implemeatatioa defined pragma called IMPROVE. The syntax of this 
pmgma is as follows; 

pragma IMPROVE (TIME | SPACE, (ON = >] simple_name); 

The first argument specifies whether TIME or SPACE is the primary criterion for the 
choice of the representation of the record type that is denoted by the second argument. 

If TIME is specified, the compiler inserts implicit components as described above. If on 
the other hand SPACE is specified, the compiler only inserts a vaRIANT_INDEX or a 
RECORD_SI2I component if this component appears in a record representation clause 
that applies to the record type. A record representation clause can thus be used to keep 
one implicit component while suppressing the other. 

A pragma IMPROVE that applies to a given record type can occur anywhere that a 
representation clause is allowed for this type.

Appendix F, Version 5 





4.8.4 Size of Record l^pes and Objects 

Size of a record subtype 

Unless a component clause specifies that a component of a record type has an offset or a 
size which cannot be express^ using storage units, the size of a record subtype is 
rounded up to a whole number of storage units. 

The size of a constrained record subtype is obtained by adding the sizes of its 
components and the sizes of its gaps (if any). This size is not computed at compile time 

■ when the record subtype has non-static constraints, 

■ when a componen* is an array or a record and its size is not computed at compile 
time. 

The size of an unconstrained record subtype is obtained by adding the sizes of the 
components and the sizes of the gaps (if any) of its largest variant. If the size of a 
component or of a gap cannot be evaluated exactly at compile time an upper bound of 
this size is used by the compiler to compute the subtype size. 

A size spedfication applied to a record type or first named subtype has no effect The 
only size that can be specified using such a length clause is its usual size. Nevertheless, 
such a length clause can be useful to verily that the layout of a record is as expected by 
the application. 


Size of an object of a record subtype 

An object of a constrained record subtype has the same size as its subtype. 

An object of an unconstrained record subtype has the same size as its subtype if this size 
is less than or equal to 8K bytes. If the size of the subtype is greater than this, the object 
has the size necessary to store its current value; storage space is allocated and released as 
the discriminants of the record change.

Section 6 


Address Clauses 


6.1 Address Clauses for Objects 

An address clause can be used to specify an address for an object as described in RM 13.5. 
When such a clause applies to an object, the compiler does not allocate storage for the 
object. The program accesses the object using the address specified in the clause. It is 
the responsibility of the user therefore to make sure that a valid allocation of storage has 
been done at the specified address. 

An address clause is not allowed for task objects, for unconstrained records whose size is 
greater than 8k bytes or for a constant 

There are a number of ways to compose a legal address expression for use in an address 
clause. The most direa ways are: 

■ For the case where the memoiy is defined in Ada as another object use the 
'ADDRESS attribute to obtain the argument for the address clause for the second 
object 

■ For the case where the desired location is memoiy defined in assembly or another 
non-Ada language (is relocatable), an interfaced routine may be used to obtain the 
appropriate address from referencing information known to the other language. 

■ For the case where an address of an object is known by its physical address, it must 
be mapped to the PharLap data segment before it can be accessed via an address 
clause. The reason being that SYSTEMADDRESS is a 32 bit offset in the standard 
PharLap dau segment 

Three Ada callable assembler routines are included in the Alsys Runtime to perform 
physical address mapping. These routines are aDA@MAP_PHYS 1CAL, 
ADA@MAP_PHYS_ADDR, and ADA@GET_PHYS_ADDR.~ ADA@MAP_PHYSICAL 
maps physical pages into the Ada address space. aDA@MAP_PHYS_aDDR maps pages 
that contain specified physical address and size into the Ada address space. 
adA@GET_PHYS_ADDR returns the physical address that corresponds to a given Ada 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


43 





SYSTEMJU3DRESS. To call these routines from an Ada program, use the following 
specifications: 


function MAP_PHYSICAL <PHYSICAL_A0DR : IMTEGER; -- physical address 
PAGE_SIZE : INTEGER) -- size in pages 
return SYSTEM.ADDRESS; — virtual address 
pragma INTERFACE (ASSEMBLER. MAP_PHYStCAL); 
pragma IMTERFACE_MAME (MAP_PHYSICAL, “ADAaMAP_PHYSICAL“); 

where: 

PHYSICAL_ADDR is the physical address of memory pages to map and must be a 
multiple of 4K. 

PAGE_SIZE is the number of physical 4K byte memory pages to map. 


function MAP_PHYS_ADDR (PHYStCAL.ADOR : INTEGER; -- physical address 
MENORY.StZE : INTEGER) •• size in bytes 
return SYSTEM.ADDRESS; •• virtual address 
pragma INTERFACE (ASSEMBLER, mP_PHYS_ADDR); 
pragM IHTERFACE.NAME (MAP^PHYSICAL, ■•ADAaNAP.PHTSJlDDR'’); 

where: 

PHYSICAL_ADDR is the physical address of memory to map. 

MEMORY_SIZE is the number of bytes of physical memory to map. 

Note: The entire page or pages that contain the physical address are mapped. If there 
are other objects on the same page, there is no need to call MAP_PHYS_ADDR for those 
objects as that page is already mapped. Use the address arithmetic routines in package 
SYSTEM to create the vinual addresses for those other objects. 


44 


Appendix F, Version 5 





function GET_PHYS_AODR (STSTEM_AI>OR : SYSTEM.AODRESS) -- virtual address 
return INTEGER; -- physical address 
pragm INTERFACE (ASSEMBLER, GETMAP_PHYS_AODR); 
pragma INTERFACE_NAME (MAP_PHYSICAL. "ADAaCET_PHYS_ADOR"); 

where: 

SYSTEM_ADDR is the Ada system address of an objea. 


With these speciflcaliuns visible from your Ada program, the functions MAP_PHYSICAL 
and MAP_PHYS_ADDR can be called to convert a known physical address to a virtual 
address of type SYSTEM ADDRESS, which can be used in address clauses. 

For example, if there is a memory mapped device whose control register is 10 bytes long, 
with two 32 bit fields and one 16 bit field, located at physical address 800150 (hex). 
Assuming the above MAP_PHYS_ADDR function is visible, this control register can be 
accessed with the following declaration: 

type CONTRa._REO_TYPE U 
record 

FI: INTEGER; 

F2: INTEGER; 

F3: SHORT_INTEGER; 
end record; 

for CONTROL_REG_TYPE use 
record 

Ft at 0 range 0..31; 
f2 at 0 range 31..63; 

F3 at 0 range 64..79; 
end record; 

C0NTR0L_REG : CONTROL_REG_TYPE; 

for CONTROL_REG use at MAP_PHYS_AD0R (16«800150#, 10); 

Note that very call to MAP_PHYSICAL or MAP_PHYS_ADDR causes a new entry to be 
created in the PharLap page table, even if every call is7or the same physical page. Make 
sure that for every physical page, MAP_PHYSICAL and MAP_PHYS_ADDR is executed 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


45 





only once during your program’s execution. If declaration such as the one above for 
CONTROL_R£G is placed within the declarative part of a procedure, and the procedure 
is called repeatedly, one page table entry will be created for CONTROL_REG on every 
procedure call. Thus memory is wasted and you can eventually get a STORAGE_ERROR 
or CONSTRAINT_ERROR if the procedure is called continuously and memory does run 
out. The proper place to put CONTROL_REG, for this case, is within the declarative part 
of a package where MAP_PHYSICAL or MAP_PHYS_ADDR will be executed only once 
during program execution. 


6.2 Address Clauses for Program Units 

Address clauses for program units are not implemented in the current version of the 
compiler. 


6.3 Address Clauses for Interrupt Entries 

Address clauses for interrupt entries are supported. (See Chapter 7 of the Application 
Developer’s Guide for details.) 


46 


Appendix F, Version 5 





Section 7 


Unchecked Conversions 

Unchecked type conversions are described in [13.10.2]. The following restrictions apply 
to their use: 

■ Unconstrained arrays are not allowed as target types. Unconstrained record types 
without defaulted discriminants are not allowed as target types. Access types to 
unconstrained arrays are not allowed as target or source types. Notes also that 
UNCHECKED_CONVERSION cannot be used for an access to an unconstrained 
string. 

■ If the target type has a smaller size than the source type then the target is made of 
the least significant bits of the source. 

If the source and the target types are each of scalar or access type or if they are both of 
composite type, the effect of the funaioa is to return the operand. 

In other cases the eCfect of unchecked conversion can be considered as a copy: 

■ If an oncfaedced conversion of a scalar or source type to a composite target 

type is performed, the rcsoit is a copy of the source operand. The result has the size 
of the source. 

■ If an unchecked conversion of a composite source type to a scalar or access target 
type is performed, the result is a copy of the source operand. The result has the size 
of the target.

Section 8 


Input-Output Packages 

The RM defines the predefined input-output packages SEQUENTIALJO, DIRECT_IO, 
and TEXT_IO, and describes how to use the facilities available within these packages. 
The RM also defines the package IO_EXCEPTIONS, which specifies the exceptions that 
can be raised by the predefined input-output packages. 

In addition the RM outlines the package LOW_LEVELJO, which is concerned with low- 
level machine-dependent input-output, such as would possibly be used to write device 
drivers or access device registers. LOW_LEVEL_IO has not been implemented. The use 
of interfaced subprograms is recommended as an alternative. 


8.1 Correspondence between External Files and DOS Files 

Ada input-output is defined in terms of external files. Data is read from and written to 
external files. Each enemal file is implemented as a standard DOS file, including the use 
of STANDARD_INPUT and STANDARD_OUTPlJT. 

The name of an external file can be either 

■ the null string 

■ a DOS filename 

■ a DOS special file or device name (for example, CON and PRN) 

If the name is a null string, the associated external file is a temporary file ana will cease 
to exist when the program is terminated. The file will be placed in the current directory 
and its name will be chosen by DOS. 

If the name is a DOS filename, the filename will be interpreted according to standard 
DOS conventions (that is, relative to the current directory). The exception 
NAME_ERROR is raised if the name part of the filename has more than 8 characters or 
if the extension pan has more than 3 characters. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


49 





If an existing DOS file is specified to the CREATE procedure, the contents of the file will 
be deleted before writing to the file. 

If a non-existing direaoty is specified in a file path name to CREATE, the direaory will 
not be created, and the exception NAME_ERROR is raised. 


8.2 Error Handling 

DOS errors are translated into Ada exceptions, as deHned in the RM by package 
IO_EXCEPTIONS. In panicular, DEVICE__ERROR is raised in cases of drive not ready, 
unknown media, disk full or hardware errors on the disk (such as read or write fault). 


8 J The FORM Parameter 

The form parameter is a string, formed from a list of attributes, with attributes separated 
by commas. The string is not case sensitive. The attributes specify: 

■ Buffering 

BIJFFER_SIZE = > size JnJ/ytes 

■ Appending 

APPEND »> YES I NO 

■ Truncation of the name by DOS 

TRUNCATE => YES | NO 

■ DIRECTJO on UNCONSTRAINED objects 

RECORD_SIZE = > sizejnjiytes 


where: 

BUFFER_SIZE: Controls the size of the internal buffer. This option is not sup¬ 
ported for DIRECTJO. The default value is 1024. This option has no effect when 
used by TEXT JO with an external file that is a charaaer device, in which case the 
size of the buffer will be 0. 


50 


Appendix F, Version 5 





APPEND: If YES output is appended to the end of the existing file. If NO output 
overwrites the existing file. TTiis option is not supported for DIRECTJO. The 
dehiult is NO. 

TRUNCATE; If YES the file name will be automatically truncated if it is bigger than 
8 characters. The default value is NO, meaning that the exception NAME_ERROR 
will be raised if the name is too long. 

RECORD.SIZE: This option is supported only for DIRECT_IO. This attribute 
controls the logical record length of the external file. 

- When DIRECTJO is instantiated with an unconstrained type the user is 
required to specify the RECORD_SIZE attribute (otherwise USE_ERROR 
will be raised). The value given must be larger or equal to the largest record 
which is going to written. If a larger record is processed the exception 
USE.ERROR will be raised. 

- When DIRECT_I0 is instantiated with a constrained type the user is not 
required to specify the RECORD.SIZE but if the RECORD_SI2 :e is specified 
the only possible value would be the element size in bytes. Any other values 
will raise USE.ERROR. 

The exception USE_ERROR is raised if the form STRING in not conea or if a non 
supported attribute for a given package is used. 


Example: 

FORM => TRUNCATE => YES, APPEND => YES, BUFFER_SIZE => 20480* 


8.4 Sequential Files 

For sequential access the file is viewed as a sequence of values that are transferred in the 
order of their appearance (as produced by the program or run-time environment). This 
is sometimes called a stream file in other operating systems. Each objea in a sequential 
file has the same binary representation as the Ada object in the executable program. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


51 









8.5 Direct Files 


For direct access the file is viewed as a set of elements occupying consecutive positions in 
a linear order. The position of an element in a direct file is speciOed by its index, which is 
an integer of subtype POSrnVE_COUNT. 

DIRECTJO only allows input-output for constrained types. If DIRECT_IO is Instantiated 
for an unconstrained type, all calls to CREATE or OPEN will raise USE_ERROR. Each 
object in a direct file will have the same binary representation as the Ada object in the 
executable program. All elements within the file will have the same length. 

8.6 Text Files 

Text nies are used for the input and output of information in ASCII character form. 

Each text Hie is a sequence of characters grouped into lines, and lines are grouped into a 
sequence of pages. 

All text file column numbers, line numbers, and page numbers are values of the subtype 
POSmVE.COUNT. 

Note that due to the definitions of line terminator, page terminator, and file terminator 
in the RM. and the method used to mark the end of file under DOS, some ASCII files do 
pot represent well-formed TEXTJO files. 

A te.it file is bviScrcd by tbc Runtime Exeetaive unless 

■ it names a device (for example, CON or PRN). 

■ it is STANDARD_INPUT or STANDARD_OUT?UT band has not been redirected. 

If not redirected, prompts written to STANDARD_OUTPUTwith the procedure PUT will 
appear before (or when) a GET (or GET_LINE) occurs. 

The functions END_OF_PAGE and END_OF_FILE always return FALSE when the file is a 
device, which includes the use of the file CON, and STANDARD_INPUT when it is not 
redirected. Programs which would like to check for end of file when the file may be a 
device should handle the exception END_ERROR instead, as in the following example; 


52 


Appendix F, Version 5 









Example 

begin 

loop 

-- Display the prompt: 

TEXT_IO.PUT 

•• Read the next line: 

TEXT_IO.GET_LIME (COMMAMO, LAST); 

-- Now do something with COMMAND (1 .. LAST) 
end loop; 
exception 

when TEXT_IO.END_ERROR => 
null; 

end; 

END_ERROR is raised for STANDARDJNPUT when ^ Z (ASCII.SUB) is entered at the 
keyboard. 


8.7 Access Protection of External Files 

All DOS access protections exist when using files under DOS. If a file is open for read 
only access by one process it can not be opened by another process for read/write access. 


8.8 The Need to Close a Fife Explicitly 

The Runtime Executive will flush all buffers and close all open flies when the program is 
terminated, either normally or through some exception. 

However, the RM does not define what happens when a program terminates without 
closing all the opened files. Thus a program which depends on this feature of the 
Runtime Executive might have problems when poned to another system. 


8.9 Limitation on the Procedure RESET 

An internal file opened for input cannot be RESET for output. However, an internal file 
opened for output can be RESET for input, and can subsequently be RESET back to 
output. 


:3 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 




8.10 Sharing of External Files and Tasking Issues 

Several internal files can be associated with the same external file only if all the internal 
files are opened with mode IN_MODE. However, if a file is opened with mode 
OUT_MODE and then changed to IN_MODE with the RESET procedure, it cannot be 
shared. 

Care should be taken when performing multiple input-output operations on an external 
file during talking because the order of calls to the I/O primitives is unpredictable. For 
example, two strings output by TEXT_10.PUT_LINE in two different tasks may appear in 
the output flle with interleaved characters. Synchronization of I/O in cases such as this is 
the user’s responsibility. 

The TEXTJO files STANDARDJNPUT and STANDARD_OUTPUT are shared by all 
tasks of an Ada program. 

If TEXTJO-ST.ANDARDJNPUT is not redirected, it will not block a program on input. 
All tasks not waiting for input will continue running.

Other Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


10.1 Use of the Floating-Point Coprocessor 

Floating point coprocessor instructions are used in programs that perform arithmetic on 
floating point values in some fixed point operations and when the FLOATJO or 
FIXED_IO packages of TEXT_IO are used. The mantissa of a fixed point value may be 
obtained through a conversion to an appropriate integer type. This conversion does not 
use floating point operations. Object code running on the 80386 using floating point 
instruaions can still execute without the coprocessor if the software floating point 
emulation is linked with the object code (see Binder option FLOAT in User's Guide, 
Section 5.2). See Appendix D of lYit Application Developer’s Guide for more details. 

If a program requiring floating point operation is not linked with the floating point 
emulator, the Runtime Executive will detea the absence of the floating point coprocessor 
by raising CONSTRAINT_ERROR. 

10.2 Characteristics of the Heap 

All objects created by allocators go into the heap. Also, portions of the Runtime Execu¬ 
tive representation of task objects, including the task stacks, arc allocated in the heap. 

UNCHECKED_DEALLOCATTON is implemented for all Ada aixess objects except access 
objects to tasks. Use of UNCHECKED_DEALLOCATION on a task object will lead to 
unpredictable results. 

All objects whose visibility is linked to a subprogram, task body, or block have their 
storage reclaimed at exit, whether the exit is normal or due to an exception. Effectively 
pragma CONTROLLED is automatically applied to all access types. Moreover, all 
compiler temporaries on the heap (generated by such operations as funaion calls 
returning unconstrained arrays, or many concatenations) allocated in a scope are 
deallocated upon leaving the scope. 


Appendix F, Implementation-Dependent Characteristics 


57 





Note that the programmer may force heap reclamation of temporaries associated with 
any statements by enclosing the statement in a begin.. end block. This is especially 
useful when complex concatenations or other heap-intensive operations are performed 
in loops, and can reduce or eliminate STORagE_ERRORs that might otherwise occur. 

The maximum size of the heap is limited only by available memory. This includes the 
amount of physical memory (RAM) and the amount of virtual memory (hard disk swap 
space). 


10 J Characteristics of Tasks 

The default task stack size is IK bytes (32K bytes for the environment task), but by using 
the Binder option STACKTASK the size for all task stacks in a program may be set to a 
size from IK bytes to 64K bytes. 

Normal priority rules are followed for preemption, where PRIORITY values are in the 
range 1.. 10. A task with undefined priority (no pragma PRIORITY) is considered to be 
lower than priority 1. 

The maximum number of aaive tasks is restricted only by memory usage. 

The accepter of a rendezvous executes the accept body code in its own stack. 

Rendezvous with an empty accept body (for synchronization) does not cause a context 
switch. 

The main program waits for compiettoir of all tasks dependent upon library packages 
before terminating. 

Abnormal completion of an aborted task takes place immediately, except when the ab¬ 
normal task is the caller of an entry that is engaged in a rendezvous, or if it is in the 
process of aaivating some tasks. Any such task becomes abnormally completed as soon 
as the state in question is exited. 

The message 

GLOBAL BLOCKING SITUATION DETECTED 

is printed to STANDARD_OUTPUT when the Runtime Executive detects that no further 
progress is possible for any task in the program. The execution of the program is then 
abandoned.

Appendix F, Version 5 





10.4 Definition of a Main Subprogram 

A library unit can be used as a main subprogram if and only if it is a procedure that is not 
generic and that has no formal parameters. 

The Alsys DOS Ada Compiler imposes no additional ordering constraints on 
compilations beyond those required by the language.

Section 11 


Limitations 

11.1 Compiler Limitations 

■ The maximum identifier length is 2SS characters. 

■ The maximum line length is 255 characters. 

■ The maximum number of unique identifiers per compilation unit is 2500. 

■ The maximum number of compilation units in a library is 1000. 

■ The maximum number of Ada libraries in a family is 15. 

11.2 Hardware Related Limitations 

m The maximum amoont of data in tte heap is limited only by available memory. 

« If an unoonsirained record type can exceed 8192 bytes, the type is not permitted 
(unless constrained) as the element type in the definition of an array or record type. 

■ A dynamic object bigger than 40% bytes will be indirectly allocated. Refer to 
ALLOCATION parameter in the COMPILE command. (Section 4.2 of the User’s 
Guide.)
