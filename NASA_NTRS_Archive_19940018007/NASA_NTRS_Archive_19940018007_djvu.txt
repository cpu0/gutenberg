Tel is an embedded control language written in C, running primarily under Unix and with 
an interpreted C look-and-feel. Tk is an Xll toolkit based on tel. Xf is an applications 
builder for tk. The entire package is public domain and available from sprite.berkeley.edu. 
This paper discusses the use of tk to develop a user interface for OSIRIS, an infrared cam- 
era/spectrograph now operational on the OSU Perkins 1.8m telescope. The good and bad 
features of the development process are described.
