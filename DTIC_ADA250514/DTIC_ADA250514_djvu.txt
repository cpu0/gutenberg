PREFACE 


The Ada programming language is not a magic formula for improved applications programming. One of its 
major strengths is that it encoura^ sound software-engineering practices; its successful use requires an 
understanding and appreciation of software engineering. It is essential, therefore, that there be carefully 
planned education and training programs that teach fundamental software-engineering concepts and the 
effective use of the Ada language. 

This publication is intended to serve as a source of information about resources available for: 
those who are planning such programs 
and those who wish to enroll in an Ada course. 

It is hoped that this catalog will serve as a ready reference for Ada course offerings and also that it will 
increase awareness of the many aspects of education in Ada and software engineering.

Catalog of Resources for Education in Ada and Software Engineering (CREASE) 


Version 6 
February 1992 


SECTION 1 

INTRODUCTION & SUMMARY RESULTS 


1.1 INTRODUCTION 

This Catalog of Resources in Ada and Software Engineering (CREASE) lists courses and seminars that provide 
education and training in the Ada language and in software-engineering concepts. The Ada Joint Program Office 
(AJPO) has developed the CREASE in order to rqxnt the availability of Ada-language educational resources within 
academic institutions; this catalog should not be construed as a recommendation or endmsement of any Ada resource 
by the AJPO or the Department of Defense. 


1.1.1 Survey Methodology 

To obtain information on current Ada courses, the Ada Information Gearinghouse (AdalC) surveyed academic 
institutions and commercial technical training companies throughout the United States. The survey was mailed to 
more than 3.S(X) academic institutions: also, copies were distributed at various conferences. An electronic copy of 
the survey was idaced on both the AdalC Bulletin Board and the AJPO host computer (ajpo.sei.cmu.edu) on the Data 
Defense Netwr^ (DDN). Additionally. AdalC staff made several hundred phone calls to follow up on the mailing. 

Survey responses have been stored in a database that will be periodically updated. The process required editing of 
resportses in order to comply with limitations of the tables and formatting requirements; every effort was made to 
preserve the content of each response. 


1.1.2 Organizatioa of CREASE version 6.0 

This document is organized into two main sections, two indicies. and two appendices. They are as follows: 


Section 1 Introduction & Summary Results 

Section 2 Ada Course Offerings 


Section 3 Index by Institution Name 
Section 4 Index by Course Title 


^ipendix A Ada Text Books 

Aiqjendix B CREASE Questionnaire 


The section listing Ada courses is organized alphabetically by state within the United States, and then by counuy. 
A listing of Ada textbodcs and annotated abstracts for many Ada textbooks is provided in Appendix A. For more 
informmion on Ada-language textbooks, contact the AdalC.

Version 6

l.U Updates to CREASE 

The AdalC will jnovide updates on the AJPO host on the DDN and on the AdalC’s electronic bulletin board 
(703/614-021S). The AJPO requests that institutions notify the AdalC of course changes; this can be done eitha 
through U.S. mail (AdalC c/o ITT Research Institute; 46(X) Forbes Boulevard; Lanham, MD 20706-4320), or by 
sending electronic mail to adainfo@ajpo.seLcmu.edu. or by leaving a message on the AdalC Bulletin Board. 

The AJPO iqipreciates your interest in and support of the Dqnrtment of Defense’s Ada program. Questions and 
comments should be referred to the AdalC at l-8(X)-AdaIC-ll at 703/68S-1477. 


12 SUMMARY RESULTS 


More than 6S0 responses were received from 576 different institutions. Mc»e than 500 responses were from four- 
year colleges and universities. The rest were from two-year colleges, technical schools, training companies, and 
Department of Defense (DoD) schools. 

A comparison with the previous CREASE, Version 5.0 ~ which was published in April 1988 -- mdicates a 
continuing growth in Ada’s presence in the acadonic community; 


Number of schools offering Ada courses in Version 5.0; 186 

Number of schools offering Ada courses in Version 6.0: 206 

Number of classes in CREASE 5.0: 256 

Number of classes in CREASE 6.0: 373 


Of all respondents, the breakdown of the institutions by type is; 


4-Year Institutions 571 

2-Year Institutions 48 

Technical Schools 14 

DoD 5

Of all institutions siaveyed, 361 respondents (63%) teach no Ada courses; yet whra asked if offered a free compiler, 
457 (83%) siud that they would consider teaching Ada. Only 91 institutions said they would not teach Ada. On a 
related question, if they were offned free computer-aided-instruction (CAI), 477 (87%) said they would, and only 
72 said they would not

A number of questions were asked about the computer language requirements. An overwhelming majority listed 
Pascal as the primary undergraduate language. At the graduate level, FORTRAN was the language of choice for 
engineering majors, and C and Pascal were listed as languages for graduate progranuners.

Of the institutions that teach Ada courses, the responses yielded similar results. R>r the question regarding the 
primary undergraduate language, there were 140 responses. Of those, 123 require Pascal; 41 require the C languages 
(including C/C-h-); 36 require Ada; IS require Modula2; 12 require COBOL; four require FORTRAN; and one 
requires an assembly language and BASIC. 

Fot the question regarding the total undergraduate language requirements, there were 400 reqx)nses. Of that amount 
130 were for Pascal, 95 were for the C languages (including C/C-m-), 69 were for Ada, 13 were for ModuIa2, 3S 
were for COBOL, 21 were for FORTRAN, and seven were fen- an assembly language. Other languages mentioned 
as being required; LISP, Icon, Predog, Scheme, and PLl. 

For the question requesting language requirements for undergraduate engineers, there were 237 leqxmses. 
FORTRAN was the most required language (86), followed by Pascal (46), C (28), and Ada (7). Modula2, 

Icon, aid Ksembly were also required; 59 responses said "Not Avaibble”. 

There were 197 responses total for primary graduate languages. C had the most responses (52), then Pascal (28), 
and Ada (17). Other languages listed a least once were BASIC, COBOL, FORTRAN, Modula2, LISP, and Prolog; 
87 reqxmses said "Not Available". 

The question regarding language requirements for graduates in computer science showed a narrowing of the gap 
between the numbers. Of 192 responses, C had 33, Pascal 25, Ada 21, and FORTRAN 5. Other languages 
mentioned at least once: COBOL, Modula2, and LISP; 103 reqxnidents said "Not Available".

U.1 Hardware Requirements 

An attempt was nuKte to classify computer hardware requirements into three luoad categwies: mainframes, mini 
computers, and personal computers. The following general guidelines are given: 

Mainframe 

A large, high-speed central processing unit containing a great deal of memny, and serving the 
largest number of users. 

Minicomputer 

A digital computer, smaller than a mainframe, but capable of serving large numbers of usos. May 
include woric stations. 

Personal Computer 

A computer that is smaller in size than either the mainframe ot mini. Used by one person at a 
time. 


Realistically, there is much overli4)ping among the three categories. Even so, the following lists are provided as a 
result of the category definitions.

a certain level of sophistication, general con- 
cq)ts normally found in introductory program¬ 
ming texts are not covered. Also, presumes the 
reader is familiar with operating systems and 
has a basic knowledge of some block-structured 
language such as PL/1 and Pascal.

Dear Educator: 

If your institutimi currently offers courses in the Ada programming language, we would like 
to list information about those courses in our Catalog of Resources for Educatitm in Ada and 
Software Engineering (CREASE), Versitm 6.0, and on our on-line database of Ada 
Education Resources. There is no charge for your institution to be listed in our catalog or 
in our database. 

If your insti tution does not currently offer a course in Ada, but might be interested if you were 
provided with a free Ada compiler, we would like to hear from you. Our sponsoring agency, 
the Ada Joint Program Office, is investigating the possibility of providing ffee Ada compilers 
to educational institutions. 

To be included in the CREASE and to be on the list of parties interested in receiving a free 
Ada compiler, all you need to do is complete the attached survey and return it to the Ada 
Information Clearinghouse at the address given below no later than October 15,1991.
