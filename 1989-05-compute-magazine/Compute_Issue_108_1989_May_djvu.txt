We Know Who 
You Are 



Encased in the frenzied activity of put- 
ting out a monthly magazine, it's all 
too easy for us here to lose sight of the 
boss of the bottom line. No, I'm not talking 
about The Man in New York City, the one 
whose name is in the staff box on page 14. 
I'm talking about the readers of COM- 
PUTE!— you. 

We've recently concluded two surveys 
of COMPUTEI's readers. One, completed at 
the end of 1988, was based on an eight-page 
questionnaire we sent out to every inh sub- 
scriber. We asked 2000 readers what com- 
puters they owned, what computers they 
wished they owned, and what they wanted 
to see in COMPUTE! magazine. We stuck a 
$1 bill in each questionnaire as a token of 
our appreciation. From the looks of things, 
we got our money's worth. 

The second — a reader survey in the 
February issue which we asked you to fill 
out, clip, and mail in — was far more infor- 
mal. That's the way we like to do things 
around here — informally. Unfortunately, 
it's not considered ver>' scientific. 

Yet the results of the two surveys are 
strangely similar. That makes mc feci 
good — casual communication is not dead 
after all, even when it involves speaking to 
hundreds of thousands of people. 

You may know who you are, but now 
we do, too. .A.1I for the better, I assure you, 
for this knowledge will make it possible for 
us to put the best magazine in your hands. 

You're married, a touch over 40, and 
you own a house. You're probably a profes- 
sional, an executive, or a manager; just as 
likely, you've seen the inside of a university, 
even if you don't have a sheepskin. 

More of you own and use MS-DOS ma- 
chines than any other kind of computer. 
That's not surprising, considering the num- 
bers of IBM PC and compatible computers 
that have made it into homes in the past 
year. Our informal survey showed that 47% 
of you own or use an MS-DOS computer at 
home. The more accurate nth survey, how- 
ever, indicated a much higher percentage of 
PC users. I'd agree with that survey, since 
Atari-8-bit owners "packed" the reader sur- 
vey ballot box somewhat by responding 
more often, proportionately, than other ma- 
chine owners. (Atari 8-bit owners have tra- 
ditionally been more vocal in expressing 
their opinions to COMPUTE! magazine 
than any other single group.) 

Commodore 64/128 owners arc the sec- 
ond largest group of COMPUTE! readers, 
followed by (in descending order) Apple 11, 



Atari 8-bit, Macintosh, Amiga, and Atari ST 
owners. 

A majority (69%) own only one com- 
puter, but a good number (31%) have at 
least a pair. The same number (3 1 %) plan to 
add another computer this year. The ma- 
chine of choice for your next purchase? An 
MS-DOS computer, by a slim majority. 
Other lop contenders include the Macin- 
tosh, Amiga 500, and Apple lie. 

You're not a neophyte home computer 
user. Almost three-fourths of you (74%) 
have been using a computer in the home for 
at least two years. More than a fourth of you 
claim that you've been using computers for 
over five years. 

What software do you own and use? 
Word processors and entertainment titles 
top the list, with over 80% of you owning 
software in those categories. Spreadsheets 
and databases aren't loo far behind. More 
than half of you own educational packages. 
You like to buy software, too, for over half 
(56%) bought five or more packages in the 
past year. A fifth of you bought more than 
ten programs in the past 12 months. 

Nearly half of you (45%) have been 
reading COMPUTE! for less than a year, 
which means you've only known COM- 
PUTE! since it dropped its type-in software 
and concentrated instead on providing 
news, reviews, features, and other infor- 
mation for the home computer user. More 
than three-quarters of you want to see more 
articles on general computer topics; you split 
nearly down the middle when asked if you 
want to see more articles specific to one par- 
ticular computer. 

Your favorite parts of COMPUTE! are 
"COMPUTE! Specific" and reviews, fol- 
lowed in close order by "New Products!," 
feature articles, and "News & Notes." You 
read this column most frequently (an assis- 
tant editor claims it's because it's the first 
thing in the magazine), but the other four 
arc not far behind in popularity. 

You want to see applications-oriented 
features most of all, and many of you are in- 
terested in programming your computer. 
COM/' (.TE.' offers a smorgasbord each 
month, but its articles always show how you 
can !«£> your computer. And this month's 
cover feature, "Learn How to Program," will 
undoubtedly be welcomed by many of vou. 

A year ago, I said that COMPUTE! had 
changed because you had. That process is 
ongoing. Your computer needs certainly 
won't remain static. 

Neither will COA/Pt/rE.'. B

286 Christmas Winner 



The Christmas season is 
marked by sales and promo- 
lions designed to get comput- 
ers through America's front 
door. Traditionally. Apple and 
Tandy have led the way in the 
year-end advertising, rebates, 
and discounts of low-end ma- 
chines aimed at potential 
home-computer buyers. But 
the big trend this past year was 
the growing strength of the 
80286-cquippcd<omputer 
market among home and 
smali-busincss buyers. 

.According to Storeboard, 
a Daiias-bascd company that 
tracks retail sales of comput- 
ers, 1988 holiday sates were up 
6.7 percent over 1987 Christ- 
mas sales. Thai rise boosted 
computer makers' revenue 
21.3 percent. 

The clear winners this 
Christmas were 80286-based 
personal computers (.AT-class 
IBM compatibles), which post- 
ed a 44-percenl gain over the 
number of like machines sold 



during the 1987 holiday season. 

Sales of the Apple II rode 
m on the back ofthe lies to 
gain 184 percent in December 
1988 as compared with Novem- 
ber's sales. Still, sales across 
the entire .Apple II line were 
down 50 percent from Christ- 
mas 1987, the result of changing 
distribution channels, price 
hikes, and disenchanted dealers. 

"The fourth quarter has 
always been Apple's strongest," 
noted Storeboard President 
JocAnn Stahcl. "With price 
hikes and shortages, dealers 
had to look for alternatives." 

One of those aliernatives. 
particularly in the education 
market, was the bottom-end 
IBM PS/2 Model 35, which 
lists at under 53,000. Stahcl 
said that the computer sold 
like hotcakes during the holi- 
day season, probably at .Ap- 
ple's expense.

Customers forsook those ma- 
chines for the 1000 TL, which 
offers 80286 performance and 
640KofRAM as standard 
equipment. 

"The TL turned out to be 
a runaway best seller," said Ed 
Juge, Tandy's director of mar- 
ket planning. He attributed the 
shift to customers' wanting the 
full complement of 640K

Tandy were down 1 3 tJerceni 
during the fourth quaner, but 
revenue remained stable. 
"That tells you the sales shift- 
ed from the low end to the 
high end." Juge said. 

"Tandy has always been 
the barometer of what homo 
buyers and small-business 
buyers are getting," Stahel 
said. Manufacturers like Tandy 
misjudged the computer- 
literate audience, which has 
mo\ed toward .AT-compatible 
computers as the entry-level 
machine.

No One's Perfect 

Long known for its business 
acumen and accustomed to 
ever-higher earnings, .Apple 
just got a hefty dose of humil- 
ity. Proving that no company 
is perfect, ilreccnlly an- 
nounced that its second-quarter 
1989 profit might fall by as 
much as 43 percent. Financial 
analysis didn't take kindly to 
ihe bad news, of course, and 
■Apple stock lost S4 a share on 
the day of the poor-profit 
announcement. 

The failoff was caused, 
said .Apple CEO John ScuIIey, 
by major mistakes in anticipat- 
ing DR.AM prices and buyers' 
willingness to pay higher prices 
for the company's Macintosh 
computers. .About to run out 
ofthe inexpensive DR.AM 

6 COMPUTE! 



2-">. r(ov< *,T 




chips that it had been obtain- 
ing under long-term contracts, 
.Apple last summer bouglit as 
much as S80 million worth of 
one-megabit DR.AM chips at 
the height ofthe chip shortage. 
Soon after the purchase, chip 
prices began to fall, .Apple re- 
portedly paid as much as $38 
apiece for chips thai are cur- 
rently selling for $23. The 



company overestimated Mac- 
intosh sales and believed that 
chip supply would be light 
through the end of 1 988. The 
result was a very expensive in- 
ventory of DRAM. 

Tning to make good on 
Ihe blunder only compounded 
Ihe problem. In Sepiember 
1988. .Apple raised prices on 
virtually every one of its com- 
puter products in an effort to 
make back some of its losi 
money. The upper end ofthe 
.Vlaciniosh line was particular- 
ly hard hit, seeing increases of 
nearly 30 percent. Buyers re- 
acted by either shunning the 
Macintosh or by buying 
stripped-down models and 
then fitting ihird-party RAM 
into the machines. Either way. 



chips left Apple at an even 
slower rale. 

(n a double whammy, 
sales ofthe low-end Macintosh 
models — those machines not 
affected by the price in- 
creases — were so high ihat .Ap- 
ple had to go back to the spot 
market to buy the 256-kilobil 
DR.AM chips those machines 
required. 

Apple has tightened its 
bell and lowered prices in re- 
sponse, .A new hiring freeze is 
on, and the company's re- 
search and development bud- 
get has been cut. .And, in 
January, Apple rolled back 
Macintosh prices to levels near 
the prices before the Septem- 
ber increases.

Bring Bush to the Classroom 



The tights dim, the projector 
motor hums sleepily, and it's 
time for another filmstrip — 
static images of outdated infor- 
mal ion, perhaps a recorded 
voice that plays along, and 
sleeping students in the last 
five rows of the classroom. 

Up-to-date technology is 
replacing old-fashioned projec- 
tors. Videodiscs, for instance, 
offer interactive lessons with 
high-quality moving pictures 
and integrated sound. One of 
the newest players in the 
videodisc market is ABC News 
Interactive. 

Working with videodisc 
manufacturer Optical Data, 
ABC News Interactive has re- 
leased The '8S Vote, Cam- 
paign for ihe White House. 
The disc is a collection of film 
and sound clips from the ABC 
news archives. The package in- 
cludes a /f.i'pcrCarrf interface 
for use with a Macintosh, but 
the disc can also be navigated 
without a computer. Optical 
Data is developing a tc.xt- 
based. AppleWorks interface 
for the Apple II market. 

"We're treating the video- 
disc like another broadcast," 
said David Bohrman, e.\ecu- 



tive producer. "The functions 
that we're using to create the 
discs are a lot like the func- 
tions we use to put together 
'Nightlinc' or 'World News 
Tonight.' " 

The '88 Vote follows the 
recent presidential race, from 
theannouncememsofthe 13 
original candidates through 
election night in November. 
The HyperCard interface orga- 
nizes images of the Bush/ 
Dukakis battle by issue rather 
than by chronological order. 
When students click on Prison 
Furlouslis. for example, they'll 
see a point/counterpoint pre- 
sentation of the candidates' 
statements, the commercials 
pertaining to prison furloughs, 
and even .ABC exit poll results 
that show how the issue affect- 
ed the election's outcome. 

"You understand the re- 
sults of the campaign better 
looking at it with these stark 
contrasts," said Bohrman. "It's 
a fascinating experience. The 
tone of the campaign and the 
issues — and the focus (or the 
lack of focus) — is really clear." 

ABC News Interactive 
plans to release between six 
and eight more videodiscs on 




other current and historical is- 
sues, but it hasn't said which 
issues will be covcrcd. 

Thc cooperation between 
■ABC News Interactive and 
Optical Data is a perfect mar- 
riage, according to Pamela L. 
Herber, corporate communica- 
tions director at Optical Data. 
"ABC has this broad, rich col- 
lection of images, and we 



know the education market, so 
together we're going to serve 
the needs of the teachers." 
The '88 I Wi? will cost 
$295 until September 30, when 
the price will increase to $395.

Spidcrman's web and Captain 
America's shield — not to men- 
tion Doctor Doom and his 
henchmen — will soon be mak- 
ing their appearance on disk 
via a licensing arrangement be- 
tween Paragon Software and 



Interactive Spidey, Disk-Based Dr. Doom 

Marvel Comics. 

Dr. Doom 's Revenge, 
scheduled for release this 
spring, is an arcade anthology 
pitting Spidey and Cap against 
"Doom's Brigade." a gathering 
of Marvel villains including 
Rhino, Grey Gargoyle, Eduardo 
Lobo, Mysterio, Electro, Hob- 
goblin, Balroc. and 
others, including a 
gorilla with moves 
Hulk Hogan would 
appreciate. 

.A special Marvel 
comic accompanies 
each package and 
serves to pull in players. 
Spidcrman and Captain 
.America are dispatched 
to Latvcria by none other 
than George Bush, who 
charges Webhead and Wing- 




head with neutralizing a nucle- 
ar missile that Doom has 
aimed at Manhattan. At the 
Latverian lunatic's castle, Spi- 
dey and Cap face a series of ar- 
cade scenarios; each challenge 
is based on a particular vil- 
lain's powers. If the heroes fail, 
Manhattan goes up in a mush- 
room cloud. 

Unlike InfoComics, a 
comic book-format package 
introduced by InfoCom in 
1988, Dr. Doom's Re\'enge 
places its emphasis on action 
rather than on narrative. 
Screens take the form of com- 
ic-book pages, with individual 
panels coming to life as Spidey 
or Cap, in turn, face their 
opponents. 

The IBM version, pre- 
viewed in EG.A, is smoothly 



animated, with colors that 
match those of a typical comic 
book. Rising difTiculty levels 
add to the challenge, while 
subtle background animation 
enhances each scene. Joystick 
control takes some getting 
used to, but it can be mastered. 
The game's primary market 
will probably be younger play- 
ers, although overgrown 
youngsters can have fun shoot- 
ing webs. 

^^i\t Dr. Doom's Re- 
venge is purely arcade-oriented, 
future Paragon/Marvel re- 
leases may offer more depth of 
play and mood. Coming up 
next is the X-Men, those som- 
ber teenage mutants whose 
popularity remains intact even 
when their ranks change.

CD-ROM Is No Game — Or Is It? 

After several years of produc- 
ing productivity titles like en- 
cyclopedias and developer 
toolkits, CD-ROM is begin- 
ning to attract entertainment- 
software developers. 

Activision, whose titles 
are distributed by Mediagenic, 
was the first out the gate. Its 
Manhole is an interactive fan- 
tasy game based on the Hyper- 
Card concept. By moving the 
game to CD-ROM, Activision 
was able to enhance the screen 
images, add digitized voices, 
and include a soundtrack to 
complement the game. 

"The technical con- 
straints [of a disk product] 
affect what you can do cre- 
atively." said Sheny Whiteley, 
general manager of Activision 
entertainment. 

Bob Jacob, president of 
Cinemaware, agreed with 
Whiteley's appraisal. His com- 
pany released a CD-ROM ver- 
sion of its Defender of ihe 
Crown game in March. "Tech- 
nically, we've gone as far as we 
can on disk," he said. 

Cinemaware, like .Acti- 
vision, hired a sound studio to 
produce a soundtrack for its 
game. It also hired an actor to 




narrate the words that appear 
as written text in the disk ver- 
sion. 

The number of people 
who own CD-ROM drives is 
still small, but Activision and 
Cinemaware both regard their 
products as statements of sup- 
port for a blossoming technol- 
og>'. Whiteley said that 
developing Manhole for CD- 
ROM helped Activision real- 
ize the technical problems 
associated with the new medi- 
um and that subsequent re- 
leases would build on that 
knowledge. 

"It's a firm commitment 
on our part to stand behind 



this new technology," said 
Jacob. 

Acti vision's CD-ROM 

game works with .Apple- 
compatible optical drives, 
while Cinemaware's operates 
on the MS-DOS platform, 
Whiteley said Activision is 
looking at a couple of game en- 
gines for use with MS-DOS 
CD-ROM drives, and it will 
almost certainly release a prod- 
uct for that format. 

"Our major revenue pro- 
ducer is still MS-DOS disk 
products, and it will continue 
to be that way for some time," 
Whiteley said. Activision is 
watching the market carefully 



to judge how CD-ROM drives 
are accepted. "CD-ROM can't 
be a mainline strategy," she 
said, "but the company wants 
to be out there with a product." 

The CD-ROM versions of 
both games are priced close to 
the disk-based versions. De- 
fender of the Crown on CD- 
ROM lists for S69.95, com- 
pared with S49.95 for the disk 
version. Aciivision's Manhole 
sells for S59.95 for the CD- 
ROM version and $49.95 for 
the disk version. "We wanted 
to sell to anybody who had a 
ROM drive," Whiteley said. 

The success of CD-ROM 
games will depend heavily on 
the sales of CD-ROM drives in 
the market. So far, the prices of 
those drives have been so far 
above traditional hard disk 
prices that consumers have 
hesitated in taking the plunge. 
But Panasonic's introduction 
of an MS-DOS CD-ROM 
drive for under S500 may 
weaken consumer resistance. 
For the people at Activision 
and Cinemaware, that's the 
break they're looking for. 

"CD-ROM really is the 
future," said Whiteley.

Computer, Take a Letter 

In Star Trek IV: The Voyage 
Home, everyone laughed when 
Mr. Scott tried to access an or- 
dinary- Macintosh just by say- 
ing Computer. 

Everyone, that is, except 
for the people at .Articulate 
Systems. 

The Massachusetts-based 
hardware company has an- 
nounced a new hardware prod- 
uct called Voice Navigator. 
Voice Navigator accepts spo- 
ken commands that .Articulate 
Systems programs into the de- 
vice. The vocabulary repre- 
sents commands from the 
most popular Macintosh soft- 
ware, such as Excel and Hyper- 
Card. To accommodate more 
obscure programs. Voice Navi- 
gator comes with software that 
lets users add commands to 
the vocabulary. 



If Mr. Scott were planning 
to use Voice Navigator, he 
would have to train it to under- 
stand his speech, brogue and 
all. That process doesn't take 
long, according to the develop- 
ers; it's just a matter of repeat- 
ing the commands a few times. 
Once it has learned Mr. Scott's 
voice. Voice Navigator will 
understand him as well as any 
human can. If he comes down 
with laryngitis, though, there's 
a chance the device won't rec- 
ognize his voice. .And Voice 
Navigator won't accept voice 
commands from other people 
once it's learned to listen to 
Mr. Scott. 

Although Voice Navigator 
is the first voice-recognition 
product for the Macintosh, 
comparable PC-based devices 
have been on the market for 




years. Dragon Systems, the 
company that licensed Voice 
Navigator's software, has 
developed several voice- 
recognition products. Most 
recently, the company an- 
nounced a voice-controlled 
typewriter called Dragon- 
Dictate, which starts out with a 
5,000-word vocabulary and a 
70,000-word dictionary- (used 
when DragonDictate doesn't 
recognize a word). As the 
system encounters new words, 
they're added to the 



vocabulary. 

For now, these systems 
are expensive — Voice Naviga- 
tor retails for about $ 1 ,000, 
and DragonDictate in beta 
form costs about $9,000. The 
technology is still being honed: 
You have to speak slowly to 
these devices, and you have to 
make sure that the machine 
has heard what you wanted it 
to hear. Computers can make 
typos with the best of us.

Real Computers Don't Say Hello 



When a computer plays a big 

role in a storj', ihe machine 
usually has a personality. 
Charming or threatening, pro- 
tective or hostiic, computer 
characters are more than wires 
and chips and electrical 
current. 

But when Speer Morgan 
wrote his latest novel, TheAs- 
K'lnbiers. he concentrated on 
excluding personality from his 
computer character. "I wanted 
the novel to be realistic," he 
said. 

The Assemblers, Morgan's 
third novel, is a thriller about 
an online auditing company in 
Arkansas. How can computer 
auditing be thrilling? .Add a 
few murders, a sinister satellite 
device of unknown origin, an 
estranged husband-and-wifc 
detective team, and money — a 
lot of money — and then see 
what you get. 

"I got resistance from all 



fronts about trying to be realis- 
tic," he said, explaining tech- 
nophobia as the cause of the 
crilicism. Editors said the 
computer character wasn't dra- 
matic enough and the story 
wasn't simple enough. 

"It's very difficult to make 
a computer a dramatic charac- 
ter. If it's just a machine that 
does your bidding, then it's ul- 
timately just a piece of furni- 
ture, dramatically. I gave the 
system what seems like voli- 
tion, but it's not real voli- 
tion — it's kind of a trick. 

Morgan isn't opposed to 
computers, but he is concerned 
about what we let computers 
do for us. about the threat to 
individual privacy, and about 
the electronic manipulation of 
wealth. "My book has a little 
bit of a 'Hey, wail a minute — 
let's think about some of the 
uses that we're willy-nilly get- 
ting into.' " 




Morgan teaches creative 
writing at the University of 
Missouri. He edits The Afis- 
souri Revie^y. a literary maga- 
zine published on paper and 



online through The Source. 

The Assemblers has been 
released in paperback by 
Worldwide Library.

The Blackboard Future 



John Sculley wants to arm 
educational revolutionaries, 
and he has already visualized 
the enlightening weapons of 
the twenty- first century. 

At a forum called Educa- 
tion for a Competitive Econo- 
my, Sculley addressed about 
1000 North Carolina business 
leaders and educators on ihe 
future of education in the 
United States. 

"Revolution is something 
that you do with passion, that 
you are inspired to do because 
you have hope for the future," 
he said. "And it is nothing 
short of revolution that is re- 
quired for our public educa- 
tion system." 

.After calling for drastic 
change, Sculley proceeded to 
show the audience what kind 
of tools should be available in 
the next century. He showed 
his well-known Knowledge 
Navigator, a booklike com- 
puter which accepts informal 
vocal commands and is linked 
to other resources around the 



^oUTKAiJ 




world. He also showed how 
the same kind of technology 
could help a child prepare a re- 
port for school. 

In the demonstration, the 
child gives a multimedia pre- 
sentation about volcanos, com- 
plete with graphics, text, sound, 
and film fooiage of an actual 
eruption. It's projected on 
what looks like a giant, bulletin- 



board-sized computer screen. 
The child's third-grade project 
is more sophisticated than pre- 
sentations most communica- 
tions professionals can create 
now with large budgets and ex- 
pensive equipment. 

Another incarnation of 
this future technology is a 
computerized book that teach- 
es an adult to read. A man sits 



on a park bench reading his 
computer book. When he 
comes to a word he doesn't 
know, he asks, "What's this 
word?" and the computer tells 
him. Best of all. he can scan 
text into the computer, choos- 
ing what he wants to read on 
the spur of the moment. 

.All of this impressive 
technology was produced with 
special effects for ScuUcy's pre- 
sentation, but he also showed 
current developments: inner- 
city classrooms equipped with 
Apple II's and Macintoshes, 
children who seem enthusias- 
tic about school work, and 
teachers describing themselves 
as guides. 

If Sculley has his way. 
school children will regard the 
computer as a backdrop for 
learning, not as a machine for 
programming: "When we think 
of the computer as a cultural 
tool, then we can perhaps un- 
derstand it better as a medium 
instead of a machine," he said.

ORSON SCOTT CARD 



T^ ouble Dragon (Arcadia). You're on 
m M assignment in the mean streets of a 
-M-^ city. You find weapons along the 
way — a knife, a baseball bat. oil cans, and 
boulders — that you can pick up and throw. 
You fight your way through an array of 
toughs — bad girls, hoodlums both black and 
white, even a not-so-jolly green giant. 

Into the Eagle's Nest (Mindscape). 
You're an American agent sent to infiltrate a 
Nazi stronghold. You pick up food, medi- 
cine, and ammunition along the way, trying 
to find and liberate prisoners held some- 
where in the fortress maze. 

Gauntlet (Mindscape). You are either a 
warrior, a Valkyrie, an elf, or a magician. 
You may be alone or with friends. You 
must penetrate an infinite underground 
maze, battling trolls, goblins, hobs, and wiz- 
ards as you search for treasure and magical 
objects. 

Impossible Mission II (Epyx). A mad 
scientist is set to blow up the world unless 
you penetrate his labyrinth and find the 
clues that will let you stop him. You are un- 
armed. You have to dodge the death-dealing 
robots or, occasionally, blow ihem up with 
mines you find along the way. 

Technocop (U.S. Gold). You start out in 
a supercar, eventually acquiring such acces- 
sories as turbospeed, rapid-fire cannons, 
even nukes. You end up inside inner-city 
tenements, shooting — or netting — not only 
the bad guy you've been sent to arrest, but 
also any other hoodlums you happen to 
meet along the way. 

These games are astonishingly similar. 
Each of the following statements is true of 
almost all of them: 

• Everybody you kill disappears. This is 
a programming necessity. Otherwise the 
screen would quickly fill up with the corpses 
of your victims. The vanishing-bodies syn- 
drome also has the pleasant effect of sanitiz- 
ing the game. There's no mess left behind 
you, nothing to explain or clean up. 

• You have to "tag up" on various 
items — treasure, food, ammunition, weap- 
ons, clues. 

• When you clear out all the bad guys on 
one level, you move on to the next, which is 
harder. The game ends only when you die. 

• Everybody you meet is out to kill you. 
No stranger can possibly be your friend. 

• The bad guys are all either nonhuman 
or clearly antisocial types, like punks or very 
large fat guys with no hair or poor inner-city 
blacks. The moral message is clear enough: 
It's OK to kill people that are different 



enough from you; people that are different 
from you are all out to kill you anyway. 
(Only Impossible Mission II makes a serious 
effort to avoid these moral problems — the 
bad guys are all machines.) 

• You've got to beat the clock. If you 
don't move forward through the obstacle 
course, you'll eventually die. There's no way 
to win without killing or blasting something. 

•Just as in bad TV shows, bad guys die 
easily and good guys keep coming back for 
more, at least for a while. Also, bad guys are 
stupid. This is a great thing for children to 
learn in preparation for life in the real worid. 

Now, some people will tell you (hat vio- 
lent games like this will desensitize you to 
real violence, making it seem more accept- 
able. Others will tell you that these games 
provide a harmless outlet for aggression and 
are no more violent than Road Runner 
cartoons. 

I, on the other hand, tell you that peo- 
ple play for their own reasons, and that 
games have different effects depending on 
the player. 

But nobody can deny that there's a bet- 
ter chance for Double Dragon to skew a 
player's moral outlook than, say. Breakout. 
Even among the games mentioned in this 
column. Double Dragon has disturbing ra- 
cial overtones, while Technocop is only mar- 
ginally better when it depicts the police 
officer's task as slaughter rather than crime 
prevention and investigation. Both are 
clearly more problematical than Gauntlet '% 
fantasy bad guys and Impossible Mission's 
nonhuman robot enemies. 

Unfortunately, a morally questionable 
game is often a lot more fun to play than a 
morally good one. For instance. Double 
Dragon is blessed with excellent graphics, an 
interesting setting, a full range of motion, 
and simple, clear controls. Gauntlet, on the 
other hand, is graphically pathetic, at least in 
the IBM version — the game on which I've 
spent $50 in a single day in the arcades isn't 
even worth putting up on the screen at 
home. Gauntlet and Impossible Mission II 
might be morally preferable, but which does 
my son — as nonviolent a kid as you'll ever 
meet — prefer to play? 

Game designers don't try to create mor- 
ally repulsive games. They're usually con- 
centrating on programming and design 
problems. Technocop's ingenious split 
screen is a triumph of clear visual game de- 
sign, with the lower half of the screen show- 
ing either the car's dashboard or the cop's 
wrist-computer display and the top half

Can't We Have

showing the action. While they were devel- 
oping this screen, I'm sure the designers 
weren't even thinking aboul killing. 

Lack of harmful intent may absolve 
them of guilt, but it doesn't clear them of re- 
sponsibility. That is, we mustn't brand these 
designers and programmers as bloodthirsty 
ogres. But we must remember that kids who 
act out the story contained in their game will 
be changed in some way by the experience. 
Games have consequences in the real world. 

So what is a designer supposed to do? 
Suppose we sanitized the concept of one of 
these idlling games. Let's say that as you 
move through the maze, lots of ugly worms 
and bugs come at you. You can't get past 
them in their bug form; you must shoot a 
metamorphosis pellet at them, turning them 
into butterflies or locusts, bri^t with color 
and life as they flutter or strut off the screen. 

Would the game still be a hit? 

Maybe, if it were designed with as 
much intelligence and visual artistry as the 
best of the killing games. But turning worms 
into butterflies would probably be viewed 
with disdain by the players who hunger for 
shoot-'em-ups. 

Why? Do these players just naturally 
love killing? 



The truth is, to the players — mostly 
children — these games aren't about killing. 
They don't know what death is. These 
games are power fantasies. If you're a kid, 
living a powerless life, it feels great to stride 
through a fantasy world where if anything 
blocks you, you can kick it out of your way. 
That's why this kind of game absolutely 
dominates in the arcades. That's why, in the 
days before computer games, kids played 
with army men or acted out cowboys and 
Indians. That's why my children made guns 
out of sticks or Legos despite our maintain- 
ing a weaponfree home. (And for those of 
you who think girls are immune, remember 
that playing with dolls is another manifesta- 
tion of power fantasies: all those lovely little 
people, always doing exactly what you want.) 

In other words, morally complex or 
mindlessly brutal, these games are what kids 
want — and will have, whether they play 
them on the computer or not. But that 
doesn't mean good game designers are ab- 
solved of responsibility. Can't they let us oc- 
casionally meet someone who isn't an 
enemy? Can't there be a few obstacles we 
can overcome without slaughter? Can't pow- 
er fantasies be accompanied by some sense 
ofrespect or compassion? Q

Programming 

Never Died — It 

Just Started 

Talking 

Another 

Language 



About ten years ago, one of the major 
debates among personal computers 
owners was whether or not wc were 
going to become a nation of programmers. 
There was almost no commercial software 
available for personal computers; each ma- 
chine came equipped with some version of 
BASIC, a programming language thai would 
(it was thought) make it possible for people 
to create ihcir own programs — if only they 
could learn to use it. 

It soon became evident that, given the 
choice, most computer users preferred buy- 
ing finished applications over creating their 
own. Programming became more of a hobby 
and less a computer survival skill. 

As the computer software market flour- 
ished, the number and scope of commercial- 
ly available computer programs grew so 
quickly that most computer users were able 
to find exactly what they wanted. There was 
no need to personally program their person- 
al computers. Computer literacy, once de- 
fined as the ability to create programs from 
scratch, became the ability to use a com- 
puter, period. 

But even with these developments, the 
computer's unique potential to be custom- 
ized to meet specific needs was too powerful 
to ignore — the programming movement 
took a subversive turn. With programs like 
VisiCalc and other spreadsheet tools, per- 
sonal computer users were able to create 
customized applications of their own by 
building templates. And though creating a 
template is different from creating a com- 
puter program from scratch, the result is the 
same: a customized program designed to 
meet one unique need. 

Tools that allow for template creation 
are typically far easier to master than tradi- 
tional programming languages. The core 
program (a spreadsheet or database, for ex- 
ample) provides the framework. Within the 
constraints of this framework, you can craft 
a specific application using a compact set of 
commands whose meaning is easy to grasp 
and whose grammar is fairly obvious. The 
success of this approach can be seen in the 
overwhelming popularity of database and 
spreadsheet programs. Executives and sup- 
port staff who would never think of them- 
selves as computer programmers are able to 
create custom templates for their work as 
easily as they use any other program on their 
computers. 

But there is a price to be paid for this 
ease of use: While it's easy to create tem- 
plates for a wide variety of applications, it's 
virtually impossible to create templates that 



move the application ver\' far from the un- 
derlying metaphor. In other words, applica- 
tions built with a spreadsheet tool look like 
spreadsheets. You wouldn't design a video- 
game using Lotus 1-2-3. 

Such constraints, however, may not be 
the last word in creating easy-to-use pro- 
gramming tools. A relatively new class of 
programming languages built on the concept 
of objects has started showing up at the con- 
sumer level. The most popular of these at 
this time is HyperCard for the Apple Macin- 
tosh computer. 

Through the use of an English-like 
scripting language (called HyperTalk), 
HyperCard users assign tasks to such ob- 
jects as buttons and fields. Each instance of 
an object can perform a specific task and 
can be tested and refined (usually) as though 
it were independent from the rest of the pro- 
gram. The ability to construct a large appli- 
cation from such simple building blocks 
makes programming in HyperCard far more 
intuitive and easy than working with more 
traditional languages like C. Pascal, or 
FORTH. 

HyperCard users can start with an ap- 
plication that performs some of what's re- 
quired and then can add features to 
customize the program to specific needs. 
Programming in this environment is like 
building a structure with Tinker Toys: You 
can remove or add pieces at will until the 
desired structure is completed. 

HyperCard has been available for a 
while, and we now have enough data to 
suggest that this type of environment will 
bring most of the advantages of program- 
ming to the many millions of computer 
users who want to create the occasional cus- 
tom application. Several other vendors have 
since claimed to have created versions for 
other computers. To date, none of these 
HyperCard-Wkc products supports the flexi- 
bility of the HyperTalk scripting language. 
While these tools do allow the creation of 
customized applications, they lack the tre- 
mendous freedom offered by the original 
product. 

It appears that we want to be program- 
mers after all. The industrv' is responding by 
providing us with tools that take the pain 
out of the process. If you've wanted to create 
a program of your own but haven't wanted 
to spend a year learning a formal program- 
ming language, you should explore some of 
the other tools available to you. You just 
might write a program that increases the 
power of your computer beyond your wild- 
est dreams. a

More 'Miga 

On the "COMPUTE! Reader Survey," 
(February 1989), I found it difficult to 
choose only two parts of the magazine 
that I like the best. This is because I like 
most of the features and articles that 
you print! Since I have an Amiga 2000, 
the Amiga-pertinent items are most in- 
teresting to me. But I also find the ge- 
neric articles helpful. For example, the 
articles "Money, Money, Money" and 
"Money and Your Spreadsheet," even 
though they gave me more insight into 
money management and spreadsheets 
in general. Your series on "The Ele- 
mentary Amiga" early in 1 988 is anoth- 
er example of the good stuff I have 
found in COMPUTE!. How about a 
similar series about the new Work- 
bench 1 .3? That would be great for me 
and the other Amiga owners who read 
COMPUTE!.

Not So Choice 

In "The 1989 COMPUTE! Choice 
Awards" (January 1989), 1 was very in- 
terested in reading about Muliiplan. I 
certainly agree with everything you said 
about the program and its features. 
However, without cooperation from the 
company who sells it and furnishes sup- 
port for it, sometimes the program be- 
comes useless. 

I wrote to Microsoft regarding a 
problem I have with the program. On 
page 0-31 of the manual, it says: "Your 
Muliiplan Program diskette is set up so 
that only one copy of the Muliiplan 
Program diskette can be made to a 
backup diskette and only one copy to a 
fixed disk, if you have a fixed disk," I 
interpret the anrfas meaning that I can 
have two copies. One for a diskette and 
one for a hard disk. When 1 attempted 
to put my Muliiplan program on my 
new hard disk, I got a message that 
seemed to say that I couldn't make a 
copy. 

1 have never received a written an- 
swer to my letter, but on January 10, 
1989, 1 received a telephone call from a 
young man who told me that the mes- 
sage I was getting was the copy-protect 
message, and I could not put the pro- 



gram onto my hard disk. "Sorry it look 
so long to get back to you, goodbye." 

Now you know that, as I look 

around for a new spreadsheet program 

for my hard disk, I will not be looking 

at any of those produced by Microsoft,

Algebraic Searcli 

1 have been unable to find an educa- 
tional program for high school Algebra 
I. Everywhere I've checked has them 
for PCs but not for Macs. Any help in 
this matter will be greatly appreciated. 
David Franklin 
Butner, NC 

Try contacting True Basic at 45 Theo- 
dore Fremd A venue, Rye, New York 
10580. That company sells a Macintosh 
package called Algebra, which should be 
appropriate for a beginning student. 

A Better Mix 

The article "Coming Together" in the 

March 1989 issue of COA/PLTE.' failed 
to mention a very important aspect of 
interfacing an Atari ST with a PC com- 
patible. Sure, pcDitto will turn your ST 
into an IBM clone, but the ST will also 
directly read IBM PC-format disks! 
This makes file transfers painless. 
(Note: Because of a slight difference in 
the way the disks are formatted, an 
IBM compatible cannot read an ST 
disk.) 

I use both an Atari ST and a PC- 
compatible laptop. The laptop utilizes 
two 3'/2-inch disk drives. Most pro- 
grams are still distributed on S'/i-inch 
disks, so I use the ST equipped with a 
5 '/4-inch l.B. Drive to transfer the pro- 
grams to the smaller disk format. 

I also use the ST setup to transfer 
program files from Personal Pascal (ST) 
to Turbo Pascal (IBM). With modifica- 
tion, the program is ready to run. In 
fact, I prefer editing program files for 
Turbo Pascal using the Personal Pascal 
program editor, even though it requires 
swapping computers to compile and 
link.

Computer, Fetch 

What's happening? Just when you 
think it's safe to buy a computer, poof, 
it becomes a closet computer (COM- 
PUTE!. October 1988). Eight-bit is out; 
16-bit is in. 

I purchased an Atari 1 30XE four 
years ago, and no sooner did I get it fig- 
ured out than your magazine suggests 
how I can make a pet out of my 
computer. 

Is there no plateau where the old

64 Solution 

I thought "Editorial License" was very 
good in the February 1 989 issue of 
COMPUTE! magazine. It hits the com- 
puter on the head about pricing for 
home computers. However, there is one 
alternative. One can purchase a Com- 
modore 64 with a 1541 disk drive for 
about $300. A Star NX- 1000 printer 
costs S 1 60. An interface for the printer 



can be had for $40. GEOS comes with 
the disk drive. There are many good 
public domain programs. One can even 
type in a good word processor from a 
previous issue of COMPUTE! 's Ga- 
zette. That's $500 for a complete com- 
puter with a good printer, several fonts, 
and near-letter-quality output. Too bad 
someone like K mart doesn't package 
something like this with good infor- 
mation to get someone going. Also, 
with user groups, it is fairly easy to 
get help. 

The 64 is not just a game machine 
but, packaged correctly, would be a 
home machine of several genres.

Virus Vindication 

In the March 1989 "Impact," David 
Thornburg suggests that computer vi- 
ruses come under the Fourth Amend- 
ment of the Constitution and are 
therefore a federal offense. It is my im- 
pression that spreading viruses is a fed- 



eral offense, especially if they cross state 
lines. But this does not come under the 
Fourth Amendment of the Constitu- 
tion. The Fourth Amendment protects 
us from unreasonable searches and 
seizures by state, local, and federal gov- 
ernment. The laws against breaking and 
entering and theft protect us against un- 
reasonable searches and seizures by in- 
dividuals. Spreading computer viruses 
probably comes under vandalism or 
malicious mischief 

Will the threat of jail or fines dis- 
courage those who spread viruses? 
Probably. The average computer nerd 
would not do very well in jail. Even 
heavy fines or the threat of a lawsuit 
could be effective. Nothing is perfect, 
but this strikes me as the type of crime 
that punishment can deter. 

Richard Bruce

David Thornburg heartily agrees with 
Bruce's statements about the Fourth 
Amendment and is glad that Bnice took 
such an interest in the issue, s

What's It 

Going to Be? 

Rigid 

Computer 

Learning or 

Electronic, 

Seat-of-the- 

Pants 

Exploration? 



A few years ago, I attended a prescnta- 
lion sponsored by a leading packager 
of computer-managed instruction 
(CMI) systems. For $32,000 a year, the pre- 
senter said, schools could lease a network of 
eight dumb terminals. Those terminals would 
be linked to a mainframe in a nearby city. 
Containing hundreds of neatly organized 
education modules, that mainframe could 
track each student's educational progress 
and deliver to each just the right dose of 
math or language arts or science every day. 

"At first glance, the cost might seem a 
bit high." the presenter admitted. He went 
on to explain, however, that careful plan- 
ning could make the system quite cost- 
effective. With proper scheduling and rigid 
adherence to that schedule, the total cost per 
student hour wasn't bad at all, he assured us. 

Besides, the system offered many ad- 
vantages over what he apparently viewed as 
the haphazard education normally provided 
in traditional classrooms. With his CMI sys- 
tem, each student could work at his or her 
own pace. During each 20-minute session, 
every student would receive a perfectly bal- 
anced diet of 25-percent new material. 50- 
percenl medium-difficulty review items, 
and 25-percent easy review questions. 

No one could loaf either. If a child 
"wasted" more than a few seconds, the digi- 
tal instructor would lake note, later report- 
ing the miscreant's sloth along with page 
after page of equally useful data. 

The administrators in attendance 
smiled approvingly as the presenter ex- 
plained how much paperwork the system 
could generate — individual progress reports, 
student-to-studcnt analogies, teacher-to- 
teacher comparisons. Everithing neat and 
clean. E^■e^ything indelibly recorded in a 
huge database somewhere. 

The demonstrator beamed with pride 
as he showed us his software. I cringed. Dry 
drill-and-practicc stuff. (Drill and practice is 
a necessary part of the learning process, but 
need it be so dull?) While the presenter read 
his statistics. I envisioned students working 
day after tedious day on such drivel. "Stu- 
dents using this program in District Y ad- 
vanced one and one-half grade levels in one 
school year!" he exuded. Research had 
shown that his system significantly im- 
proved standardized test scores. 

He mentioned several area schools that 
already were using the system. Others would 
sign on following that presentation. After all, 
the local cost wasn't so bad when adjusted 
for state aid, divided by student enrollment. 



and square-rooted by minutes of actual on- 
line instructional time (or something like 
that — the math eluded me). 

My mind wandered. "How many com- 
puters could S 32,000 buy? Must computer- 
based instruction be so intolerably dull? 
Couldn't students learn just as well with a 
less structured, more flexible approach?" 

I imagined kids plugging along day after 
day, improving their standardized test 
scores and learning to hate learning. It 
didn't seem right. Yet arguing against such 
apparent progress was, and still is, a risky 
business. There's something reassuring 
about cold, hard statistics. A smile, a laugh, 
and an inquisitive mind are much more dif- 
ficult to measure and quantify'. 

Anyway, our district passed on the 
dumb-terminal network. We'll never know 
the effect of that decision on lest scores. We 
do know our microcomputer lab is always 
filled with eager, smiling kids. 

Whether they're used to encourage indi- 
vidual exploration and discovery or to stuff 
ever-increasing volumes of facts into reluc- 
tant minds, computers do work as educa- 
tional tools. Perhaps this fact more than any 
other should force us as educators and par- 
ents to more carefully analyze our attitudes 
toward education — what it is and what we 
expect from it. 

How shall we use the power of comput- 
ers? Should we use technology to deliver a 
standardized curriculum to every school in 
the country? With such an approach, we 
could be reasonably certain that even' child 
in the nation would know Peari Harbor Day 
was in December, not September. Or should 
we use computers to encourage creativity 
and individual thought and run the risk of 
falling behind in the statistics game? 

For my part. I hope the day never 
comes when we begin packaging education 
like it's breakfast cereal — minimum daily 
requirements, perfectly balanced diets, nev- 
er too little, never too much — with a neurot- 
ic fixation on subject matter oblivious to the 
humanity of teachers and learners. 

The real value of educational comput- 
ing does not lie in its ability to force-feed 
facts. The real value lies in the computer's 
ability to encourage creativity, facilitate per- 
sonal exploration, and give students, par- 
ents, and teachers greater — not less — 
control of the educational process. That's 
the strength of educational computing, and 
that's why we will see increasing benefits as 
more and more people join the computer 
revolution in schools and at home. Q

' hat could be better than a dog? 

Computers, of course. Granted, they aren't as loyal 
or as fun to pet, but they're still capable of doing 
tricks. And unlike your canine pets, computers are a 
lot easier to train. 

Training a computer to do something is commonly referred 
to as programming. It's a big, scary term. Actually, programming 
a computer is almost as easy as using a computer. In some in- 
stances it's easier, because you're telling the computer exactly 
what you want it to do. 

If you've ever felt frustration with some of the programs you 
use, then you're ready to program. As programmer John Ratcliff 
puts it, "I bought computer games and felt really disappointed — 
like I was being ripped off. I said, 'I can do better than this.' " 
And he did. John is the author of Electronic Arts' 688 Attack Sub 
game for the IBM PC. If you know programming, then you can 
do just as John did. 

You may have a problem, though — knowing where to start. 
Programming sounds complex. It looks even more complex. Face 
it, some programs look like the work of a Navaho rug maker. 
Maybe you're afraid of programming's complexity, or maybe 
you're afraid that you need to know mountains of algebra to pro- 
gram. Don't worry. It's not true. 

You don't need to be a genius in math to program. You 
don't even need to know how to type. All it takes is a computer, 
a little time, and some creativity. John Ratcliff comments, "If you 



20 C O M P U T E I 




own your own computer and have free time, you have the right 
ingredients." 

But is programming something you can do? Bruce Webster — 
author of The NExT Book, from Addison-Wesley, and programmer/ 
creator of the game Sundog — has taught a lot of people how to 
program. Bruce has noticed that the people who do well are also 
good with story problems. "The ability to take a verbal descrip- 
tion of a problem and then extract from it the information nec- 
essary to arrive at a solution is the essence of programming." 

One thing that might come in handy is some artistic or musi- 
cal talent. For some reason, musicians make better programmers 
than, say, mathematicians. Programming, like making music, is 
taking an intangible idea and making it real. Tony Garcia, assis- 
tant acquisitions manager for Epyx, a software publisher, says, 
"People who are into programming are into keyboard in- 
struments. A lot of computer programmers like to do a lot of 
drawing and doodling. Programmers get a kick out of creating art 
with a PC." 

But even if you're not a musician, don't give up hope. This 
article will introduce you to a skill that could change your life: 
programming your personal computer. As painlessly as possible, 
ril introduce you to computer programming, the various 
programming languages, and how you should learn this poten- 
tially profitable hobby. And through candid comments from 
programming experts and learned individuals, you'll discover how 
to profit from teaching your computer a few new tricks. 



Helilloooo, Computer 
Programming! 

Programming as a hobby is relatively 
new; it's been around only ten years or 
so. Before that, it wasn't a hobby — it 
was a job. But with the advent of per- 
sonal computers, programming has be- 
come a pastime for millions. Bruce 
Webster notes, "There are a lot of pro- 
grammers out there. No one ever fore- 
saw that Borland would sell I million 
copies of Turbo Pascal. That's a lot of 
people out there hacking away;" So 
why not join the crowd? 

By learning how to program your 
computer, you learn more about your 
computer. The more you learn about 
your computer, the more you'll get out 
of it. The programs you write can do 
things for you — in some cases, things 
that other programs can't (because 
only you know what you need). And 
then there's always the possibility that 
you'll sell your creations and make 
some money — maybe even incredible 
sums of money. 

All of this starts when you learn 
about computer programming. 

Computer What? 

When you program, you give the com- 
puter a series of instructions, or steps, 
that it must follow. The computer fol- 
lows those instructions to the letter 
(unlike your dog, the computer is very 
obedient). If you tell the computer, 
"Run around in a circle," it will do so. 
Forever. Or until you tell it to stop. 

Programming is also just a fancy 
term for human/computer commu- 
nications. To tell the computer to do 
something, you need to speak to it in 
a language it can understand — a 
programming language. You can't just 
say, "Computer, make me a piece of 
toast." It would be nice, and someday 
it may work. But not now. Instead, 
you can use one of the many common 
computer programming languages. 

Programming languages are the 
dialects we humans use to commu- 
nicate with our computers. For cul- 
tural and social reasons, we commu- 
nicate using speech. Computers, 
though, communicate using numbers. 
Those numbers are the infamous Is 
and Os you've probably read about 
and feared. Fortunately, computer pro- 



M A Y 19 8 9 21 



gramming languages make it possible 
for you to tell your computer what to 
do without uttering a single 1 or 0. 

Programming languages come in 
varying degrees of sophistication. 
There arc three levels: high, medium, 
and low. A high-level language uses 
command names and a structure that's 
fairly close to English. A low-level 
programming language more closely 
resembles a poetic column of three- 
letter acronyms and is but a hairs- 
breadth away from Is and Os. A mid- 
level language is somewhere in 
between. 

If you're just starting to program, 
you'll probably want to pick an easy, 
high-level language — one in which you 
can use familiar. English-language ex- 
pressions to tell your computer what 
to do. Programming statements such 
as S.AVE FILE TO DISK or ADD 7 
TO RESULT are common in high- 
level languages. To get started, you 
simply need to know the programming 
commands (vocabulary) and the lan- 
guage's syntax (the order of the 
words). 

.A programming language's 
vocabulary is never very large: The 
BASIC programming language has 
only 140 or so "words." for instance. 
(Compare that to the 15,000 or so 
English words you know, and BASIC'S 
command list seems puny.) Learning a 
programming language's syntax, how- 
ever, takes time and practice. In fact, 
forgetting a language's syntax (source 
of the programmer's bane, the dreaded 
syntax error) is a common mistake. A 
missing apostrophe, semicolon, or 
period can spell doom for even the 
best program. 

Once you've mastered the com- 
mands and the syntax, the rest is just 
learning through practice. Computers 
won't blow up when you make a pro- 
gramming mistake. In fact, some pro- 
gramming languages even show you 
where you've made your mistake and 
offer corrections. 



How Many Languages Are Enough? 

It's nice if you speak a smattering of this or that programming language, just enough 
maybe to read a section of code and decipher what's going on. But how many lan- 
guages do you really need to know? 

If you're a typical programmer, you'll probably become welt-versed in at least 
three — possibly more, if you count the myriad of spreadsheet languages, batch lan- 
guages, communications macro languages, and what have you. 

Here are several other popular languages. 

Prolog 

Prolog stands for Programmal/on en logiqiue (programming In logic) and is perhaps tiie 
most unconventional programming language. 

Prolog is very easy to learn — provided you haven't learned any other programming 
languages. This is because Prolog is declarative, not procedural. You describe what you 
want Prolog to do by giving it a set of facts, rules, relations, and queries— as opposed 
to telling it, "Do steps A, B, C, then D." Prolog works like a database, examining the 
information, then quickly coming up with a solution. 

Prolog is best for expert systems, theorem proving, language analysis, and pattern 
matching. It's good at looking at problems and quickly coming up with solutions. Prolog 
programs are also capable of rewriting themselves while they run. 

On the downside, Prolog doesn't handle a lot of algorithms as well as the pro- 
cedural languages do. It's also rare to find a job as a Prolog programmer. 

Lisp 

Lisp stands for Lis? processing, though if you've ever seen some Lisp code, you might 
have thought it was an acronym for Lots of Insidious Silly Parentheses. On the historical 
side, Lisp is the second oldest programming language (next to Fortran). 

Lisp is easy to learn and easy to modify, and it has an incredible support environ- 
ment, including the famous Programmer's Apprentice, which actually writes subroutines 
for you. With those tools, Lisp is the test general-purpose language on the market. 

Lisp's major drawbacl< is its lack of support in the nonacademic computer commu- 
nity (not to mention the awkward looks you encounter when you say that you "speak 
Lisp" to your computer). There are few Lisp program listings; good luck finding tutorials 
in magazines. 

For microcomputer users, the full Lisp environment is expensive. Expect to pay 
around $1,000. Even then, you probably won't be getting some of the support tools. 

Fortran 

The oldest computer language, Fortran — which stands for formula translator — is good 
for scientific and engineering programming. Every engineer who uses a computer knows 
Fortran. (And practically all engineering problems have Fortran programs as solutions.) 

Fortran is not swift at dealing with strings. And don't expect employers to knock 
down your door when they find out you speak Fortran. File processing in Fortran is al- 
most like a spell incantation. 

COBOL 

tXiBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) is used by the government and big 
business. Even though it's one of the older computer languages, there's still a need for 
COBOL programmers. Rumor has it that more source code is written in COBOL than in 
any other language. 

COBOL is good at txjth file and data processing, and it handles text well, which is 
probably why COBOL has tjeen more popular than Fortran. It uses a very wordy, 
English-like syntax. COBOL also sports a large vocabulary, about 300 words— more 
than any other programming language. 

COBOL's major drawback is a lack of decent loop commands. It's also severely 
structured. There aren't very many interactive features in COBOL. 

Ada 

Ada is a modern programming language specifically designed to meet certain U.S. gov- 
ernment specifications. It's named after the Countess of Lovelace, Augusta Ada Byron, 
who was Lord Byron's daughter and a friend of Blaise Pascal. 

Ada is good to know if you want a job in certain branches of the government and 
the military. Missile-control and -guidance systems are written in Ada, which is good be- 
cause Ada is said to be one of the most reliable languages. (The Libyans must write 
their missile-guidance systems in LOGO.) 

The flip side of the coin is that Ada is bulky and slow. Though you can buy Ada 
compilers for your microcomputer, it's not really a microcomputer programming 
language.

COMPUTE! 




A Lot of Languages 

It would be nice if there were only one 
computer language, just as it would be 
nice if there were a universal spoken 
language. But since it doesn't pay to 
dwell on what is not, let's see what 
traits programming languages do share. 

Computer languages are alike in 
that they all let you give the computer 
instructions. But it's not all instruc- 
tions, or commands. Instead, there are 
some math and decision-making pro- 
cesses involved. (Don't panic! The 
math here is not that hard. As far as 
you're concerned, the math in a com- 
puter programming language is an 
extension of the basic functions you'll 
find on a calculator.) 

Besides commands and the math, 
two other items common to nearly 
every programming language are vari- 
ables and control structures. 

A computer variable is the same 
kind of variable that you encountered 
in junior high algebra: It's a place 
where the programming language 
stores a value (number) or string 
(characters or text). The contents of 
the variable can be manipulated. So, 
as the name says, variables vary. You 
assign them values, or you can 
manipulate the values once they've 
been assigned. 

Control structures are also com- 
mon to all programming languages. 
There are two types: the decision and 
the loop. 

A decision structure usually in- 
volves some type of "if comparison. 
IF X = 3 THEN BEEP is a good ex- 
ample. This type of control structure 
provides the computer with its 
processing power, allowing it to seem- 
ingly make decisions based on what 
you tell it. 

The second type of control struc- 
ture is the loop, a series of program- 
ming statements that execute over and 
over. These statements can go on for- 
ever if you like (the infamous endless 
loop), or you can supply a condition 



whereby the loop stops. Because most 
of the stuff computers do is repetitive, 
it's a good sign if a programming lan- 
guage has a wide variety of looping 
structures. 

Choosing a Language 

There are four very common program- 



ming languages for personal comput- 
ers. You'll probably start learning to 
program with one of these four and 
then move on to something more 
sophisticated or specialized. But just 
about everyone starts with BASIC, 
Pascal, or C. The fourth common lan- 
guage, assembly language, is a little too 



Help! 



Writing programs is like any creative exercise. (I'm from the school that preaches 
programming as an art form, not a science.) Whether you're carving wood, writing a 
symphony, or letting your emotions run wild with a brush and some oils, you'll need 
more than just the basic tools. Same thing with programming. 

Consider programming as working at a workbench (the computer is the work- 
bench). Your primary tools are the programming language and your brain. Alone, these 
two can get the job done, but you'll find yourself doing a lot of repetitive maintenance 
tasks between major accomplishments. 

To make the job easier, look into some programming utilities. These are small, one- 
purpose programs that will assist you in your programming duties. They make life easier 
for the programmer, which is why utilities proliferate and why programmers love them 
so much. 

The primary utility you'll use is a text editor. Even if your programming language 
comes with its own editor, find a full-featured text editor. 

The most popular text editor of all time is WordStar (the old version, not the new, 
perversion). The WordStar-like editor in SideKick is also preferred by many PC pro- 
grammers. A fantastic text editor called Brief (from Solution Systems) was written 
specifically with programming In mind. Vq (from Golden Bow Systems) is similar to Brief 
but adds powerful disk-search features. These two packages may seem a little pricey to 
some beginners (upwards of $200 each). In that case, there are many inexpensive 
(around $50) text editors that will get the job done. 

Aside from a good text editor, other tools or utilities you'll want to have include a 
debugger, the GREP utility, a file finder, a keyboard-macro programmer, and a pro- 
grammer's calculator. 

A debugger is the ultimate programming tool. It lets you look at your code after it's 
been compiled or assembled into a finished program. You can "walk through" your pro- 
gram a step at a time, examining how variables change and how the program, changes 
memory and manipulates the computer. The debugger is the best way lo kill those hard- 
to-find bugs. 

MS-DOS comes with a simple debugger called DEBUG. DEBUG is good for getting 
started and for examining memory. But its walk-through, or tracing, functions are prim- 
itive and of use to only the most well-versed assembly language programmers. On the 
commercial side, Microsoft markets CodeView and Borland puts out Turbo Debugger, 
both of which offer power and features beyond DEBUG 's. 

Some other utilities you might want to check out including the following: 

GREP 

A povrerful file-searching utility, GREP is able to locate a string of text in any number of 
files. There are public domain versions of GREP for just about every computer, and 
Boriand puts out a fast version called Turbo GREP with its Turbo C package. (Trivia 
buffs shoukl know that GREP stands for Gfobal/Regular Expression/Prim. Ah, science ) 

LIST 

LIST is a shareware program that replaces the DOS TYPE command. It's ideal for view- 
ing and searching through text files on disk. 

FF or WHEREIS 

Both of these utilities are good for locating a lost file on disk. FF Is part of Norton Util- 
ities and WHEREiS is a shareware program. 

Pro Key or SuperKey 

These are keyboard-macro programs that save you repetitive typing. SuperKey also lets 
you encrypt files. 

You might also look into a pop-up programmer's calculator that can assist you in 
translating between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal number bases. Both PC Tools and 
SideKick have pop-up calculators: I prefer SideKlck's.

much to chew for your first stab at 
programming. 

Read on for overv'iews of these 
popular programming languages; the 
summaries offer opinions as to 
strengths and weaknesses and include 
an expert's advice on each language. 

BASIC 

BASIC is the first language for about 
90 percent of all programmers. Why? 
Because it's very easy to learn. Also, 
as Tony Garcia, Epyx's assistant ac- 
quisitions manager, points out, 
"BASIC usually comes with the com- 
puter you buy," He adds. "BASIC'S 
instructions are easily mastered." 

BASIC, an acronym for Begin- 
ner's .A.ll-purposc Symbolic Instruction 
Code, was developed at Dartmouth 
College in the 1960s to teach program- 
ming to business and other non- 
science majors. Due to the efforts of 
Bill Gates at Microsoft, B.A.SIC even- 
tually became the de facto language for 
all microcomputers. In fact, because of 
its popularity on microcomputers, 
probably more programs are written in 
BASIC than in any other computer 
language. 

BASIC is a good, general-purpose 
language. It's not too sophisticated, yet 
it's capable of performing just about 
any imaginable feat. Thanks to 
Microsoft. B.A^SIC now contains tons 
of sound-and-graphics routines, mak- 
ing it suitable for just about anything. 

B.4SIC is best at siring han- 
dling — the ability to manipulate text. 
(Other programming languages really 
balk at the idea of dealing with text.) 
BASIC is not really bad at anything. 
However, its lack of a well-defined 
structure can make for sloppy code. 
"I've seen people who start with 
BASIC and develop almost irrevers- 
ible bad habits," comments pro- 
fessional programmer Bruce Webster, 
a self-admitted Pascal fan. 

Pascal 

Pascal was created to help teach stu- 



dents computer programming. It 
solved most of the problems asso- 
ciated with B.ASIC — primarily BA- 
SIC'S lack of Structure. Pascal is ver>' 
structured, which makes it an excellent 
first programming language. 

Pascal, named after the French 
mathematician Blaise Pascal, is a 
good, general-purpose language, .^bout 
the only thing it does poorly is siring 
handling. Other than that. Pascal can 
get just about any job done. 

Bruce Webster is a Pascal enthu- 
siast who has taught the language to 
hundreds of students at Brigham 
Young University. "I really think Pas- 
cal is the best initial programming lan- 
guage. It teaches you good concepts 
and good habits. When you know Pas- 
cal, it's easy to move on to other lan- 
guages when you're ready. And you 
take the good habits you learned along 
with you." 

Morgan Davis, creator of the pro- 
grams Proline and MouscTalk and co- 
author of the book Mastering the 
Apple IIgs Toolbox, disagrees with 
Webster. "Writing a program in Pascal 
is like having a mother hen hovering 
over you. watching your every move, 
making sure you don't screw up. For 
example, C assumes you know what 
you're doing, whereas Pascal puts all 
these restrictions on you." 

Over the years, the original Pascal 
language has been modified to deal 
with some of its shortcomings. Hard- 
core Pascal programmers would prob- 
ably blame Boriand for most of these 
modifications. The company's Turbo 
Pascal added numerous extensions to 
Pascal and provided the language with 
the consistency and punch it was 
lacking. 



C is the ultimate computer language. 
This is by way of acclamation more 
than by any official labeling. All the 
experts agree on this one. 

Morgan Davis says, "C is one of 
the best and most flexible languages 
around," John Ratcliff, programmer of 
688 Attack Sub, comments, "The 
whole world is going to C," Tony Gar- 
cia puts it best when he says, "The 
hottest language is C. It's an interest- 
ing language that allows porting over 



to another machine. For example, you 
can lake the C code that you did on 
one computer and move it over to an- 
other computer, changing only the ma- 
chine-specific information. C is what 
everyone is learning." 

Unlike BASIC or Pascal. C is a 
mid-level language. It's not quite as 
English-like as either BASIC or Pascal, 
but it's still well above the grunts and 
squawks of assembly language. Today 
almost all the major software applica- 
tions are written in C. .And if you plan 
on writing programs for the UNIX or 
OS/2 operating systems, learn C. Sun- 
dog creator Bruce Webster agrees. 
"If you're interested in a job, learn 
C. Learn Pascal first for good pro- 
gramming techniques and then switch 
to C." 

For all its strengths, however, C 
isn't a good first computer language. If 
you want to learn C, study Pascal or 
B.4SIC first. .After that, C comes natu- 
rally (more or less). 



Assembly 



,A.ssembly language is but one notch 
above the Is and Os, the machine lan- 
guage that your computer's micro- 
processor speaks. But rather than 
using numbers, assembly language 
uses two- to five-letter mnemonics to 
represent the programming instruc- 
tions understood by your computer's 
microprocessor. 

There isn't just one assembly lan- 
guage. Instead, there are several, one 
for each microprocessor. There is 8086 
assembly language for IBM PCs and 
compatibles; 68000 assembly language 
for the Macintosh, Atari ST, and 
.Amiga; and 6502 assembly language 
for the Commodore 64 and .Apple II 
computers, ,A11 assembly languages are 
similar in concept, and if you learn 
one, picking up another isn't hard. 

Assembly is the hardest program- 
ming language to learn because it's so 
far removed from the way humans 
think. Once you understand the basic 
concepts and realize that you're work- 
ing directly with your computer's 
microprocessor and memory, though, 
assembly can be fun. 

Because assembly is so close to 
the machine language your computer

naturally speaks, the programs you 
write will run faster than programs 
written in any other language. "If 
you're going to write a professional 
computer game, you're going to have 
to write il in assembly language," says 
John RatclifF. 



The downside of fast assembly 
language programs is that it takes ten 
limes longer to write an assembly lan- 
guage program than it would take to 
write a program using another lan- 
guage. Why? Because with assembly 
language you're working from the 
ground up. You, the programmer, 
write the math and savc-to-disk 
routines. Sure, you'll gel some help 
from some prewritten routines inside 
the computer's ROM and from DOS, 
but not much. 

Lately, the feeling among 



Make Money Programming 



Why hide your programming gems? If you like the programs you write, someone else 
probably will, too. So why not sell your work? 

The problem with selling your programs is finding people to buy them. Having a 
good product is only half ttie battle. Getting that product to the marketplace is where 
most programmers fall short. Fortunately, there are things you can do to get an edge on 
thie competition. 

Once your program is ready to go (certainly a relative term in the software biz), 
there are ways to market it Sell to a commercial publisher or market the program 
yourself. 

Selling to a commercial publisher isn't as easy as it used to be. Notes Sundog au- 
thor Bruce Webster, "The software market is very competitive. Budding programmers 
are going to have a hard time competing. Companies are pouring millions of dollars into 
software development." But Bruce wants you to take fneart. "If you're serious and have 
something that's hot, the best thing to do is to find a software house to market it. Find a 
small software company. If you go to a large house, you're going to have a tot of people 
ahead of you." 

Tony Garcia looks through piles of program submissions every day as part of his 
job as assistant acquisitions manager at Epyx. He suggests that potential software au- 
thors submit a good, professional presentation— not necessarily a finished product, but 
something that has a nicely detailed write-up. To those new to programming, he recom- 
mends, "Let the publisher know it's your first project. Most people feel intimidaled when 
sending out their first project. It's important to let the publisher know that" 

An example of one who succeeded, John Ratcliff, who sold his 688 Attack Sub 
simulation to Electronic Arts, recommends that would-be software autfiors put a lot of 
energy into their product. "Finish a great amount of the software to prove that you can 
do it. That means a lot to the industry." 

N/larketing the software yourself is the hardest road. Ratcliff recommends that every 
budding programmer write shareware (software that you distribute (or free and then 
hope the users pay a registration fee for at some later date). "It's a great way to experi- 
ment. You're not going to make any money, but your name gets around." 

Morgan Davis, who has been running a shareware business for four years, agrees. 
"If you have a decerrt product, but you're a small-time developer, sharevrare is a great 
outlet," says Davis. "Once your shareware has been out and around, approach a real 
software house and see if they want to pick it up. The fact that you're getting exposure 
can open up other doors." 

But actually making money with shareware is hard. "A few people have done very 
well with shareware. Most have done pooriy," comments Bruce Webster. "It's a very 
easy way to put your stuff out and get feedback, but not a good way to make a living — 
except for a few." 

Generally speaking, shareware doesn't work. Only a small percentage of people 
turn In the fee. "I get a $10 check in the mail every few months or so and people send 
me nice letters: No one pays for it, but they all know about it," says John Ratcliff. 

Neariy all the experts agree that shareware is the best way to get your name out 
there and knovm. "It's a great way to get your work out and be recognized by the 
community," comments Tony Garcia. "The concept is great and I'd like to see more 
sucxess from il. It gives any programmer a lot of visibility." 



programming professionals is that you 
should learn and use C for most of 
your programming. According to these 
experts, assembly is only appropriate 
for rewriting those parts of a program 
which are running too slowly. (Assem- 
bly language can be merged with most 
other languages for speed optimiza- 
tion.) In other words, knowing a 
smattering of assembly never hurts. 



Where to Begin? 



Now the questions really start. Where 
should you go to learn and study? 
What about that Great American Pro- 
gram you want to write? 

Your first job in learning a 
programming language is to pick one. 
After that, there arc two directions you 
can take: self teaching or formal 
instruction. On these two methods, the 
experts disagree. 

Self teaching is best if you're 
motivated or curious about program- 
ming. "Learning on your own is a lot 
belter than learning in class," says 
Morgan Davis, author of MouseTalk. 
"You end up doing a lot more discov- 
ery, and you learn a lot more than by 
taking notes or reading a book. You 
experience all aspects. It's more of a 
personal discovery." 

Tony Garcia works with dozens 
of programmers. "Almost every pro- 
grammer at Epyx is self-taught. They 
may have gone to college, but that's 
not where they learned it." When 
asked whether or not formal instruc- 
tion was even necessary to get a 
programming job, Garcia said, "You 
don't need to start out in a class at all. 
Wc [at Epyx] don't care if they've 
gone to school or not. If they code 
well, they get the job." 

So how do you learn on your 
own? When you take home your 
programming language, sit down and 
read the tutorial. If you like doing the 
exercises and find you take to it right 
away, then you're perfect for self 
teaching. If you're frustrated, take a 
course. 

Besides the tutorials that come 
with the programming language, you 
should also scour your local bookstore 
for computer programming books. 
There are two types: references, which 




contain a list of your programming 
language's commands (the good ones 
will have thorough examples), and tu- 
torials, which show you the ins and 
outs, the ropes of programming in 
your chosen language. Bruce Webster 
notes, "It helps to have a good book. 
There are skills and techniques you 
can learn from books, but the creativ- 
ity is something you have to do on 
your own." 

Taking formal instruction helps 
avoid some of the problems you may 
encounter when you go the do-it- 
yourself route. Also, when you teach 
yourself, you have no one to call if 
you have a problem or question. "It 
really helps to have someone help you 
get through the basic concepts; other- 
wise there's always a high frustration 
level," says Webster. 

Programming classes also help 
you avoid wasting time reinventing 
the wheel. There are lots of program- 
ming tricks out there — more than all 
the books could possibly list. You'll 
learn these tricks when you take 
programming classes. You won't learn 
them sitting at home, where you could 
agonize over a problem some pro- 
grammer solved in the 1950s, 

688 Attack Sub programmer John 
Ratcliff points out that while school 
doesn't teach what's necessary to write 
a computer game, it docs offer the 
background you need to write a pro- 
gram, "Taking a course is extremely 
valuable," he adds. "Everybody needs 
to be exposed." 

Not everyone agrees, however. 
"You can't learn what you need to 
learn in schools," says Tony Garcia, of 
Epyx. "They teach flow charting, 
which is good, but net practical. The 
good programmers arc the ones who 
taught themselves. Because they've 
taught themselves, they're naturally 
creative people. When you're learning 
on your own, it sparks ideas that 
learning in school wouldn't. [Learning 
by yourself is] a more frustrating 



environment, but it gives you more 
creativity." 

If you decide to take a formal 
programming class, there are several 
sources to explore. One of the most 
obvious is the store where you bought 
your computer or software. Classes are 
also taught by local adult-education 
schools or by community colleges. 
These institutions are usually less 
expensive than universities; night 
classes are the norm and are often 
only a month long. This fits perfectly 
with most people's work schedules. 

And, of course, there are always 
the local colleges and universities. The 
courses may be more expensive than 
those at community colleges, but 
chances are they're more thorough and 
you'll have a wider selection to choose 
from. 

Choosing a place to learn 
programming may end up being a 
moot point in the near future. "1 think 
the logic and analysis skills necessary 
for programming should be taught at 
the grade-school level," says Bruce 
Webster. "I don't want to see them 
teach programming for programming's 
sake. I want to see them leach them 
logic and analysis — how to solve a 
problem, which is the essence of 
programming." 

But, before getting excited, keep 
in mind that programming isn't for 
everyone. "If you find programming 
frustrating, then it's probably not for 
you," says John Ratcliff However, he 
adds, "You don't need to be a pro- 
grammer to get the most out of a com- 
puter. You can do artwork, animation, 
music for the software — and more — 
and you don't need to program." 

No matter where you go or how 
you do it, learning to program gives 
you something else to do with your 
computer — and you learn more about 
your computer in the process. 

And if you get good (cross your 
fingers), you'll soon discover that 
training your computer can be far 
more rewarding than leaching your old 
dog a few new tricks. Q

28 COMPUTEI 









The MacTable puts an Apple on your desk in just the right place 
and leaves room for peripherals as well. 



Your wrists feel like you've been arm 
wrestling Andre the Giant. Your 
neck's as stifT as a Buckingham Pal- 
ace guard. Your eyes are burnt to 
cinders and the electric charges leaping from 
your monitor could power a small city for a 
month. You thought computing at home 
would be fun. Nobody ever told you it 
would make you nightblind and nervous. 

If that litany of ills has a familiar ring, 
don't despair. Whether you're running a 
business out of your home, moonlighting 
away from the office, or using your machine 
for education and games, there are steps you 
can take to keep your home computer fires 
burning — without burning out. 




Start at the Top 

When it comes to a desktop, you can keep it simple or 
shoot the works. Your computer doesn't care whether it sits 
on a desk made of imported rain forest bubinga wood, a 
$20 card table, or a sheet of plywood nailed to sawhorses — 
provided, of course, that the desk is stable and there's room 
for the equipment. But the right desk setup can mean a lot 
to you. 

A lot of department stores sell ready-to-assemble 
(RTA) computer desks for anywhere from S80 to S200. 
Assembling the desks requires patience, the ability to read 
pictographic assembly instructions, and a few simple tools, 
like a hammer and a screwdriver. The RTA furniture look 
ranges from white laminate (if your tastes run to modern) 
to oak and teak veneers (for the more traditional palate). 
You should be able to find a style and a material to suit the 
look you want as well as perform the function you need. 

O'Sulhvan Industries, for example, offers a line of 
computer stations ranging from simple desks to hutches 
(with shelving space for books and software) to work cen- 
ters (with room for a printer and supplies) in prices ranging 
from $114.94 to SI 89.95. 

Most computer tables you find in stores seem designed 
for IBM PC and compatible computers. They offer space 
for a keyboard and system unit and, on some of the higher- 
priced models, raise the monitor to a shelf at eye level. But 
if you own a Macintosh, with its enclosed monitor, such an 
arrangement might not suit you. Macintosh users are for- 
ever complaining about stiff necks caused by staring down 
at their monitor. 

One answer is the MacTable, available from Scandina- 
vian Computer Furniture (ScanCo) and also from Apple. 
Designed specifically for the Macintosh and .A.pple IIgs, the 
MacTable uses four platinum gray surfaces that tilt so you

A computer desk with overhead storage for books and disks of- 
fers efficient use of space without breaking the bank. 



can adjust the viewing angle for your monitor and the 
working angle for your keyboard and mouse. 

No matter what kind of desk you buy, build, or barter 
for, your keyboard should be about 30 inches off the 
ground — low enough so that you can hold your elbows 
loosely at your sides at about a 90-degree angle. If you keep 
your arms stiff and your wrists bent to make up for a mis- 
placed keyboard, you might fall victim to Carpal Tunnel 
Syndrome (CTS). Your median nerve and the tendons thai 
open and close your hand are housed in the carpal tunnel. 
Prolonged pressure on the tendons (from awkwardly bent 
wrists, for example) can cause numbing sensations and, in 
the worst cases, permanent weakness in your hands. Putting 
your keyboard at the right height, pausing to rest your 
hands, and refraining from really hitting the keys will help 
you avoid the potentially debilitating effects of CTS. 

A Place for Everything 

Now that you have your desk, you have to figure out where 
to put it. If you're lucky, you have a spare room you can 
use for your electronic workshop. Chances are, though, that 
you'll be sharing space with the rest of the family. Comput- 
ers have been crammed into kitchens, loaded into laundrj^ 
rooms, and assimilated into attics across the country. Every 
space has its idiosyncrasies, but there are some common 
precautions you should lake when setting up your system. 

If your computer space is in the dining room or kitchen, 
take pains to guard against spilled food and drink. One pro- 
duct you might consider, especially if young children use 
the computer or if you're a sloppy drinker, is the SafeSkin, 
from Merritt Computer Products. This clear plastic sheath 
fits like a second skin over your keyboard so that you never 
have to remove it — even when you're typing. Your best bet, 
of course, is not to eat or drink while hunched over your 
computer. But this is America, where people munch ham- 
burgers while negotiating a merge into freeway traffic — no- 
body expects you not to eat at your desk. 

If you're working in an attic and you don't have cen- 
tral air conditioning, think about installing a window unit. 

30 COMPUTEi 



.Attics can gel insufferably hot during the dog days of sum- 
mer, and excessive heat will melt your computer's brain as 
sure as a skillet melts grease. 

And Everything in Its Place 

So you're in your room. You think the desk might look 
good against the far wall, with the morning sun coming in 
at your back and warming your shoulders as you whack the 
keys. You'll put some plants on the sill, a couple of posters 
on the wall — maybe an extra reading chair and a bookshelf 
for your software and manuals. 

Sounds great until the sun strikes your monitor and 
the glare hits your eyes like a faceful of lye. Blinded but not 
beaten, you move your desk so that the light from the win- 
dow doesn't strike the screen so directly. That's better. But 
now you notice that the overhead light glancing off the 
monitor causes spots on your retina. You slip on your 
Wayfarers. Now it's so dark you can't see the keyboard. 

Take heart. Exchange that overhead light for a desk 
lamp or floor lamp that casts an indirect light on your 
monitor. A floor lamp is good for most purposes; a desk 
lamp will help with detail work like reading corrections 
from a rough draft or scrawls from a checkbook. 

If the glare from the monitor still burns your eyes — 
and the jury is still out on what harmful effect, if any, can 
result from prolonged exposure to computer monitors — in- 
vest in an antiglare screen. You can pay from $25 to $100 
for a screen, depending on whether you want mesh or glass. 
SherMark Products makes the .Anti-Glare Magnification 
Screen for the Macintosh, which cuts glare and magnifies 
the screen image — a real boon for tired eyes. The Profes- 
sional Glare/Guard, from Lyben Computer Systems, costs 
$100, mounts with Velcro strips, and is said to eliminate al- 
most all very-low-frequency and extremcly-low-frequency 
electromagnetic radiation emanating from a computer mon- 
itor. Tandy sells a nylon mesh screen for its color monitors 
for $24.95. Keep an eye peeled for closeout sales and clear- 
ances at local computer dealers; you may be able to pick up 
an antiglare screen for a fraction of its full price. 



If you decide not to buy a screen, there are some sim- 
ple rules to follow while working at your computer that will 
help alleviate eyestrain. The most important is to give your 
eyes a break. Staring at any object for prolonged periods 
strains the eye muscles because they remain focused at the 
same distance. Get up from your desk every hour or so and 
stare out the window at something in the distance. Make an 
effort to look up every once in a while and look at some- 
thing across the room. 

Also, place your monitor in a place where you don't 
have to strain to see it. If you're looking straight ahead, 
with a slight downward angle (not as much as you get with 
an unsupported Macintosh, but not looking toward the ceil- 
ing, either), you'll alleviate neck and back strain. If you 
don't have a monitor stand, you might want to consider a 
product like the Amiga 500 Command Center, from Ketek 
($99.95 and $! 49.95), which not only raises the monitor to 
a comfortable viewing height, but also supplies space for an 
external disk drive, a hard drive, or floppy disks. A deluxe 
version even includes a surge protector, power strip, and fan. 

Absolutely Shocking 

Even if summer doesn't solder your circuits, winter can 
bring its own brand of misery to silicon city. During the 
cold months, the heated air inside your house is drier than 
most natural deserts. The lack of humidity leads to static 
buildups which, if discharged to your computer, could fry 
chips faster than Lays. Static electricity may be a slight 
annoyance to you when you touch a doorknob or shake a 
hand, but it's your computer's worst nightmare. 

To protect yourself and your machine, discharge any 
static before you sit down by first touching a grounded 
metal object. Curtis Manufacturing Company sells the 
Touch Me First Static Mat, which sits beneath your key- 
board or system unit, for $39.95. The mat dissipates static 
buildup and presents a metal strip that you can press before 
you hit the keys. 

Any computer store will sell static cloths and sprays 
that you can use to wipe off your computer and rid the 
beast of ugly static. Some computer users have been known 
to wrap antistatic clothes-dryer sheets in towels and lay 
them across their machines to soak up any stray static, but 
there's no evidence that this practice works effectively. 

The static in your house isn't the only electrical men- 
ace you have to deal with. The power that comes in from 
the utility company can disturb the inner workings of your 
computer with surges, brownouts, and blackouts. For 
around $15 you can pick up a power strip at a local hard- 
ware store that can serve as your first line of defense. Plug 
your computer, printer, and other peripherals into the 
power strip and then plug the strip into the wall. The strip 
contains a circuit breaker that will take the brunt of the 
punishment should you get a spike from the folks at the 
power plant. 

If you really want to guard against bad juice, you 
might want a line conditioner. Some conditioners include 
telephone jacks so that you can filter your modem and 
phone lines as well as your power lines. A line conditioner 
is your best defense against rogue watts and amps. 

The last word on power is simple common sense: If 
there's a thunderstorm in your immediate area, unplug 
your computer from the wall outlet. A lightning strike can 
travel through your house and into your computer before 
you can say burn! toast. Don't overload outlets with exten- 
sion cords, and make sure all plugs are grounded properly. 



Not only will this help prevent electrical mishaps, but it 
will help prevent fires as well. 

The Big Dust-Off 

If you spill a soda into your keyboard or drop a sandwich 
into your printer, chances are you'll see the damage right 
away. Less obvious, but just as potentially damaging, is 
dust. The malignant motes that make you break out the 
feather duster every few weeks can wreak havoc on sen- 
sitive computer chips. Take the time to cover your equip- 
ment with a dust protector when you're not using it. 
Protectors range from inexpensive plastic covers to 
antistatic vinyl shields. If you want something a little class- 
ier, CompuTogs sells canvas covers in natural (with brown 
trim) or gray (with black trim). 

.A search of computer stores or mail-order catalogs will 
reveal small vacuums with attachments that you can use to 
suck the dust out of your favorite electronic toy. Put one of 
these to work, add a dust cover, and your computer could 
lead a long, clean life. 

Home, Sweet Home 

Constructing a home for your personal computer requires a 
little planning and a healthy dose of common sense. You 
can take advantage of a host of products designed to help 
you master your environment or follow a few simple guide- 
lines to build your own comfort zone. In the end, you'll 
save yourself from a lot of physical aggravation. Your com- 
puter may be the best machine you ever bought, but it will 
never match the machine that runs it. ed

THE MULTILEVEL WORLD OF HYPERMEDIA 



You've got to pay a parking ticket 
at town hall, so prepare your- 
self for a trip througli the 
looking glass: belligerent sec- 
retaries, stairways thai lead nowhere. 
and doors labeled with hieroglyphics. 

But look: In the lobby there's a 
computer running an information sys- 
tem called HyperFind. Several depart- 
ments are listed on the screen. You 
grab the mouse and click on the park- 
ing department. The screen shows a 
brief description, with digitized pic- 
tures of the traffic clerks and buttons 
you can click for more information. 

Click the To Pay Parking Tickets 
button and the next screen tells you 
how to pay by check, how to pay by 
mail, and when late fees are assessed. 
Finally, the screen tells you the cash- 
ier's room number and shows you a 
map of town hall with the best route 
indicated in red. There is also a button 
that, if selected, takes you to a screen 
explaining the appeals process. If you 
want, you can return to the opening

information crystalizes

screen and take an entirely different 
route through city tax information or 
a police officer directory. 

What happened to the bureau- 
cracy? What happened to the angn' 
secretaries and the labyrinthine hall- 
ways? Hypermedia, that's what hap- 
pened. You found your way — down a 
path you selected yourself, not down a 
general-purpose pathway — to the place 
you needed to be. Because of the com- 
puter, you didn't have to wander 
around or follow a guided tour 
through departments you'd never care 
to hear about. 

Hypermedia applications let you 
store and retrieve many kinds of infor- 
mation, including sound and graphics. 
They resemble databases but are much 
more flexible. Information is stored in 
nodes, and you retrieve information 
through links: pathways between asso- 
ciated nodes. Hypermedia-applications 
designers try to offer as many links as 
are practical between nodes of infor- 
mation. When vou clicked on a button

COMPUTE! 



in the parking ticket example, you 
traveled a link to another information 
node. Ideally, you could create links as 
you go; realistically, you would need a 
ver\' powerful computer to keep track 
of your movements. 

For your personal computer, you 
have your choice of several hyper- 
media products ranging from the sim- 
ple to the complex. You've probably 
already seen several kinds of 
hypermedia: outline processors, free- 
form information managers, and 
online tutorials. 

The easiest way to explore the 
possibilities of hypermedia is to find a 
versatile package thai isn't too com- 
plicated. If you have a specific project 
in mind, however, you can save your- 
self time and trouble by choosing a 
simple program tailored to your needs. 
.■\n intricately woven application, for 
instance, calls for a sophisticated 
hypermedia program. Of course, your 
computer will dictate your choice in 
some cases. What follows are descrip- 
tions of several different programs, 
with a view of their structures and the 
tasks they're best suited for. 

HyperCard 

UyperCard is probably the best-known 
hypermedia package on the market. 
Since Apple Computer began bundling 
the program with its Macintosh 
computers in the fall of 1987, Hyper- 
Card has become she hypermedia soft- 
ware for the Macintosh. 

HyperCard is based on a file-card 
metaphor. It stores information in 
fields on cards and then collects the 
cards into stacks. You navigate 
through the data by clicking buttons 
that activate links between one card 
and another. 

A scripting language. HyperTalk. 
expands the range of HyperCard be- 
yond its simple metaphor. For an ex- 
ample of how powerful a HyperCard 
application can be, look at Focal Point 
H. from Mediagenic's TenPotntO di- 
vision. This business-oriented stack 
keeps track of appointments, tele- 
phone contacts, product development, 
and electronic mail. Each card in the 
stack is linked to others, not only 
allowing movement from one card to 
the other, but also updating infor- 
mation changed on one card across all 
related cards. 

Besides its scripting language, 



Imagine someone 
handing you tools 

and wood 

and telling you to 

build anything 

you want. 



//I'ise/'Carrf distinguishes itself with a 
quick-search function. The program 
has gained a reputation for finding 
information quickly. 

■Although it's easy to use, 
HyperCard can be daunting. Imagine 
someone handing you a box of tools 
and a stack of wood and saying, 
"Here — build anything you want." 
Unlimited possibilities may sound ter- 
rific, but creating something from 
scratch is hard work. Many computer 
users have an added handicap: 
They've never seen a HyperCard stack 
before, so they can't even imagine 
what to build. 

-A good way to overcome this hur- 
dle is to experiment with established 
stacks. Get an idea of what a stack can 
do. Look at the underlying structures. 
Make some changes and study the ef- 
fects. Ff you belong to a user group or 
a telcommunications service, you can 



probably find more stacks than you'll 
ever need. 

Tutor-Tech 

Tutor-Tech, hypermedia for Apple 11 
computers, is a carefully defined, but 
limited, program. As its name implies, 
it's best suited for designing educa- 
tional applications. 

Like HyperCard, Tutor-Tech is 
designed around a card-and-button 
metaphor. You create cards and Hnk 
them to other cards, and you create 
buttons to represent the links. Some 
cards can give information about a 
topic, leading students from one issue 
to another through sequential links 
and letting them explore indepen- 
dently through supplementary' links. 
Other cards can pose questions — 
true/false, multiple choice, or fiU-in- 
the-blank — with each possible answer 
accompanied by a button that leads to 
a reinforcement or remedial response. 

Teachers will appreciate Tutor- 
Tech because it's easy to use and be- 
cause it records the progress of each 
student. The program also features 
links to videodisc and speech syn- 
thesizer output, expanding Tutor- 
Tcch's possibilities beyond the 
computer screen. 

Tutor-Tech is a good example of a 
simple hypermedia package, designed 
for one purpose: developing focused 
educational tools for home or school. 
It is not, however, a powerful package. 
You can't create complex lessons, de- 
velop powerful data-storage applica- 
tions, or brainstorm about a problem. 
For those tasks, you need a different 
program. > 



The Next Generation 

On the Apple ItGS. HyperStudio promises to be the next contender in the hypermedia 
race. Lil<e HyperCard, HyperStudio is designed around a simple metaphor: Buttons link 
text, graphics, and sound. You can create text and graphics in the program or import 
these elements from other packages. 

Sound digitizing is one of the program's most impressive features. Besides Sound 
Shop digitizing software, the package includes a digitizing card, a microphone, and an 
external speaker with a built-in amplifier. With these tools you can create full-blown 
audio files. HyperStudio comes with sampte stacks so that you can get an Idea of the 
program's capabilities. 

Another new program, Silicon Beach Software's SuperCard for the Macintosh, adds 
drawing tools and autotrace to HyperCard's graphics features. SuperCard's improve- 
ments are more profound than added graphics tools, however. For building applications, 
the program opens up more programming elements than does HyperCard. While but- 
tons are the main elements that trigger links in Apple's program, SuperCard also lets 
you build custom menus, And because any card element can have a script, any element 
can act as a button. HyperCard also limits your workspace to the standard card size, 
but SuperCard lets you open any of seven standard Macintosh windows. 'Vou can con- 
trol dialog troxes, create new tool palettes, and design stand-alone applications.

Guide 

Guide, the first commercial hyper- 
media program for microcomputers, is 
a good example of a versatile applica- 
tion. More sophisticated than Tutor- 
Tech or HyperCard, Guide is great for 
creating intricate networks of links and 
nodes. Guide is available for the PC 
and the Macintosh. 

To visualize how Guide works, 
imagine that you're reading this article 
on a computer screen. You'd like a 
concise definition of node, so you se- 
lect the word and something like a 
Post-It note pops up with the defi- 
nition you want. .A^fter you've read fur- 
ther, you decide that you want to look 
at the HyperCard section again. Select 
the word HyperCard and you return to 
the passage you want. If you want 
more detailed information about 
Guide's educational uses, you click on 
the word educational — the article is re- 
placed by a list of applications devel- 
oped by college professors using 
Guide. Each link not only leads you to 
different information, but is also a dif- 
ferent kind of link. 

Creating applications with Guide 
is easy. Enter the text of the docu- 
ment, select the items you want linked 
to other information, and choose the 
kind of link you want from a pull- 
down menu, adding information when 
necessao'. This process isn't nearly as 
intuitive as procedures used in less 
complicated packages, but you can 
learn it quickly. 

.Accessories to the program create 
stand-alone hypermedia documents 
that can be read by people who don't 
own Guide. 

Although Guide is almost as easy 
to use as HyperCard, it's more power- 
ful for many tasks — particularly for 
developing annotated documents or 
online instructional materials. It's also 
more expensive, so steer clear of it if 
you just want to dabble in hypermedia. 

MaxThink 

For hypermedia experiments on the 

PC, tr>' .MaxThink. One in a series of 
hypermedia tools, it's a reasonably 
priced, hyper-powered outline proces- 
sor particularly useful for fiddling 
around with new ideas and problems. 

Most outline processors incor- 
porate hypermedia concepts. Sublevels 
of information collapse into main lev- 
els just as some nodes fold into other 




You can toss 
Ideas into the 

computer, 

mix them up, 

and come up 

with new possibilities. 



nodes. But MaxThink doesn't just 
help you build hierarchical outlines; it 
also reorganizes topics in 12 formats, 
giving you new ways to look at your 
ideas. You can shuffle the list, move 
major headings to new groups of sub- 
headings, reorder the list according to 
different priorities, and so on. 

Another useful feature, the REF 
command, generates an alphabetical 
word-frequency list. You can click on 
any word in the list and MaxThink 
will lake you to each occurrence of 
that word in your outline. Use REF to 
cross-reference concepts in your 
outline. 

.Anyone who uses brainstorming 
as a problem-solving technique will 
see the benefits of .MaxThink. Writers, 
managers, and designers can toss ideas 
into the computer, mix them up, and 
come up with a wide variety of 
possibilities. 

Imagine you're trying to decide 
whether or not to plead guilty to that 
fictitious parking ticket. Load Max- 
Think and list the possible advantages 
and disadvantages. Shuffle the list and 
the possibilities take on new implica- 
tions. Order and reorder your topics to 
get a new view of the problem. 

One of Ma.x'Think's most interest- 
ing features is its manual, a Neil 
Larson manifesto on thinking styles 
and the uses of hypermedia. Larson, 
company founder and programmer of 
Ma.xThink, explains how the program 
works, mechanically and philosophi- 
cally, so you understand why as well 
as how to use each command. 



MaxThink isn't instantly intuitive 
like HyperCard or Tutor-Tech, so it's 
hard to learn at first. But if you slick 
with the manual and spend some time 
following Larson's examples, you'll be 
an ace brain stormer in no time. 

If you like MaxThink and enjoy 
Larson's style, check out the other pro- 
grams in the series, such as Houdini 
and HyperLink. 

Gathering tlie Links 

The hypermedia world is still under- 
populated, but it's quickly filling up 
with authoring tools, organizational 
aids, and even computerized fiction. 
Hypermedia lets you customize path- 
ways into large data resources, expand- 
ing your information horizons. In the 
meantime, though, just pay that park- 
ing ticket before the hypertensive cops 
come after you. b

Databases and Your Records 



Database. To many, the term itself is fearsome, calling up im- 
ages of some monster like dBase III with a Byzantine 
programming language and documentation that stretches from 
here to eternity. Hence the database module remains the terra incognita 
of the integrated program, an apparently trackless maze, occasionally 
opened but rarely penetrated. 

It's a bad rap. Databases, software long associated with the mythi- 
cal realm of mainframes and wizards in white coats, got an undeserved 
reputation of being unapproachable. Personal computer programs like 
dBase didn't help any, for its capabilities were hidden in a fabled 
complexity that spread a pall over more accessible databases. 

Yet databases have been largely tamed. In the last few years, they 
have become far more inviting, even winsome, and they stand ready to 
help you in a variety of ways. 

What do databases really do? The quick answer is that they store 
information, but, of course, so do word processors, spreadsheets, and 
most other programs. In fact, databases not only hold information but 
retrieve it selectively and organize it in different ways. Piles of data are 
worthless without some key to rhyme or reason. Imagine a library with- 
out a card catalog or an encyclopedia with the articles printed in random 
sequence. Databases provide indexing, instant recall, and manipulation 
of data. They let you store a great mass of information, pluck out what 
matters, sort it, and print it out.

Such capacities elevate the data- 
base far above, say. the file cabinet, to 
which it is sometimes likened. File 
cabinets mainly hold information ar- 
ranged by rough categories, and data 
searches may require extensive labor 
to locate all relevant material. 
Databases hunt down information in a 
trice. With little effori on your part, 
you can exploit these programs to 
keep track of addresses, club member- 
ships, home possessions, and collec- 
tions grown past human memory. If 
you have a small business, databases 
can be invaluable, not only lo organize 
information about customers, in- 
ventory, and invoices, but also to un- 
cover patterns of sales, prim out 
monthly statements, and generate 
other kinds of documents. 

Of Fields and Farms 

The biggest obstacle to new database 
users is the nomenclature. As always, 
exposure to the vocabulary helps, but 
at the start, at least, the terms seem 
distinctly bland and slippery'. So, if 
you'll gird yourself, we'll plunge in. 

Most databases are not mere Usts 
of items, but rather, lists of bundles of 
items. One item acts as the linchpin, 
and the others describe it. For in- 
stance, a name is the crucial entry in a 
mailing list. An address, phone num- 
ber, and, often, other information re- 
late to il. 

Hence the two main elements of a 
database: records and fields. A record 
is the whole bundle of information 
about the central item. In a mailing 
list, a record might include the follow- 
ing items: Whitney Blake, 10] Para- 
mount Court, Playa del Mar, Califor- 
nia 99999. 

A field is a building block of the 
record. This record has five fields: 
name, street, town, state, and zip code. 
More specifically, a field is the small- 
est part of a record you can search for, 
sort by, and otherwise manipulate. 

Finally, the entire collection of 
records is called a file. 

Agriculture provides a convenient 
metaphor for visualizing these con- 
cepts: The file is like a large, fertile 
plain, and each record is a farm within 
it. Each farm in turn has several fields, 
with a different crop in each. 

How Files Relate 

Database managers come in two fun- 
damental types: flat-file and relational. 

In flat-file databases, you work 
with one collection of records at a 
time. The file is a self-enclosed world. 
While it can be a large world, it re- 
mains sealed off from others. These 
programs are generally simple and 
easy to learn, and they may suit you 
well if you know that all your data will 
fit into one format.

Relational databases can juggle 
information from more than one file 
at a time. Their file borders are 
permeable. It's a significant capacity, 
since two files will often relate to each 
other, yet resist fusion. In business, for 
instance, a customer file will contain 
fields such as Address and Phone 
Number, while an invoice file will 
hold fields such as Date of Sale and 
Account Balance. The first two fields 
deal with individuals, the second two, 
with billing. If you try combining 
them, you lose the central reference 
point and cause confusion, which is 
■ not the point of a database. Yet often 
you may want information about a 
particular customer to be linked to 
information in the invoice file. A rela- 
tional database allows you to associate 
disparate information from several 
files, yielding a major boost in power. 

There's no better way to un- 
shroud the mysteries of a database 
than to build a simple file yourself 
The process is surprisingly easy, 
requiring no knowledge of math and 
few complex conceptual tricks. .As an 
example, we'll construct a basic home- 
inventory database for keeping track 
of possessions. 

Step 1 

Make the Outline 

Begin by thinking about what you're 
trying to do with this database file. 
Each record will center on one pos- 
session, and the database should serve 
many purposes based on the fields you 
create. For insurance claims, the data- 
base should include fields like Date of 
Purchase, Price Paid, Proof of Owner- 
ship, Current Worth, and Date of 
Estimation, which shows when you 
last estimated the item's value. In case 
of theft, a serial-number field will pro- 
vide important information. .A.nd, for 
repairs, fields like Place of Purchase 
and Warranty can be helpful. 

Sometimes a second consideration 
arises: when to subdivide a field. In 
general, fields should comprise the 
smallest particles of data you would 
ever need to recover. Thus, you'll 
make Place of Purchase a single field, 
though you could conceivably break it 
down into fields for city, state, and zip 
code. Because these criteria just aren't 
impoilant for such a database, you 
don't need to break this one field into 
smaller elements. In a mailing list, 
however, such items become much 
more critical, and you should defi- 
nitely make them separate fields. 

Step 2 

Define the Fields 

Run your database program. Once in- 
side it, you begin by defining the 
fields. You define fields by naming 



MAY 1989 



41 



them and by indicating their type. 
You've already named the fields on 
paper in your outline. Jusl type them 
into the program. (Since this article is, 
by nature, quite general in its instruc- 
tion, refer to your own database pro- 
gram for information on how to 
create, name, and type individual 
fields.) 

The most common field types are 
Text. Number, and Date, but you may 
have others, such as picture and 
calculation. Field types tell the data- 
base program how to handle the data 
in future operations. For instance, if 
you were sorting records by date, the 
software would ordinarily place 
04/06/88 before 10/30/84, since 04 
precedes 10. However, if the program 
knows the field is a date, it can check 
the year first and sort properly. The 
field type also tells the program which 
text trappings to assign to entries, so 
prices, for instance, can appear with 
dollar signs and commas. 

A text field normally includes 
alphabetic and numeric characters. A 
number field may allow letters, yet, in 
sorting and calculation, the program 
may heed only the numbers. Thus, the 
Serial Number field in your first data- 
base poses a modest quandary: Should 
it be a text or number field? The serial 
number looks like a number, but it is 
plainly just an identification lag, not a 
quantity. Moreover, serial numbers 
commonly include letters. So. it makes 
more sense to type this field as text. 
The decision may not matter much 
here, but it could prevent grave mix- 
ups in other databases. In Figure 1. 
several fields have already been de- 
fined and text has been selected as the 
type for the Warranty field. 

Step 3 
Enter Data 

Now fill in the records with the real 
meat of the database. Database pro- 
grams vary, but the one used for this 
article lists the fields on the left and 
provides space for data entry on the 
right (see Figure 2). Each screen shows 
one record, and you type in the ma- 
terial field by field. When you've fin- 
ished one record, you move to the 
next, type in more data, and so on un- 
til the end. It's not fascinating labor, 
but once you've finished, you never 
need to do it again. Now you see the 
database take shape. Don't worry if 
your information is too long for the 
boxes on the screen; all of your data is 
being stored and you can adjust the 
layout later. 

Step 4 

Change the Layout 

The layout you're using now is like an 
index card, one record to a screen. If 

42 ■ C O M P U T E 



you printed the database in this lay- 
out, you would get a series of discrete 
clumps of information. This layout is 
fine for many purposes, but it doesn't 
allow an at-a-glance comparison of 
data. To scan the database quickly, 
you need to arrange information in a 
columnar layout. Columns also lend 
themselves to some useful operations 
and prepare the material for a tabular 
report. To change the arrangement of 
your file, call up your layout choices 
and choose Columnar (see Figure 3). 

The database has ten fields — a lot 
of information to squeeze into a single 
page. Rather than try to print the en- 
tire record on one sheet of paper, you 
can instead generate reports to serve 
different purposes. Each report, then, 
omits some of the fields, as appro- 
priate. The key is to focus on possible 
uses for each report. 

For instance, suppose a fire guts 
your house. When you deal with the 
insurance claims agent, it won't much 
matter where you bought your pos- 
sessions or whether they had a war- 
ranty. The crucial items will be proof 
of ownership, price paid, date of pur- 
chase, current worth, and the date of 
estimation. In fact, only proof of 
ownership and current worth are in- 
dispensable (but current worth is often 
speculative, and the item's original 
price, date of purchase, and date of its 
last estimation are all relevant to that 
speculation). 

In this fire scenario, you'll com- 
pile a report from these fields, entering 
each into the layout, in this order: 
Name, Proof of Ownership, Price 
Paid. Date of Purchase. Current 
Worth, and Date of Estimation. The 
software lets you select existing fields 
and shift their order in the columnar 
layout. Just issue a command and the 
schematic layout spreads out before 
you (see Figure 4). 

Step 5 

Format the Report 

The new layout comes into the world 
in a rather raw stale, so you must 
manipulate the formatting. 

First, the entr\' Answering ma- 
chine has too many characters, so it 
doesn't quite fit into the Name col- 
umn. You can eliminate this defect by 
simply stretching the Name column. 
Now Answering machine tucks neatly 
onto one line (see Figure 5). More- 
over, the wider column makes room 
for fuller descriptions of other objects. 
For instance, you can add the word 
crystal before stemware and cedar 
before talking stick. 

The table has a second weakness. 
The Price Paid and Current Worth 
columns refer to amounts of money, 
but they lack dollar signs. Issue the 



dollar-sign formatting command for 
number fields, and the figures now 
stand forth in proper regalia (see Fig- 
ure 5). 

Step 6 

Sort the Database 

We could print right now, but the data 
is arrayed randomly. Order matters 
even in a minuscule file like this one; 
in a voluminous file, order is critical. 

It's easy to list your information 
in useful sequence by sorting. The 
basic rule is Sort the most important 
field first. In this insurance-claim re- 
port, the most important field is Proof 
of Ownership. Without that infor- 
mation, you miglit not be able to col- 
lect any money. In this file, you've 
indicated presence or absence of proof 
with the words Receipt and Lost. To 
place Receipt items before Lost ones, 
conduct a descending sort on the 
Proof of Ownership field. This com- 
mand will begin with the letter nearest 
the end of the alphabet, placing Re- 
ceipt items above Lost ones. 

Although this sort is important, it 
lacks finesse. A second-level sort will 
be even more useful. The next most 
important item is Current Worth. You 
want to arrange your possessions in 
order of potential loss. To place the 
most valuable items at the top, you 
can again employ a descending sort, 
from highest to lowest replacement 
cost (see Figure 7). 

Most databases perform these 
powerful, multilevel sorts easily. You 
can refine an order down to very 
small details. For example, if you were 
listing all the baseball players in the 
National League, you could sort first 
by team, then by position within the 
team, and finally by batting average 
within the position — a triple sort. 
Even your recent double sort clarifies 
the list substantially (see Figure 8). 

Step 7 

Print It 

If you had several pages, you would 
add a header or footer, and perhaps 
you would alter the font or type size 
of the database report. Regardless of 
how the report looks, the database has 
taken the information you supplied 
and has ser\-ed it up on a silver 
platter. 

Reputations linger, and databases 
may remain terra incognita for some 
time yet. Meanwhile, you can have 
them working hard for you. They're 
certainly ready for it. CD

bered lists, and side-by-side or snaking col- 
umns. The program supports more than 350 
printers — dot-matrix, daisywheel, laser, and 
typesetter — and a variety of text formats 
such as ASCII, IBM DCA, WordPerfect, 
WordStar, Microsoft Word, DisplayWrite, and 
MultlMate. Sorting and searching procedures 
can be used with the mail-merge option. The 
autosave function saves all work in the back- 
ground as it is typed to guard against power 
failures or accidents. The macro language 
and compiler allow developers to modify the 
applications for individual uses.

raphy is compiled automatically from the 
notes. The IBM version includes SVi- and

Webster's New World Writer II 

Simon and Schuster 
ISM PC and compatibles 
S1 69.95 

A menu-driven word processor, Webster's 
New World Writer II is directed toward writers 
who need more than the basics of word pro- 
cessing but not all the trimmings found in the 
high-end, professional packages. This pro- 
gram contains functions to control margins, 
spacing, justification, tabulation, headers, 
and footers. It uses a paragraph format rath- 
er than a page format, and three formats can 
be stored at one time. Other features include 
vjor6 counts, page counts, setting marks in 
the text, drawing tx)xes and lines, adding 
nonprinting comments to text, and an oops 
command for restoring deletions. With the 
typewriter mode, the printer can be set to 
print each letter as the user types. The pro- 




gram supports most dot-matrix printers and 
the HP l-aserJet. The main feature of World 
Writer II is the 1 million-word thesaums and 
spelling checker. The thesaurus cross-refers 
the words, and the spelling checker operates 
at tour levels, based on the t/pist's spelling 
abilities. A RAM-resident outiiner, Outiiner +, 
is also included in the package although it 
runs separately from the main program

and note-taker can tie used together to brain- 
storm and create an outline for a document. 
While writing the text with the word proces- 
sor, the reference organizer aids in tasks 
such as recalling reference sources and for- 
matting footnotes. The program is menu driv- 
en and accepts text from other sources.

COM PUTE! .^ 

speafic 




It all started with Aiex, the 
professional minicomputer- 
based word processing and 
typesetting system that's used 
by almost everyone in the pub- 
lishing industry— COA//"L77;7, 
the A'en' York Times, the 
Washington Post. Novs^vek, 
and a list of about 700 others. 

When the IBM PC ap. 
pcarcd in 1981. David Erick- 
son, who helped design .Alex's 
word processing software, 
wrote a fast, streamlined text 
editor for the new micro. He 
modeled the command struc- 
ture on Atex's. 

John Hild. a friend of 
Eriekson's at .-Mex. was so im- 
pressed with the PC word pro- 
cessorthalhedashedofTa 120- 
page manual for it. Hild and 
Erickson started selling copies 
of.A'yH'mc/ for S50 each. 
Before long they were making 
enough money to leave .Atex, 
and XyQuest was born. 

Ay H 'rite s development 
continued to reflect its .Alex or- 
igins. .At the top of a list of pro- 
fessional features is its ncar- 
perfecl file compatibility with 
.Atcx typesetting systems. Be- 
cause most professional writ- 
ers, especially journalists, need 
to communicate with .Alex sys- 
tems, XylVrite has long been a 
popular word processor with 
the pros. 

XyQuest has had some 
trouble broadening Xy If 'rite's 
popularity beyond the circle of 
professional writers, though. 



XyWrite has the well-deserved 
reputation of being the fastest 
text cruncher around, but it 
also has a reputation for being 
difficult to learn. Although 
most seasoned .Vvll 'rite users 
would claim that it's the easi- 
est of programs to use, the 
myth persists. 

There have been some 
noteworthy attempts lo bring 
the .VrH Vj/t' mystique to the 
masses. One of the best is 
David H. Rothman's book 
XylVrite Made Easier: Revised 
and Expanded for Xri^nie HI 
Wh.? (1 988; TAB Books. 13311 
Monterey Lane, Blue Ridge 
Summit, Pennsylvania 17294; 
717-794-2191: 375 pages; 
$2 1.95). The lion's share of 
this volume is dedicated lo de- 
tailed descriptions of the way 
A'rll 'rite expens have cus- 
tomized their favorite word 
processor. Xy Write Made 
Easier is a must for XyWrite 
linkerers. 

■Another useful XyWrite 
extra is Herb Tyson's software 
add-in EasyXy (Mount Vernon 
Economics, 6028 Redwood 
Lane, .Alexandria, Virginia 
22310; 703-960-5357; $75), 
EasyXy consists of a complete- 
ly redesigned menu system 
that makes .\y II 'riie'i power 
more accessible to firsi-time 
users. .Also included in the 
package is Tyson's mouse 
menu system, which is a per- 
fect match for EasyXy's 
menus. 

Not wanting to miss the 
let's-makc-Ay 1 1 r/ff-casicr 
boat, XyQuest recently re- 
leased its own .( La Carte 
menus for .VyHVi/e (XyQuest, 
44 Manning Road. Billerica, 
Massachusetts 1 82 1 ; 6 1 7-67 1 - 
0888; S30 upgrade for regis- 
tered XyWrite III users; S445 
with XyWrite !U Plus). This 
extensive add-in equips Ay- 
Write with a vast menu system 
that frees the novice from re- 
membering commands. 

XyWrite pros may find 
the A La Carle menus a hin- 
drance, preferring XyWriie'% 
own speedy commands and 
help system. In fact. XyQuest 



itself sees its new menu system 
simply as a means to get more 
people to try A'yUrrfc. 

If you've put off trying 
Xyyvrite because of its diffi- 
culi-to-learn reputation, .1 La 
Carte. EasyXy. or XyWrite 
Made Easier can make getting 
to know the program nearly 
painless, .And after you've got- 
ten your feet wet, you may find 
yourself in the company of 
thousands of XyWriters who 
arc, to quote Richard Bach, au- 
thor of Jonathan Livingston 
Seagull and veteran XyWriter, 
"charmed by the lightning sys- 
tem's glitler and fire." 



High Noon 



There may be a showdown 
brewing. There's a new word 
processor in town, poised to go 
head lo head with Xyiy'riie. 
Computerease made its 
reputation designing PC prod- 
ucts ihat make .Alex-lo-PC 
communications easier. Its 
newest offering. Word Mover 
(Computerease, 654 Metacom 
.Avenue, P.O. Box 1 70, Warren, 
Rhode Island 02885; 401-245- 
1 523; Jl 50). combines the best 
word processing features of the 
company's previous tools with 
some new functions. 

WordXforer is XyWrite- 
filc-compatible, which means 
that its files can be read by 
.Alex systems as easily as Xy- 
tf 'rite's. .And, to make com- 
munication even easier, the 
program has a built-in tele- 
communications module. 
Document tracking, another 
high-end feature, rounds out 
I he package. 

Word Mover has much of 
.VyK'mc's configurability and 
power. You can redefine the 
keyboard, screen colors, print- 
er-definition files, and most 
other aspects of the program. 

The program's features in- 
clude an online spelling check- 
er, built-in mouse support, a 
menu structure that you can 
customize with the program's 



56 COMPUTE! 






in-board function program- 
ming language (FPL), and sev- 
eral user-seleciable help levels. 

Part of Word Mover's 
power as a (elecommunicaior 
comes from its ability to trans- 
lale files on the fly. You can, 
for example, translate a file 
from Sprint format to Word 
Mover format as you down- 
load il. 

These features are impres- 
sive, but there are some cave- 
ats, too. 

Word Mover is flexible, 
but you'll have to get your 
hands dirty to lake advantage 
of its power. For example, al- 
though the program can be 
configured for almost any 
printer, you may have to do 
the fine-tuning yourself 

Word Mover's spelling 
checker presents no alterna- 
tives for misspelled words; it 
simply stops at each word that 
isn't in its dictionary' and asks 
you whether it's OK. Busy 
writers will want a spelling 
checker that provides best 
guesses for misspellings, .^nd 
many writers will want a the- 
saurus, too. 

It's true that you could 
buy an add-in dictionary and 
thesaurus, but you might be 
spending something near 
XyWriie's street price of S250 
by that lime, and Xy Write has 
a turbo-charged spelling check- 
er and thesaurus built in. 

Although Word Mover 
has some features that Xy- 
Write users might envy (such 
as integrated telecommunica- 
tions and mouse support), this 
new entr>' isn't likely to win 
any converts away from Xy- 
Write. It is, however, an attrac- 
tive choice for writers who 
need Xy Write file compatibil- 
ity and require a measure of 
XyWrite's power but can't af- 
ford XyWrite's price. 



Don't Panic 



"1 know I've got a virus," my 
friend shouted. "CHKDSK 
shows that nearly a third of my 
disks contain a hidden file of 
zero bytes. 

"What else can it be?" he 
continued. "I know about 
DOS's hidden system files, 
I BMD0S.COm' and IBMBIO- 
.COM, but those files aren't on 



these disks. And no utility that 

shows hidden files displays 
these mysterious files, I'm 
doomed." 

To find the source of this 
phantom file, I began running 
CHKDSK on my disks. I soon 
found the offending message — 
bytes in 1 hidden files. 

I consulted two DOS ex- 
perts, but they were as sur- 
prised as 1 was at the presence 
of this mysterious file. Two 
days later I stumbled on the 
origin of this baffling nonexis- 
tent file and learned something 
very interesting about one of 
DOS's quirks. 

DOS stores files in direc- 
tories. In each directory, each 
file has an entry that contains 
the filename, its extension, an 
attribute byte, time and dale 
information, the starting clus- 
ter number of the file, and the 
file's size. 

The names of a directory's 
subdirectories are stored in en- 
tries just like filenames. How 
does DOS tell the two apart? 
The attribute byte is the key. 
This byte encodes information 
about the type of directory en- 
try: normal, read-only, hidden, 
system, volume label, sub- 
directory, or archive. 

If an entrv' is a subdirec- 
tory, the subdirectory bit in the 
attribute byte is set. If the file 
is hidden, the hidden bit is set, 
and so on. 

Now. perhaps the most 
interesting bit in the attribute 
byte is the one for volume la- 
bel. Each disk can have one 
volume label only, so the bit is 
used only once per disk. DOS 
doesn't want the volume label 
to appear as a filename in di- 
rectory listings, so it sets the 
hidden bit, loo. 

When you run CHKDSK, 
that program counts files and 
subdirectories. Ifthesubdirec- 
lorj' bit is set. the entry is a 
subdirectorj': otherwise, it's 
counted as a file. Since the vol- 
ume label isn't a subdirectory, 
CHKDSK erroneously thinks 
it's a file. And because the vol- 
ume label is merely a name 
and not a true file, it doesn't 
have a length — it's zero bytes 
long. Voilal 

If you see that mysterious 
message, don't panic — your 
system doesn't have a virus; 
CHKDSK just has a case of 
(he sniflTles.

Il will come as no surprise to 
anyone who has followed the 
Commodore 64/128 over the 
past couple of years that the 
market has become oriented 
almost totally toward enter- 
tainment software. Part of this, 
of course, has to do with the 
machine's age: By now, there's 
enough variety in productivity 
software lo suit anyone who 
chooses to leap aboard. Com- 
panies have little reason to re- 
lease yet another package in 
these areas. 

There are other reasons, 
though. For the past couple of 
years, as Commodore has been 
concentrating on the Amiga 
and MS-DOS markets, the 
company has tried, publicly, lo 
dump the Commodore 64/128. 
The company might have 
looked, instead, at .Apple Com- 
puter's example: Apple not 
only continued to support the 
.■\pple II line, but also added 
machines because of the line's 
popularity. Not until very re- 
cently has .Apple seemed lo 
want the Apple 11 to disappear. 

The major reason for the 
entertainment orientation, 
however, can be construed 
positively rather than nega- 
tively. When the Commodore 
64 first appeared, its 64K of 
memory, special music chip, 
and superb graphics capabili- 
ties were derided by those who 
felt serious computers were 
text-only machines, but the 
rest of the market look the 
Commodore features lo heart. 
Before long, the Commodore 
64 became the machine of 
choice for first release of new 
entertainment software. The 
reason was simple: graphics, 
animation, color, and sound 
were all available, so the Com- 



modore 64 became, in effect, 
the first serious alternative to 
the arcades. 

Yes, it proved to be a rea- 
sonably good applications ma- 
chine as well. I wrote two 
books on my Commodore 64, 
using one 1 541 drive and a 12- 
inch, black-and-white televi- 
sion. I know of two people 
who ran small companies with 
the machine. Educational pro- 
grams abounded, as the price 
made it atiraclive lo schools. 
But the Commodore 64 re- 
mained, first and foremost, a 
games machine because it 
more than fulfilled its original 
promise of strong graphics and 
good sound. .And as the pre- 
dominance of games software 
for the machine now demon- 
strates, it's still an excellent 
machine for this purpose. 



GeoWrile Fight 



Tired oi geoWrite?'^aw 
you've got a choice in GEOS- 
compaiible word processors. 
Timeworks (444 Lake Cook 
Road, Deerfield, Illinois 
60015; 312-948-9200) has 
tt\e!:i%iA GEOS Writer 64 
(S39.95), a new word processor 
for the Commodore 64. Time- 
works is well known in the 
Commodore market, for such 
successful applications as 
Word Writer 3, Smfiax, and 
Sylvia Porter's Financial 
Planner. 

GEOS Writer 6'^. as lis 
name suggests, runs under 
GEOS. As such, it's the only 
real competition {ot geoWrite 
Workshop. Why anyone would 
bother competing with the 
built-in GEOS word processor 
is difficult to determine unlit 
you realize that GEOS Writer 
64 is different. The Timeworks 
package is a considerable im- 
provement over the original 
gt'olFr/fcand should provide a 
good alternative for users of 
geoWrite Workshop and 
GEOS 2.0. It supports mouse, 
joystick, or keyboard input 
and offers considerable control 
over formats, headers, footers, 
culling, and pasting. 

The major difference be- 
tween this program and the 
standard GEOS word proces- 
sor is that its onscreen text 
isn't graphics-oriented. Its dis- 

M A y 19 8 9 S7 



speqic 



play isn't as snazzy a.sgeo- 
Writes and geoWrite Work- 
shop'i, and it isn't WYSIWYG 
(although you can preview a 
page in Writer 64 with its 
Show Full Page feature). On 
the plus side, though, the pro- 
gram is noticeably faster. 

For GEOS users who 
found typing in geoWrite slow 
and laborious. Writer 64'% 
speed will be a delight. To be 
sure, the program harks back 
to the olden days, when post- 
typing formatting was the norm 
(PaperClip is the most obvious 
example here), but since the 
Commodore 64 is a funda- 
mentally slow machine, this 
svstem does speed things up. 

GEOS Writer 64 of^trs 
full compatibility with geo- 
Write, geoPaint, and other 
GEOS packages. You can im- 
port fonts from FontPack Plus, 
add graphics from GeoPaint, 
and so on. You can also check 
the document using geoSpell, 
but since GEOS Writer 64 in- 
cludes a faster, 100,000-word 
spelling checker, this step is 
unnecessary. 



And Other Fights 



Technocop, looks at the future 
of crime fighting. As a member 
of the elite Enforcers squad, 
you tr>' to rid the world of a 
mob known as DOA (Death 
On .Arrival). 

.Armed with an .88 Mag- 
num pistol, a topnotch crimi- 
nal radar detector, and an 
optioned-to-thc-hilt VMAX 
Twin-Turbo Interceptor, you 
clean out 1 1 scuzzy-looking 
tenement buildings. You shoot 
your way through layers of 
flunkies to capture the heavies. 

The game is divided into 
two distinct portions. In the 
first, you race along the high- 
way, avoiding other vehicles or 
blowing them off the road with 
your machine gun, hydraulic 
wheel ram, rapid-fire cannon, 
or tactical nukes (your weap- 
onry improves further into the 
game). At seemingly regular 
intervals, your car automati- 
cally pulls oiTthe road, and the 
second part of the game be- 
gins. Here, you battle bad guys 
inside one of the buildings. To 
raise your rank from Grunt to 
Technocop, you have a lot of 
death to deal out. Technocop 



sells for $39.95 and is pub- 
lished by Epyx, 600 Galveston 
Drive, Redwood City, Califor- 
nia 94063; (415) 368-3200. 

While we're on the subject 
of arcade-style games, let's 
look at three relatively new 
packages. 

Victory Road, from Data 
East (470 Needles Drive, San 
Jose, California 95 11 2; 408- 
286-7074). is the sequel to 
Ikari Warriors. You battle 
Slonehead and his unsightly 
army as you fight your way 
through a series of increasingly 
depressing screens. Each is 
filled with nasty and unsavory 
things wishing to dine upon 
your flesh, and each level even 
has a superdcmon just in case 
you get cocky. Game control is 
straightforward, and the action 
is fast and deadly. Victory- 
Road (S29.95) is a good trans- 
lation from the arcades. 

Avantagc has chipped 
into the arcade scene with Jet 
Boys. You enforce the law on 
Saturn by fighting the Mega- 
beasts, a group of pug-uglies 
who have captured a nuclear 
reactor on one of Saturn's 
moons. You must deactivate 
the reactor before the Mega- 
beasts destroy it and the whole 
planetary system. Standing in 
your way is an entire multi- 
tude of antisocial types. You 
fly over lava columns and the 
like with a jet-pack, and you 
improve your weapon by col- 
lecting pods. On each level, 
there's a Megabeast that you 
must destroy. Graphics are 
strong and gameplay is fast 
(too fast for my aging fingers, 
but fine for those in good 
health). Jet Boys costs S 14.95, 
and you can contact .Avantage 
at 550 South Winchester Bou- 
levard, San Jose, California 
95128; (408) 296-8400. 

Also from the arcades is 
Arcadia's Double Dragon 
(S34.99). Here, as arcade fans 
already know, brothers Billy 
and Jimmy Lee rescue Billy's 
girlfriend Marian. Marian has 
been kidnapped by the Black 
Warriors, minions of the Shad- 
ow Boss. Billy and Jimmy get 
to use their martial arts exper- 
tise along with any weapons 
they might find — baseball 
bats, oil drums, and so on — to 
free Marian from their ene- 
mies' evil clutches. Double 
Dragon is fine as an arcade 
game, but one of its more in- 
teresting aspects comes from 



its programming. In order to 
include all the options from 
the arcade, the programmers 
decided to use two sprites rath- 
er than one for each animated 
character, a technique that re- 
sults in a small line across the 
middle of each character. The 
line doesn't impede play, 
though. .Arcadia products are 
distributed by Electronic Arts, 
1 820 Gateway Drive. San Ma- 
teo. California 94404; (41 5) 
571-7171. 

Finally for this month, 
Accolade has released Grand 
Prix Circuit, a Formula One 
racing simulation. Fans of Ac- 
colade's Test Drive will feel 
right at home with this game, 
since control of the car is large- 
ly the same. In fact, Grand 
Prix Circuit might well be con- 
sidered Test Drive minus the 
boredom of the mountain 
road. In Grand Prix Circuit, 
you race against other drivers 
(not the cops, as in Test Drive) 
on eight different tracks. Three 
cars are available — Ferrari, 
Williams, and McLaren — for 
races in Brazil, Monaco, Cana- 
da, Detroit, Britain, Germany, 
Italy, and Japan. Pit stops are 
crucial, as is timing your driv- 
ing perfectly. Grand Prix Cir- 
cuit is certainly among the best 
race games available. For more 
information, contact .Accolade, 
550 South Winchester Boule- 
vard, Suite 200, San Jose, Cali- 
fornia 95128; (408) 296-8400.

People sometimes forget that 
.Apple II computers are almost 
as important to high schoolers 
as they are to elementary- 



school kids. Apple lis are sol- 
idly entrenched in grades 9 
through 1 2, for much the same 
reason that K-8 computers 
usually sport the Apple II 
logo — quality educational 
software. 

Because of its power, the 
top-of-the-line .Apple lies is an 
ideal machine for the high 
school classroom. .And al- 
though higher-level education- 
al software has been long in 
coming. llGS-specific packages 
are beginning to show up. One 
such program, and a topnotch 
one at that, is Sensei Soft- 
ware's Geometry. 

First developed for the 
Macintosh, Geometry for the 
IIgs retains much of the origi- 
nal's flavor, for it. too, offers 
an easy-to-use interface, pull- 
down menus, mouse support, 
and bitmapped graphics. The 
three-disk package is not copy- 
protected, so the program can 
be installed on a hard disk or 
ramdisk with little trouble. A 
ramdisk is particularly useful, 
since the program frequently 
goes to disk during a session — 
the electronic disk cuts down 
on wasted time. .A minimum 
of 5 1 2K. of R.4M is suggested 
by Sensei, putting the program 
within reach of almost every 
IIgs owner, but 768K is a 
more realistic requirement. 

Geometry follows the 
standard high school course 
curriculum and, in fact, is best 
used as a complement to exist- 
ing textbooks or classwork 
rather than as a stand-alone 
package. Organized in text- 
book fashion, with a table of 
contents, over 350 problems 
and their solutions, and even a 
bookmark-like way to save 
your place. Geometry uses the 
computer's unique abilities as 
much as possible, Turn pages 
by clicking on the bottom dog- 
ear, or shift to another chapter 
by pulling down a menu. Click 
on the highlighted terms 
(marked in color, naturally), 
and you see an example. Enter 
an incorrect value in a prob- 
lem, and the program tells you 
it's wrong. Solve the problem, 
and the computer congratu- 
lates you just as quickly — no 
more waiting for the teacher 
to scrawl answers on the 
blackboard. 

The program uses graph- 
ics extensively to illustrate 
concepts; animation helps 
demonstrate some of the prob-

though, Geornein' is not a

Time to Fight 



Battles of Napoleon — a recent- 
ly released computer war game 
from SSI, the preeminent pub- 
lisher of computer war games — 
is as much a construction kit 
as it is a simulation. Not only 
can you refight four key battles 
in Napoleon's career — Boro- 
dino (1 8 1 2), .\uersiadt ( 1 806), 
Quatre Bras (181 5), and Wa- 
terloo (181 5) — but if you have 
the inclination, you can recon- 
struct virtually any conflict 
from the era or even manufac- 
ture fictitious struggles to ex- 
plore what-if scenarios. 

The complexity oi Battles 
of Napoleon is evident as soon 
as you begin to pore through 
the two manuals. If you're a 
newcomer to war games, the 
jargon will distress you; if 
you're comfortable with such 
terms as melee, operation 
points, and zones of control. 
however, you'll feel right at 
home. 

Like many SSI games, 
Battles of Napoleon puts you in 
charge of an almost bewilder- 
ing array of units, each requir- 
ing your orders and atleniion. 
Unlike some computer war 
games, which try to duplicate 
reality by letting you give only 
general orders (and which then 
force you to walch as your sub- 
ordinates royally screw things 
up). Battles of Napoleon allows 
you to tactically direct individ- 
ual units. One suggested addi- 
tion to the package would be a 

60 COMPUTEI 



paper map. so that the entire 

battlefield's terrain could be 
taken in at a glance rather than 
seen in screen-sized chunks. 

You can lake command 
of either side — French or .\\- 
lied — and duke it out with the 
computer. One nice touch lets 
you choose the computer's 
strategy, in effect handicapping 
it if you feel a bit nervous 
about losing. 

The construction-kit as- 
pects of Battles of Napoleon 
are impressive. You can create 
scenarios, armies, and maps 
and then deploy the forces and 
set victorj- conditions. It's 
even possible to change the 
game at its basest level by al- 
tering the actual logic of battle. 
Want to double the dcadliness 
of rifle fire? Simple. Want to 
turn one unit into hand-to- 
hand-combat fanatics? Easy. 

Battles of Napoleon gives 
you a chance to forget the 
modern world as you try to 
imitate one of the worid's most 
famous military commanders 
(or grind his armies into the 
dust). Military history buffs 
and war-game aficionados will 
find much here to educate and 
entertain them. Others not so 
inclined will find themselves 
in over their heads trv'ing to fill 
Napoleon's shoes. 

Battles of Napoleon runs 
on any Apple II, is available 
only on 5'/4-inch disks, and 
costs $49.95. Contact SSI at 
1046 North Rengstorff Ave- 
nue, Mountain View, Califor-

Tax Time 



It's only weeks away. April 15, 
the deadline for filing federal 
income lax returns, strikes fear 
into even the stoutest hearts. 
Searching through receipts, 
collecting forms, and calculat- 
ing taxes is a job best left for 
the orpnized. Or for those 
with a personal computer and 
tax-preparation software. 

Apple 11 owners have a 
wide choice of programs, rang- 
ing from the venerable Tax 
Preparer, from Howardsoft, to 
Softview's graphics-oriented 
TaxViea; .All tax packages, 
though, have certain strengths 
and weaknesses. Some are too 
complicated; others work only 
on the IIgs. One tax-prep 



package that's simple to use, 
and which works on every Ap- 
ple II, is Timeworks' Swiftax. 
(Simple, of course, is a relative 
term when the IRS is involved.) 

Requiring only 128Kand 
filling three 5'A-inch disks (if 
you want a 3'/j-inch version, 
you have to mail in a card), 
'Swiftax guides you through the 
maze of tax frustration. 

Forms are the backbone 
of any tax return and, thus, 
any tax-prep package. Swiftax 
offers the most common, in- 
cluding Forms 1040, 1040A. 
and 1040EZ, and Schedules A 
(itemized deductions), B (in- 
terest and dividend income). C 
(profit or loss from business or 
profession), and SE (computa- 
tion for Social Security self- 
employment tax). Most people 
will be satisfied with the forms 
Swiftax offers, although the 
omission of Form 8283, re- 
quired if you make charitable 
contributions of more than 
S500, is unfortunate. 

Filling out the forms is a 
matter of answering Swiftax's 
questions and entering num- 
bers in the proper spaces. One 
of the program's most impres- 
sive features links forms, 
schedules, and attachments to 
Form 1040. .As you use linked 
forms, their totals are auto- 
matically placed on the correct 
line on the 1040. This feature 
really cuts down on the dupli- 
cate calculations and paper- 
work you endure if you do 
your taxes by hand. 

Good print quality is as 
crucial to computerized tax 
programs as good handwriting 
is to the paper-bound preparer. 
Swiftax is adequate, though 
not as dazzling as some of its 
competition — especially Tax- 
Vieiv for the lies, which prints 
the actual forms, not just the 
values. 

You can print on regular 
paper, then transfer the figures 
to the actual forms by hand, 
but that's a waste of good com- 
puting power. You can also 
print to the actual forms, 
which means you must first 
colled them (the best are those 
in single-sheet form, usually 
found at your local post office; 
those forms bound into the 
packet you receive in the mail 
from the IRS sometimes tear 
when you remove them, or 
bind in the printer). Once you 
have multiple copies of every- 
thing you need, you must align 



the form and the print ribbon. 
Even then, be ready for several 
tries before the page comes out 
perfect. 

Still, Swiftax is highly rec- 
ommended. The menu system 
is comfortable, and although 
the disk access is substantial 
(and slow when you're using 
5'/i-inch drives), the wait is 
worth it. 

Swiftax is published by 
Timeworks, 444 Lake Cook 
Road, Deerfield, Illinois 
60015; (312) 948-9200; $69.95.

Sculpt-Animate 4-D ($499.95)

ies as icxlurc/bump mapping 
and Rcnderman support. 
Since there's nothing hke SA4- 
D on the Macintosh right now, 
Byte by Byte should have the 
market to itself. 

But that's not the most in- 
teresting news. Byte by Bjle 
also plans to bring out SA4-D 
for Silicon Graphics' Iris series 
of computers. You know the 
ones — the 3-D workstations 
thai cost from $ 1 6,000 lo 
$140,000 and are popular with 
the professional computer 
graphics effects crowd. The Iris 
version o^SA4-D will use the 
same kernel that the Amiga 
and the Macintosh versions 
use and vvil! also be file-com- 
patible with those versions. 

Peterson envisions a cost- 
effective animation environ- 
ment in which many artists 
use SA4-D to create objects 
and scenes on plain Amiga 
500s and then move files to an 
Iris for high-powered render- 
ing. It will be interesting to see 
whether the big animation stu- 
dios start buying .Amiga 500s 
in 100-unil lots. The Disney 
studio that tossed its first 
Amiga in the trash because it 
didn't live up to expectations 
is reportedly interested in such 
a system. 

With all this high-end ac- 
tivity. Byte by Byte promises 
not to abandon the .^miga. 
"We like the machine," said 
Peterson, "and we'll support it 
as long as Commodore steys 
afloat." Keep rowing. West 
Chester.

Guernevitle, California 95446; 
707-887-9708; Si 4.95), a three-

which is especially strong on 
games. That list doesn't men- 
tion the occasional .Amiga disk

Fiching for ARexx 



Give credit lo Software Vi- 
sions (P.O. Box 33 1 1 9, Fra- 
mingham, Massachusetts 
01701; 800-527-7014) for one 
of the few new ideas in data- 
base management. 

Software Visions devel- 
oped Microfiche Filer (S99), a 
database program like no oth- 
er. Microfiche Filer data is or- 
ganized like information on 
the microfiche cards you find 
in libraries — a condensed 
sheet of text and pictures over 
which you drag a magnifying 
glass to locate information. 
The interface is so intuitive 
that even people allergic to da- 
tabases like lo use it. Micro- 
fiche Filer is especially useful 
as a picture catalog because it 
can manage and display any 
kind of .Amiga IFF files. 

Where Microfiche Filer 
doesn't quite measure up is in 
raw power. Software Visions 
has corrected this problem 
with the release of Microfiche 
Filer Plus ($ 1 79). .Among the 
new features are instant, as- 
you-type field calculations; 
more sophisticated picture 
handling, with auto-reduction 
and color remapping in all 
Amiga screen formats; better 
printing; and a comprehensive 
ARe.x.x interface. 

ARexx is a programming 
language developed by Wil- 
liam S. Hawes (P.O. Box 308, 
Maynard, Massachusetts 
01754; 508-568-8695; avail- 
able separately for S49.95). 
ARexx is simple and compact, 
easy to learn, and easy to 
run — in short, an ideal lan- 
guage for new or occasional 
programmers. While you can 
learn the basics of program- 
ming with ARexx and use it to 
create siand-alone applica- 



tions, it's intended primarily 
as a macro or scripting lan- 
guage. That's how you can use 
its power with Microfiche Filer 
Plus. 

You car\v/me ARexx 
macros which perform a scries 
oi Microfiche Filer Plus opera- 
tions. For example, your mac- 
ro, which you type directly 
into Microfiche Filer, could 
import a mailing list into the 
applications from another 
Amiga program, sort the list by 
a specified field in each record, 
then prompt you to set up 
your printer for mailing labels. 
This is the sort of program- 
ming power that has always 
been offered by mainstream 
database managers like dBase 
III but has been lacking on the 
.Amiga. 

That's not all ARexx can 
do. You can use the language 
to extend the capabilities of 
any compatible program or de- 
vice. At the December World 
of Commodore show in To- 
ronto. Software Visions dem- 
onstrated a video catalog using 
Microfiche Filer Plus and 
ARexx to control a videodisc 
player through an Interactive 
Microsystems MediaPhile in- 
frared controller. 

People scanned through 
the Microfiche Filer Plus data- 
base to select information for 
display from the videodisc. 
Then, with a single keystroke, 
the segment from the video- 
disc popped up on the .Amiga 
monitor (routed through the 
.Amiga via a genlock). The pro- 
grammer, Ron Currier, claimed 
he spent less than an hour 
writing the ARexx macros to 
control Microfiche and the 
MediaPhile. 

If more .Amiga applica- 
tions and hardware support 
.■l/tc.v,v. it will become far easi- 
er for ordinary .Amiga users to 
build custom systems. The ide- 
al, of course, is for all com- 
puter devices and programs to 
talk to each other — and to you. 
the user — with complete fluen- 
cy. It might (and should) hap- 
pen first on the Amiga. 



Hyper-Amiga 



Here's an open question to the 
.Amiga developer community: 
Why hasn't a program like 



HyperCard been developed for 

the Amiga? 

HyperCard, for those un- 
familiar with it, is an easily 
programmable database loose- 
ly based on an index-card met- 
aphor. Included are basic word 
processing, paint program, re- 
port-generating, and hypertext 
capabilities, along with Hyper- 
Talk, the best object-oriented- 
like programming language yet 
devised. 

People who have never 
tried programming and proba- 
bly wouldn't even make an at- 
tempt with a relatively simple 
language like ARexx (which is 
in fact quite similar to Hyper- 
Talk) can master HyperTalk 
quickly and create their own 
applications or databases 
(called stacks in HyperCard 
lingo) with a few hours of 
study. Educators like Hyper- 
Card because it makes small, 
custom applications easy lo 
develop. Developers use 
HyperCard to act as software 
front ends for hardware such 
as scanners, to provide addi- 
tional program capabilities 
such as report generation, or to 
create online help. 

As one of the most flexi- 
ble and easy-to-use packages 
ever written, HyperCard has 
made a big splash in the Mac- 
intosh software worid. Over 
the last 18 months, it has been 
an important factor in the re- 
cent surge of Macintosh sales. 
(It doesn't hurt that .Apple 
ships a free cop\- of HyperCard 
with each new Macintosh 
computer sold.) 

But the program has nota- 
ble shortcomings; it lacks 
color, true multitasking, multi- 
ple screens, resizable cards, 
real animation, high-quality 
music, and video compatibil- 
ity — all problems that arc hard 
for the Macintosh to overcome 
but easy for the .Amiga. A can- 
ny Amiga developer could take 
the HyperCard conctpl and 
improve it in ways the Apple 
won't be able to achieve for a 
year or more. In fact, if any de- 
veloper is doing that. I'd like 
to hear about it.

mation of interest to the

Watching Apple move into the 
business world is like watching 
your best friend join an exclu- 
sive sorority. Slowly but sure- 
ly, she spends less time with 
you and more time with her 
new buddies. You don't spend 
enough money for her, you 
don't drive the right kind of 
car, and you don't shop at the 
really chic stores. 

Apple's been spending 
more time in the business sec- 
tor, developing network tools, 
moving into a high-end plat- 
form, and paying homage to 
UNIX and Ethernet. What's in 
it for us? Does Apple have a 
free day to do lunch with the 
home users? 

Probably not. Even Janu- 
ary's price cuts weren't very 
friendly. After introducing the 
68030 Macintosh SE at the 
same price as the 68000 SE's, 
Apple had to make some 
changes. The company low- 
ered the price of its most pow- 
erful SE from $5,069 to $4,369: 
prices on three Mac II configu- 
rations fell by anywhere from 
9 to 16 percent (the biggest de- 
crease was applied to the most 
expensive system). Prices on 
some memory-expansion kits 
and some hard disk drives 
were also lowered. But did Ap- 
ple drop prices at our end of 
the spectrum? Hardly. The 
Mac Plus is still $1,799, and 
the one-megabyte SE with a 
20-megabyte hard disk drive 
holds steady at S 3,898. 

Apple said lower compo- 
nent costs account for the price 
reductions on the most power- 
fully configured systems. That 
doesn't explain why the low- 
end machines weren't afTectcd. 

Even though prices are 
high, Apple's first-quarter sales 



rose by less this year than last 
year — 35 percent in 1989 ver- 
sus 57 percent in 1988. On 
Januarj' 27, after the decreased 
profits were announced, Ap- 
ple's stock prices plummeted 
to 37y8, dropping by just under 
10 percent while the rest of the 
market rose by 1 Vi percent. 
Gloat if you wish. 



Even More Super 



Silicon Beach has shipped ver- 
sion 2.0 oiSuperPaim, the first 
graphics package to combine 
painting and drawing tools. In 
the computer-graphics world, 
paint features are based on bit- 
mapped graphics, and draw 
features are based on object- 
oriented graphics. Each has its 
strengths — you get cleaner laser 
printing with object-oriented 
graphics but more control over 
detail with bitmapped graphics. 

The new SuperPaint of- 
fers more power and more user 
control. On the Paint side, Sili- 
con Beach has added an ad- 
justable airbrush with control 
for dot size, pattern, and paint 
flow; AutoTrace, which con- 
verts bitmapped pictures into 
object-oriented pictures; and 
custom tools, which you can 
create and add to the Toolbox. 

A Bczier tool has been 
added to the Draw layer of 
SiiperPainl. This tool draws 
curves based on points that 
you define. Another set of im- 
provements adds hairlines, ar- 
rowheads, and dashed lines to 
your choice of line styles. Ver- 
sion 2.0 also allows multiple 
fonts and type styles in a single 
text block. 

There are new features 
that improve the package as a 
whole. You can define the size 
and orientation of your docu- 
ments, allowing muitipage files 
and horizontally oriented 
pages. You can edit graphics in 
reduced view. SupcrBits, 
which has replaced LaserBits, 
edits bitmapped graphics in 
the Draw layer. TIFP-file- 
format support and color page 
preview are also available in 
the new package. 

SuperPaint 2.0 retails for 
$ 1 99. It's available to regis- 
tered users for $50. If your 
SuperPaint program was bun- 
dled with one of Microsoft's 



packages, you also quahfy for 
the $50 upgrade. 

The really hot package 
from Silicon Beach is Super- 
Card, one of the highlights of 
the Macworld Expo. Just as 
SuperPaint is an enhancement 
of the Claris standbys Mac- 
Draw and MacPaint. Super- 
Card leaps from the platform 
that HyperCard built. You can 
convert all of your HyperCard 
stacks to SuperCard easily, so 
your old files will be compati- 
ble with the new program for- 
mat. You may wonder why 
you didn't start the stacks from 
scratch, though, once you see 
how SuperCard works. You 
can read more about it in 
"Nodes and Buttons and 
Links! Oh My!," (page 34).

Claris Expo 



Look — there's a spelling 
checker in your graphics pro- 
gram and everything but the 
typist in your word processing 
package. 

At January's Macworld 
Expo, Claris announced an up- 
grade to one of its best sellers 
and promoted several new 
packages. 

MacDraw //'s new fea- 
tures include a spelling dic- 
tionary, so now you can check 
words in your graphics files 
just like you check them in 
your word processor docu- 
ments. Another new feature 
lets you annotate MacDraw I! 
files with computer sticky 
notes; they work much like the 
yellow ones you find attached 
to paper documents. There are 
lots of other improvements — a 
slide manager for presentation 
files, a millimeter scale on the 
ruler, more command-key 
equivalents, and more — so the 
upgrade is substantial. 

MacDraw // I . I is due out 
in February and retails for 
$399. Registered owners of 
MacDraw 11 can upgrade for 
$30, and registered owners of 
the original iMacDraw c&n up- 
grade for $200. If you bought 
MacDraw // after January 1, 
1 989, you're eligible for a free 



upgrade. 

Enough about upgrades. 
What's new from Claris? 

New is MacWriie II. The 
program retains the simplicity 
of the original MaclVrilcb\n 
sports more than 50 new fea- 
tures, according to Claris. 
You'll get more done with 
MacWrite II. since it runs 
three to five times faster than 
the original and checks spelling 
as much as ten times faster. A 
more WYSIWYG approach 
will also make document cre- 
ation easier and more produc- 
tive: Headers and footers show 
on the page, multiple columns 
are supported, and you have 
more control over leading, 
type styles, and type sizes. If 
you're working at home, Mac- 
Write I! now makes more 
sense, because its new mail- 
merge feature will let you fiood 
clients with form letters and 
correspondence. Even heavy- 
duty writers will find A/flc- 
H'we// appealing; nearly 
every Mac writer wants to 
search for fonts, styles, and 
sizes. For fast access to for- 
mats, you can slick as many as 
30 in a menu and use them as 
styles. 

Don't think of this new 
package as a mere upgrade of 
the original MacWrite. From 
Claris' description, it's a com- 
pletely new animal, in compe- 
tition with WriteNow l.G 2M& 
Microsoft Write. 

MacWrite II. due out by 
the time you read this, retails 
for S249. If you own MacWriie 
5.0, you can upgrade forS65; 
other versions of MacWrite 
can be upgraded for $75. 

Outside the home computer 
user market, Qaris introduaxi 
three other products at the 
Macworld Expo: Claris OiD— 
a $799, two-dimensional 
computer-aided-design pro- 
gram for engineers, drafters, 
and designers — and two entries 
in the new SmarlForm scries, 
SmartForin Designer {$i99) 
and SmartForm Assistant 
($49). Directed at the business 
market, SmartForm Designer 
lets you create applications, 
requisitions, and forms. Smart- 
Form Assistant lets you fill in 
those forms on the computer.

Epyx hasjust launched its 
Balileship. a translalion of the 
popular paper game, for the 
ST. You can play against the 
computer or another person. 
After you've placed your ships 
on a 24 X 24 grid, they never 
appear onscreen again — the 
computer keeps track of where 
they are. 

In Salvo mode, you can 
take as many as 24 shots per 
turn (depending on how many 
ships arc still afloat). Hits are 
indicated at the end of the 
turn. If you turn off Salvo 
mode, you can lake as many as 
4 shots. 

Besides a bigger board 
and more ships than you find 
in the traditional game, Epyx's 
Battleship includes graphics 
enhancements that make the 
game more interesting but 
which don't afTcct play much. 
As ships sustain damage, for 
instance, the destruction 
shows onscreen, getting pro- 
gressively worse until the ships 
sink, leaving nothing but a life 
prescn'cr. Games can be 
played very quickly, and the 
computer opponent is devil- 
ishly good. 

The game costs S29.95, 
and you can contact Epyx at 
600 Galveston Drive, Red- 
wood City, California 94063; 
(415)368-3200. 

Br0derbund(17Paul 
Drive, San Rafael, California 
94903-210!: 415-492-3200) 
has translated its 8-bit karate 
hit/t:flra/<'te($29.95)toan 
Atari ST version. You control 
the hero as he fights opponents 
and rescues the princess from 
the evil Akumo's castle. Joy- 
slick control is poor, with 
punches and kicks scattered in- 
discriminately, but the key- 
board control works surpris- 
ingly well. Except for some 

64 COMPUTE! 



enhanced graphics and sound, 
however, this game differs Ut- 
ile from the earlier version. If 
you've mastered the original, 
this version will present Utile 
challenge. 



Game Maker 



STOS, The Game Creator is 
BASIC especially designed for 
writing games. The language it- 
self is somewhat old-fashioned 
It requires line numbers (no la- 
bels); it limits IF statements to 
a single program line (usually, 
program lines equal several 
screen lines); and it doesn't 
allow such elements of struc- 
tured programming as DO, 
procedures, or multiline fiinc- 
lions. Computed GOTOs are 
allowed, as are REPEAT UN- 
TlLs and WHILE/WENDs. 

Where this language really 
shines, though, is in the sup- 
port it provides for writing en- 
tertainment software. .As many 
as 1 5 software sprites, a music 
track, and menu polling are all 
supported via interrupts, so in- 
cluding these features in your 
program doesn't appreciably 
slow it down. STOS is not a 
GEM program, but il supports 
menus, windows, file selectors, 
and a mouse. 

Interestingly enough, be- 
cause STOS does not work 
under GEM, many of GEM's 
limitations are bypassed. Win- 
dows arc automatically re- 
drawn with a variety of 
custom borders. Menus can 
also be customized, as can the 
file selector. Except the menu 
selections, messages are not 
supported, so there's no simple 
way to tell whether the user 
has clicked on a window. 
Scroll bars, move bars, and so 
on don't exist on windows. 

STOS comes with acces- 
sories to design sprite images, 
music, icons, and fonts. Differ- 
ent fonts can be installed in 
each window. The sprite com- 
mands include MOVE, ANI- 
MATE, and coUision detec- 
tion. Once started, these 
commands run in the back- 
ground and don't interfere 
with your program. You can 
even set up a path for the 
sprite to follow and have il 
change animation sequences 
automatically. Loading multi- 
ple screens (in DEGAS or 



NEOchrome format) is just a 
command away, as are vertical 
and horizontal screen scrolling 
and swapping, enlarging, and 
shrinking sections of the 
screen. The manual is poorly 
organized, but it has an excel- 
lent quick-reference card. The 
product is distributed on three 
single-sided disks and includes 
three complete games and a 
runtime package. Contact An- 
tic Software, 544 Second 
Street. San Francisco, Califor- 
nia 94104; (41 5) 957-0886. 



Invading Aliens 



Belter Dead than Alien, from 
Electra (distributed by Discov- 
ery Software, 1 63 Conduit 
Street, Annapolis. Mar>'land 
21401-2512; 800-342-6442; 
$34.95), is a superb game in 
the Space Invader/Galaxians 
family. 

You control a small base 
that moves horizontally and 
vertically. Waves of aliens 
march across the screen and 
drop bombs on you. Periodi- 
cally, several aliens will break 
off and dive at you. You score 
more points for destroying the 
aliens if they're diving. Being 
hit by a bomb or an alien uses 
up energy, and when the ener- 
gy is gone, the game is over. 
You can partially recharge by 
cutting down on your firing 
rate for a while, but this tactic 
is dangerous. 

Each of the well-animated 
waves of aliens is different 
from the others, and the waves 
are interspersed with segments 
where you must destroy mete- 
ors. Other segments pit you 
against huge, menacing aliens, 
which can withstand many 
hits before they die. Every so 
often, a tone sounds and one 
of the aliens begins to glow 
green. Destroying that alien re- 
leases a special weapon pill, 
which you can catch if you're 
fast. These special weapons in- 
clude such things as shields, 
double ships, rapid fire, and 
high-powered lasers. Most of 
the time, you lose these special 
weafions when you move to 
the next section. 

On completion of each 
section, you get a code word; 
entering that code word imme- 
diately takes you to a more dif- 
ficult level. The game also 



includes a two-person, simul- 
taneous mode. It's quite a bit 
easier to play with two people 
cooperating because you have 
twice as much firepower. 

The final high point of 
this game is its sound. If you 
do well, you'll be treated to 
scattered applause; do par- 
ticularly poorly and you'll be 
heckled. This game is highly 
recommended and tremen- 
dously addictive. 



Gee. Plus 



A very useful program from 
Codchcad is G + Plus (said Gee 
riiis. not Gee Plus Plus), which 
retails forS34.95. This pro- 
gram replaces GDOS, the por- 
tion of the STs operating 
system that must be loaded 
when you need very-high- 
quality printed output. A vari- 
ety of programs use GDOS, 
including Publisher ST (Time- 
works), WordUp (i^eoccpi), 
and Easy- Draw {Migraph). 
Unfortunately, GDOS slows 
graphics operations on the ST 
quite a bit. It's also rather in- 
flexible: The file that describes 
the fonts and printer drivers 
(ASSIGN. SYS) must be load- 
ed when you boot your ma- 
chine, it must reside in the 
root directory, and it can't be 
changed without rebooting. 
This file (and the fonts associ- 
ated with it) arc different for 
each G1X)S application, which 
means that you must typically 
reboot each time you want to 
use a different program, 

fj + Plus loads when you 
boot, and not only does it allow 
you to change ASSIGN.SYS 
files whenever you wish, but it 
also has an editor so you can 
associate the correct ASSIGN. 
SYS file (which no longer 
needs to be called .ASSIGN. 
SYS) with the proper applica- 
tion. When the application is 
loaded, C+Wn5 will auto- 
matically load and activate 
the right font-description file. 
It can even find the font- 
definition file in a folder so 
that you don't clutter up your 
root directory. G + Plus docs 
not slow down your ST, and it 
even has a mode which speeds 
up redrawing of the Desktop. 
Once you've tried G+Phts. 
you'll never use GDOS again.

L.A. Crackdown 

You're head of a two-man surveillance 
team charged with infiltrating the illegal 
operations of the Pacific Shipping 
Company, gathering enough evidence 
to make an arrest stick, and apprehend- 
ing the company's owner and his 
henchmen. To aid you in the enterprise, 
the Drug Enforcement Agency has pro- 
vided you with a sophisticated surveil- 
lance van, and the L..A.P.D. is loaning 
out one of its newest rookies. 

That's the premise ofL-A. Crack- 
down, the newest entry in Epyx's Mas- 
ter Collection line of simulations. The 
game's clever concept, ease of use, well- 
designed game screen, colorful and 
nicely animated graphics, and sound ef- 
fects make it an attractive package for 
computer owners interested in police 
surveillance. 

Still, there are some flaws. Mean- 
ingful discoveries seem to be the result 
of trial and error, not the producls of 
logical deduction or even user intuition. 
.Also, the canned conversations between 
rookies and other characters are repeti- 
tious. Loading time for these dialogues 
on the Commodore 64 using a 1 54 1 
disk drive is often excessive, but it's re- 
lieved somewhat by Epyx's Vorpal fast 
loader. 



Despite these shortcomings, L.A. 
Crackdown is a pretty good simulation 
of police methods. .And it's a lot less ex- 
pensive than buying your own surveil- 
lance van and equipment — safer, too.

LEGO TC Logo 
Starter Pack 

Children have been playing with LEGO 
bricks for years. Parents have been step- 
ping on LEGO bricks for just as long. 
Now. with the LEGO TC Logo Starter 
Pack, parents get their chance to build a 
LEGO model — one that can be pro- 
grammed to move. 

Combining LEGO bricks with a 
computer is a graceful, simple concept: 
Build a model, give it commands, and 
then step back to see if it does what 
you've told it to do. The learning skills 
required are developed through fun and 
curiosity. 

It's easy to set up LEGO TC Logo. 
Install the interface card, use the ribbon 
provided to connect the control box to 
the interface card, and then plug the 
box into an outlet. Long connector 
wires give your contructions room to 
move. 

Anyone above age 9 can use LEGO 
TC Logo. The logical lessons teach se- 
quential order in programming. This is 
a singularly and spectacularly successful 
product. .A.n IBM version is scheduled 
for release this spring.

SimCity 

SimCily lets you walk a mile in the 
mayor's shoes. The game simulates the 
growth and decay of a city. 

Start from scratch with raw land or 
choose a scenario such as San Francisco 
after an earthquake, Tokyo after a mon- 
ster attack, or Hamburg, Germany, dur- 
ing World War II firebomb raids. 

In developing your city, you bull- 
doze the landscape and then set up resi- 
dential, commercial, and industrial 
zones. Link those zones to a power 
plant; then build roads and mass-transit 
systems. Sounds complicated, but it's as 
easy as grabbing an icon and clicking on 
the map. Sound effects accompany your 
growing city as traffic patterns develop 
and trains run along your newly laid 
tracks. 

You don't win this game as you 
win action games. Every development 
eats up city funds, prompting you to 
raise revenues. Watch your budget and 
keep tabs on your Evaluation, which 
tells you whether the citizens think 
you're doing a good job. 

SimCity reflects the fundamentals 
of city planning, with every decision 
and factor influencing others. Commer- 
cial zones, for instance, depend on the 
size of residential zones. If you want to 
learn even more, the manual includes a 
historical perspective on city develop- 
ment and a bibliographv.

simulator. Abrams puts you in com- 
mand of a single MlAl Abrams, the 
Army's front-line tank, and drops you 
into combat situations where every hill 
and vale hides legions of enemy ar- 
mored vehicles and infantry, and the 
skies are filled with unfriendly 
helicopters. 

Inside your tank, you move among 
three stations — commander, gunner, 
and driver — to direct, fire, and move 
your vehicle. There's a lot to do (you're 
acting all the parts) and even more to 
watch for. Spotting enemy targets at 
long range is imperative, for the first 



shot often decides the battle. At night 
you have an advantage, since the 
Abrams is equipped with a thermal 
range sight that "sees" in the dark. 

You control the tank from the key- 
board (a joystick can be used to maneu- 
ver and fire the beast). Neither the 
screen readouts nor the controls are 
complicated, although keypresses must 
be quick. 

Abrams is a mix of simulation and 
game. It provides a feel for life and 
death inside a modern tank yet doesn't 
overwhelm you with all the dirty little 
details of tank warfare. Don't expect 
complete realism — single tanks don't 
take on waves of enemy armor — but do 
expect a rousing good time.

Samna has beaten everyone, including 
Microsoft, to the punch by releasing 
Ami, the first full-strength MS-DOS 
word processor to run under the Win- 
dows graphics environment. In a world 
where graphics translate to ease-of-use, 
this word processor has you producing 
professional-looking documents right 
away. But that performance comes at a 
price. 

By using Windows as its shell. Ami 
avoids the command line interface 
common to most MS-DOS word pro- 
cessing packages. Rather than learning 
various key combinations to set mar- 
gins, define text blocks, print, and per- 
form other tasks, the Ami user can 
control these features by pointing and 
clicking with a mouse (highly recom- 
mended, although it's possible to move 
around in Windows from a keyboard). 
All things considered, such a graphics 
interface makes Ami easy to learn and 
to use. 

There is, however, a big disadvan- 
tage to such an interface: the high cost 
of the hardware needed to present a 
friendly face to the user. By selecting 
Windows as its environment. Samna 
leaves a significant number of potential 
users out in the cold. Consider v4mrs 



basic hardware requirements: a 286- 
based (AT-class) machine or better; 
EGA, VGA, or a Hercules-monochrome 
graphics card; one high-density drive 
for either a 1 .2-megabyte S'A-inch or a 
1 .44-megabyte S'A-inch floppy disk; 
640K of RAM, with extended or ex- 
panded memory for improved speed; 
and at least a 10-megabyte hard drive 
(which, by the way, isn't mentioned on 
the box).

Ami is different from other IBM PC word 
processors — it does Windows. 



If you're already working under 
Windows, you can dive right into Ami's 
main features, which are impressive. 
Take, for example, the 26 style sheets, 
or templates, that come with the sys- 
tem. You'll find a preset style sheet to 
fit almost any writing project. If you use 
this feature, you'll no longer have to 
worry about document layout. Tabs, 
margins, fonts, paragraph alignment, 
and columns arc all defined by the style 
sheet you choose. 

Every Ami document must be ref- 
erenced to one of these style sheets. If 
you don't see a template you like, you 
can modify a style sheet or create your 
own. But if you're a new user and you 
want to get up and running in a hurry, 
it's hard to beat the predefined tem- 
plates. The memo style sheet, for ex- 
ample, lets you include all of the 
traditional memo headings (To, From, 
Date, and Subject) when the screen 
comes up. All you have to do is fill in 
the blanks. Other predefined style 
sheets include letters, reports, propos- 
als, overheads, newsletters, press re- 
leases, and books. Several options are 
generally available in each category. 

Windows users will recognize 
Ami's Frames feature, which lets you 
define a frame, or box, anywhere on the 
page and fill it with graphics or text. 
Frames can be made transparent or 
opaque, and text will automatically 
flow around them just as in expensive 
desktop publishing programs. 

With Ami. you can enter text in 
either of two modes. In Layout mode.

you type the text directly into the style 
sheet. What you see is what you get 
here — down to fonts and frames. Un- 
fortunately, the system gets a bit slug- 
gish in Layout mode when text is 
entered quickly. Those with faster fin- 
gers might prefer the Draft mode. 

If you hit the wrong key and man- 
age 10 change the layout or erase some- 
thing by mistake, Ami's Undo Function 
will cancel your last operation and re- 
store the screen. This handy tool is 
especially useful when you're first learn- 
ing the program because it encourages 
you 10 experiment and take chances, 
knowing all the while that your mis- 
takes can be easily corrected. And if you 
get totally lost, context-sensitive help is 
available. 

Once you have created a docu- 
ment, Windows makes handling files a 
breeze. Getting and Saving are handled 
quickly from the File Menu. The Docu- 
ment Management System lets you re- 
name, copy. move, or delete a file with 
a click of the mouse, 

.•!/H("s 130,000-word spell-checker 
works quite well. When I checked the 
spelling in this review, the program al- 
ways offered the correct word in its list 
of alternatives — no matter how badly I 
had misspelled. 

As impressive ^ls Ami's features 
are, however, the program's power is 
limited by what is left out. For example, 
there's no thesaurus. Nor is there any 
mention of macros for frequently used 
words or phrases. .Also among the miss- 
ing are automatic envelope printing, a 
way to perform mathematical calcula- 
tions, an address database, mail-merge 
functions, and adequate file linking for 
joining several files or chapters together 
and printing them with consistent head- 
ers and footers. For a package that con- 
stantly talks about increasing your 
productivity. Ami lacks some of the 
more basic productivity capabilities 
found in other word processors like 
WordPerfect (versions 4.2 and 5.0) and 
XyWriteJII+. 

Some of these capabilities will be 
included in a more powerful version of 
the package, called Ami Professional, 
which has yet to be released. Buyers of 
Ami receive a $ 100 coupon they can use 
toward their purchase of Ami Profes- 
sional — and they can keep their original 
Ami software. 

While I'm among the first to agree 
that we desperately need a standard, 
workable interface in the MS-DOS 
world, I'm not ready to accept less pow- 
erful software to get it. The Windows 
interface is attractive and easy to use, 
but if important program features have 
to be omitted so that the software will 



run efficiently in that environment. 
then I'll stay with a more powerful, 
more traditional word processor. 

If you're already working in the 
Windows environment, Ami is certain- 
ly a step up from Windows Write. Also, 
if you need to produce professional- 
looking documents in a hurry and you 
don't need features like mail merge and 
file linking, then Ami 's shon learning 
curve and style sheets are hard to beat. 
But if you're looking for a powerful, 
full-featured word processor in the me- 
dium-price range, you'll be better off 
with a text-based system. Ami may 
have been the first full-blown Win- 
dows-based word processor out of the 
block, but I'm going to whistle it for a 
false start.

Caveman Ugh- 
lympics 



wham! Wham! Wham! In face, Thag! 

Just one of the more intimate mo- 
ments in Caveman Ugh-lympics. a hi- 
larious game that parodies computer 
sports entertainment as it puts your joy- 
stick skills to the test. 

If you've had your fill of computer- 
ized Olympic events, tr\' the six Ugh- 
lympian contests on for size. How 
about the Mate Toss? Or the Dino 
Vault? Each prehistoric event is good 
for some grins; most arc surefire ways 
to stress out your joystick and your 
pulse rate. 

The scene is simple, just like the 
athletes. Long before the Greeks got to- 
gether to flaunt their laurel leaves, cave 
dwellers gathered to beat up each other, 
run from animals, and hurl themselves 
over carnivores. Six Ugh-lympians 
have come from all corners of the an- 
cient globe to play (or fight): Vincent, 
Gronk, Glunk, Thag, Ugha, and the 




Best your opponent with the dread over- 
head smash in Caveman Ugh-lympics. 

only cavewoman, Crudla. Except for 

Vincent, who's good at nothing, and 
Gronk, who's good at everything, each 
of the contestants is strong in two 
events. Choose Vincent or Gronk to 
handicap or give an advantage to one of 
the six possible players. 

The first bout, Mate Toss, lets you 
spin your mate like a hammer and then 
throw him or her through the air. Joy- 
stick dexterity comes in handy here (as 
in all the events), as you must quickly 
twist the stick to make your ugly athlete 
twirl. After your mate has soared to an 
undignified landing, he or she gives you 
an instant evaluation: thumbs down, 
thumbs up, or a simple shrug. 

The next contest, Dino Race, sets 
you atop a steed who's nearly as stupid 
as you. Spur your dino to make it run 
and whack its back to leap boulders, all 
the while judiciously applying the club 
to its head to make it pick up the pace. 
Miss the jumps and you spill off the 
dino: bash it too many times and it gets 
confused. 

Fire Making requires even more 
joystick agility as you rub sticks togeth- 
er, blow sparks into fire, and bop your 
opponents on the head. Funny stuff 

Clubbing is the boxing of bygone 
days. No subtlety here — ^just an out- 
and-out bash. Club high, club low, club 
in face. Point up in the air ("Look. Hal- 
ley's Comet!") and your too-dumb-to- 
live opponent pauses and stares, 
leaving you an opening for the dreaded 
overhead smash. 

The Saber Race takes its theme 
from the old TV show "Run for Your 
Life." Fall behind and you're lunch for 
the biggest kitty this side of the La Brea 
tar pits. Reach the finish line and you 
can climb a tree and shout insults at the 
cat below (wait — ^no, you can't . . . lan- 
guage hasn't been invented yet). 

The last trial is the Dino Vault, 
where you try to spring over a slobber- 
ing meat eater. Set the height of the 
dino. run, plant your pole, and let go to 
sail over its head to the rock mat below. 
Screw up and you'll end up in the ra-

vine or in the carnivore's mouth. 

Caveman Ugh-iympics ' cartoon- 
style graphics enhance the feeling of fri- 
volity but are nevertheless quite 
impressive. Characters are substantial, 
unlike the tiny figures featured in some 
sports software, and they flail their 
arms and roll their heads with enthusi- 
asm. Distinguishing your athlete from 
your opponent is troublesome only in 
the Saber Race, where a mixup can 
spell disaster. 

As in most Commodore 64 games, 
the sound and music are more than ad- 
equate. The sound effects— the bops, 
bumps, and blows— are good, and the 
mood music sets the scene without get- 
ting in the way. 

Gameplay is pretty traditional: lots 
of joystick moves, a few button presses. 
The balance between making the joy- 
stick moves too tough and requiring at 
least some physical coordination is 
good. A sense of rhythm is probably the 
best trait you can have if you hope to 
get into the Caves of Fame. 

Caveman Ugh-lympics is, without 
a doubt, a scream. Solo play is boring, 
but bring in another player and the 
room will echo with shouts and laugh- 
ter. It's strictly Three Stooges-style 
humor, the prehistoric equivalent of 
fingers in the eyes and pies in the face. 
Violem? Sure. Realistic violence? No 
way. 

The stars circling heads and crosses 
over eyes are right out of Saturday- 
morning cartoons. Clubbing your oppo- 
nent has about as much connection 
with reality as Wile E. Coyote taking 
that long fail into the canyon. Twelve- 
year-olds will love this game for the 
simple action and frenzied joystick han- 
dling. Forty-four-year-olds will love it 
for the same reasons, although some 
may claim that they laugh because 
Caveman Ugh-lympics pokes fun at 
sports-event software. 

Don't believe them.

The New 
Talking 
Stickybear 
Alphabet 



Stickybear is the computer world's 
goodwill ambassador to the country of 
children. A perennial favorite, this cud- 
dlesome character has been smoothing 
a lot of rough road, helping all he can 
with math, language, spelling, and 
reading. 

And, thanks to the Apple IlGS, 
Stickybear has now become a good 
friend to teachers, too. The New Talk- 
ing Stickybear Alphabet, the newest ad- 
dition to the Weekly Reader software 
line from Optimum Resource, brings 
exciting graphics and unique, realistic 
sounds to a classic package and. in the 
process, piques the interest of young 
children as few other programs do. 

The Apple IIgs is just the right tool 
to transform an educational program 
like The New Talking Sticky^bear Alpha- 
bet into an exceptional learning expe- 
rience. An acrobat tumbles across the 
screen and does double flips. A gopher 
scoots underground across the screen 
and pops up every few inches. A tiger 
lets out a fierce roar, and a cow moos so 
realistically it will make you reach for a 
glass of milk. 

The program comes on two 3'/2- 
inch disks and includes a brief but in- 
formative manual. Also included are a 
poster of the Stickybear family and 
stickers, which will delight young com- 
puter users. Instructions are also in- 
cluded for the installation of the 
program onto a hard disk. 

There are three basic games to play 
with The New Talking Stickybear Al- 
phabet. All are easy to learn and use. 
The first game is Alphabet. A child 
presses any letter on the keyboard and 
Stickybear appears, says the letter, and 
recites a word beginning with that let- 
ter. An animated picture, such as a fly- 
ing airplane, then illustrates the word. 
The child can sec two examples for 
each letter in the alphabet. 

The next game is Letter Hunt. 
Stickybear is in control here. He says a 
letter and then gives the child unlimited 
time to find that letter on the keyboard. 
When the child presses the correct key, 
an animated graphic describes a word 
that begins with that letter. If the child 
presses an incorrect letter, Stickybear 
again shows the letter requested, in up- 
per- and lowercase form, and repeats its 
name. If the child still can't find the 
correct letter, the program moves on, 
but it later returns to the problem letter. 
Of course, children can press the space 



bar on their own to move on to another 
letter. 

Fast Letters is the third game. 
Stickybear says the name of any letter 
that the child presses. Unlike Letter 
Hunt, however, the child is in complete 
control of the program and can move at 
his or her own pace. 

Adults may find Fast Letters and 
Alphabet a bit frustrating because chil- 
dren tend to want to see the same thing 
over and over. When children have 
control over the program, as in these 
two selections, adults should sit quietly 
and keep their hands offthe keyboard. 
Let the child set the speed of play. 




The New Talking Stickybear Alphabet lets 
kids explore letters and words with ani- 
mated graphics and colorful sound. 

The program's sound quality — es- 
pecially as it recites letters and words — 
is a vast improvement from the robotic- 
sounding voices of the past, Stickybear 
is articulate with each letter, especially 
at the word level. The only letters that 
are difficult to distinguish are the v and 
the b. They sound very much alike, 
with the emphasis on the long e vowel. 
The only place where this problem 
makes the program difficult, however, 
is in the Letter Hunt game. 

The manual is written with parents 
and nonteachers in mind. The writers 
do an excellent job of explaining the 
program's operation as well as its goals 
and objectives. They go on to suggest 
enrichment activities that parents can 
direct to enhance their child's learning 
of the alphabet and to improve their 
child's vocabulary skills. 

Early childhood education has be- 
come a hotly debated topic in recent 
years. No one doubts the importance of 
stimulating young minds to prepare 
them for a high-technology world. The 
argument revolves around the pressures 
put upon children to learn and com- 
pete. The A'eiv Talking Stickybear Al- 
phabet proves that some educators are 
working hard to provide an opportunity 
to enhance learning at an early age 
while at the same lime making the ac-

King's Quest IV: 
The Perils of 
Rosella 



Few text and graphics adventures can 
claim more fans than the King's Quest 
series. The kingdom of Daventry, 
where these stories talce place, is an in- 
viting, comfortable place where kings, 
queens, knights, ladies, dragons, and 
unicorns combine to sweep away the 
problems of modern life. It takes only a 
few minutes at the keyboard for King 
Graham and Queen Valanice to capture 
your heart, 

King's Quest IV: The Perils of Ro- 
sella continues the story. Having re- 
gained the three treasures of Daventry 
(King's Quest), rescued Valanice from 
the treacherous Hagatha (King's Quest 
II), and defended his kingdom from the 
wizard Manannan and his magical 
dragon (King's Quest III), Graham de- 
cides that it's time to pass on his adven- 
turer's cap. 

King's Quest /Kbegins with a ten- 
minute cartoon in which King Graham 
attempts to do exactly that. But just as 
he flings his cap into the air toward his 
heirs, he falls to the ground, seriously 
ill. Is this the end of the valiant king? 
Can nothing be done to help him? 

Tears well up in Rosclla's eyes as 
she contemplates her father's impend- 
ing death. She yearns for guidance. Sud- 
denly, Fairy Genesta appears in the 
Magic Mirror. She tells Rosella of Ta- 
mir, an island fraught with dangers but 
blessed by the presence of a tiny, life- 
giving tree. She will help Rosella find 
the tree, but first the princess must help 
vanquish Lolotte, an evil fairy who has 
stolen Genesta's magic necklace. It 
seems even fairies suffer occasional 

70 COMPUTE! 



misfortune. 

Genesta has become increasingly 
weak since the loss of her necklace and 
its dangling talisman. Unless the magi- 
cal charm can be recovered soon, she 
will lose all her powers and die. 

Faced with an opportunity to help 
her father and save Genesta, Princess 
Rosella places her own life in jeopardy 
and accepts the call of duty. Little does 
she know what dangers lie ahead on the 
island of Tarn ir and elsewhere. Nor can 
we. as game players, claim any special 
insight into Rosella's future. Neverthe- 
less, our course is clear. We must cast 
our fears aside and go forth. What self- 
respecting twentieth century knight or 
lady could refuse such a noble venture? 

Thus begins a pleasurable journey 
through frightening forests, into danger- 
ous oceans, and along peaceful beaches. 
Take your imagination and your humor 
along. You'll need both as you search 
for clues in abandoned castles and ne- 
glected graveyards. Consider, for ex- 
ample, the words on my favorite 
tombstone: 

Dr. I. Letsome 
When people's ill they come to I 
I physics, bleeds, and sweats 'em! 
Sometimes they live. Sometimes 
they die. 
What's that to I? 

I. Letsome 

Don't assume an>1hing during 
your travels. Locales may change from 
visit to visit. What was there once may 
be gone later. Some creatures only 
come out at night. Others appear at un- 
predictable intervals. Rosella's perils 
are complex and involved. If possible, 
lake along as many friends as will ac- 
cept the challenge. 

I played the IBM version, which 
runs effectively with any popular graph- 
ics card/monitor configuration. How- 
ever, the characters and settings really 
come alive only when viewed on an 
EG.4 or. better yet, VGA monitor. In 
addition to outstanding graphics. King's 
Quest IV o^tvs an outstanding sound- 
track for those fortunate enough to own 
the proper equipment. The standard 
mediocre PC sound just won't do. 

For those who demand excellent 
audio in their computer gaming. King's 
Quest IV incorporates drivers for many 
popular sound add-ons, including Ad 
Lib and IBM music cards and the Ro- 
land MT-32 Multi-Timbre Sound Mod- 
ule. 1 was fortunate enough to have 
access to the Roland board and MIDI 
interface. At $550, this 32-voice music 
synthesizer isn't cheap — but it's defi- 
nitely impressive. With it. you'll hear 



songs and sound effects in full stereo. 
The game takes full advantage of music 
add-ons by incorporating 40 minutes of 
original music into the nine S'/t-inch 
floppy disks that comprise the program. 




The adventures in the kingdom of 
Daventry contlnije in King's Quest iV: The 
Perils of Rosella. 

The introductory cartoon to King's 
Quest IV, for example, is enhanced by a 
lyrical tune that accentuates the evolv- 
ing drama. Later, an allegedly bad min- 
strel performs a surprisingly good 
rendition of "Greensleeves" on his lute. 
When misfortune strikes Rosella, an 
entire symphony laments her death. 
Without a special music card, you'll 
miss out on all these subtleties. But with 
the Roland MT-32 installed, you'll en- 
joy 40 minutes of the best sound avail- 
able on any computer disk anywhere. 

With its three megabytes of code, 
its 3-D graphics, and its unmatched 
sound capabilities. King's Quest /I'sets 
a gaming standard others will be hard- 
pressed to match, much less surpass. In- 
cidentally, don't be too proud to 
consider purchasing Sierra's hint book. 
Even the most experienced adventurer, 
like King Graham, can occasionally use 
a bit of help.

Pinstripe 
Presenter 



When it comes lo business, a picture is 
worth a thousand bucks. At least that's 
what business-graphics software pub- 
lishers have discovered. These pricey 
programs, which convert cold spread- 
sheet data to attractive charts, are pe- 
rennial best sellers among business- 
computer power users. Spinnaker 
Software wants to bring graphics power 
to a wider segment of the market with 
Pinstripe Presenter, a low-cost chart 
maker. 

Almost anyone who needs quick, 
good-looking graphics but has little or 
no graphic-design savvy will find Pin- 
stripe Presenter easy to use. It includes a 
number of chart types, including word, 
organization, pie, area, line, and table, 
as well as vertical, stacked, and horizon- 
tal bar with two- and three-dimension 
options. Each chart type is predesigned; 
all you have to do is enter the proper 
data and print the result. The program 
does all the work of chart creation, in- 
cluding laying out lilies, positioning ele- 
ments, and choosing colors. 




Pinstripe Presenter brings business- 
presentation graphics to the home. 

If you need to customize the basic 
chart or if you're just feeling artistic, 
you can use Pinstripe Presenter's, draw- 
ing tools. As with any drawing tool, 
you're better off using a mouse rather 
than the keyboard to make your modi- 
fications. You can also embellish your 
presentation with images from a clip-art 
library. For an especially dramatic ef- 
fect, you can layer several elements — a 
bar chart over a map, for example. You 
can also save the chart design you've 
created as a template for future charts. 

Business-graphics programs live or 
die on their ability to import data from 
Lotus 1-2-3 and compatible spreadsheet 
programs. Pinstripe Presenter has no 
problem in that regard; it accepts both 
1-2-3 and Symphony data. Just set the 
chart type — bar or pie, for example — in 
1-2-3 or Symphony and then save as 
many charts as you need from your 



worksheet. Pinstripe Presenter will rec- 
ognize these chart files and import 
them, with all titles and ranges intact. 
then restyle the charts to suit the pa- 
rameters you've set, within Pinstripe 
Presenter, for that chart type. 

What goes in must come out, and 
Pinstripe Presenter does a good job with 
output. 

The program drives standard Ep- 
son and IBM graphics printers, but also 
outputs files in PostScript format so 
that your charts can be printed with the 
high-quality resolution allowed by that 
page-description language. 

Since graphics are meant to be pre- 
sented in color, Pinstripe has drivers for 
the HP PaintJet, the popular color ink- 
jet printer: and the Polaroid Palette 
Plus Film Printer, for making color 
slides and instant prints. The program 
can also use MAGICorp's network of 
slide-making service bureaus: You send 
the files to the nearest bureau via mo- 
dem and MAGICorp returns the slides 
the next day. 

Pinstripe Presenter's slide-show 
module. Screen Director, lets you dis- 
play charts on the computer screen. 
You can show each new graphic by hit- 
ting a key or automate the process by 
defining the order and length of time 
you want to show each chart. 

There's some heavy competition in 
the business-graphics arena, including 
Software Publishing's Harvard Graph- 
ics, which has been around for a few 
years and has gone through several evo- 
lutionary stages. In a head-on features 
comparison. Pinstripe Presenter comes 
up a bit short. 

Spinnaker has made an honest ef- 
fort to make Pinstripe simple to use, but 
I didn't find it as easy to get into as 
Harvard Graphics. The layers of menus 
you must move through to get to a par- 
ticular function remain on the screen; 
this is meant to show you where you've 
been and how to get back, but it also 
clutters the work area. The menus 
themselves aren't especially intuitive, 
so you will definitely have to read the 
manual — but that's typical for most 
MS-DOS applications. Pinstripe does 
offer online help to get you past any 
sticking point. 

Some of the more unusual types of 
data graphics, such as x/y graphs, high/ 
low-close charts, and error bar charts, 
can't be produced automatically with 
Pinstripe Presenter. Nor are its printed 
results quite as elegant as the ones pro- 
duced by Han-ard Graphics. In fact, 
some options, such as three-dimensional 
horizontal bar charts with four or more 
values, produce downright ugly charts. 
(Of course, any package will produce 



ugly charts if you give it the right infor- 
mation. Perhaps we should ban three- 
dimensional charts from business 
graphics altogether.) 

One feature not included in Pin- 
stripe Presenter which, judging by most 
of the business charts I've seen, is an 
absolute necessity: a spelling checker. 

Still, the program does most of the 
other things that Harvard Graphics 
does, but at a significantly lower cost. 
With a little practice, you can make the 
standard word, pie, and bar charts re- 
quired for business reports with a mini- 
mum of fuss. In most cases, that's all 
the typical user of a business-graphics 
package needs.

Life & Death 



Let me tell you right off the bat: You'd 
never want me to operate on you. I have 
a hard lime clipping my nails and get- 
ting splinters out of my feet. 

But thanks to Life & Death's com- 
puter-simulated doctor/in stnjctor, Da- 
vid Lindstrom, and the wonderfully 
automated hospital staff at Toolworks 
General, I'm progressing rapidly in my 
surgical residency. I may have lost a few 
dozen patients, but I'm progressing. 

Software Toolworks' Life & Death 
comes complete with three disks, a 
message beeper, several pieces of print- 
ed material, some nibber gloves, and a 
face mask — all you need to begin your 
residency. 

Donning the mask and gloves, I set 
about copying the disks onto my hard 
drive and leafing through the printed 
material. Let's see — an orientation 
memo to all first-year residents from Dr. 
Lindstrom, an operating-procedures 
manual, an excerpt from Anatomy and 
the Surgical Technique, and a hand- 
some booklet containing "A Brief, 
Bloody History of Surgery. " Must have 
been written by an Englishman. 

The manual, subtitled "Running

Life & Death on Your IBM PC/XT/ AT 
or Compatible," explains the system re- 
quirements and installation procedures. 
You can use a mouse, keyboard, or joy- 
stick — all work well. 

When the program started, I found 
myself in the Abdominal Ward of Tool- 
works General Hospital, looking down 
a long hall. Standing at a desk was an 
attractive nurse named Monica Pierce, 
who asked me to sign in. 




Playing doctor in Lite & Death is a cut 
above other sifnulations. 



I wanted to hang around and talk 
to Monica, but she informed me (in 
cartoon captions) that I had a phone 
message. Using the beeper that comes 
with the game (a paper decoder wheel, 
printed to look like a beeper, which acts 
as copy protection), I called Dr. Naylor 
at his car phone and was asked to look 
at one of his patients. "He's in Room 2, 
the second door on your right," Nurse 
Pierce told me as I spilled coffee on my 
pants. The next thing I knew, I was off 
to treat my first patient! 

Entering the room, I discovered a 
male patient in his mid-30s lying mo- 
tionless on the bed. Using the mouse to 
point at a clipboard at the end of the 
bed, I clicked and the patient's chart ap- 
peared on the screen. Uh huh . . . I 
see . . . 1 see. The patient suffers from 
several symptoms, Including abdominal 
pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, high 
fever, and loss of appetite. I began to feel 
around his abdomen. "Ouch!" he 
screeched from the speaker of my PC 
clone. "Yikes!" This surprised the heck 
out of me, since Fd never heard my PC 
talk before. But my surprise faded when 
I realized I had a suffering patient in 
my care. It was up to me to ease his 
affliction. 

I consulted my copy of Anatomy 
and the Surgical Technique and deter- 
mined that my patient had acute ap- 
pendicitis. I recommended an opera- 
tion. Soon the operating room was 
ready to roll and I was standing in front 
of a patient and a slew of foreign-look- 



ing instruments. They looked pretty 
sharp. "Aren't you going to put the pa- 
tient under first?" one of my assistants 
asked. 

Of course, I thought, then — 
whoops! I accidentally stuck the patient 
in the side with the scissors. My PC 
screamed, 

A very angry Dr. Lindstrom ap- 
peared on the screen: "I am outraged at 
your unbelievable incompetence! Re- 
port to medical school at once." 

At medical school. I learned how 
careless it was to start cutting the pa- 
tient without first putting him under. 
But 1 got another chance. I didn't want 
to blow it again, so I carefully read all 
the documentation before seeing my 
next patient. It didn't help. I only x- 
rayed the patient when I should have 
operated. I made many more careless 
mistakes in medical procedure (some- 
times resulting in the death of patients), 
went back to medical school, and, with 
newfound knowledge, treated more 
people. I soon understood that at Tool- 
works General you learn through direct 
experience. Once I had a few successes 
under my belt, 1 found myself on the 
honor roll — even after I'd lost several 
patients! 

Life d Death 's graphics are very 
detailed in CGA mode, make good use 
of four colors, and provide some slight 
humor. The sound effects, coming out 
of my computer's little speaker, sound- 
ed like digital samplings of actual 
voices and added a stunning realism to 
the program — especially when a patient 
really hurt. The point-and-click user in- 
terface worked very smoothly — much 
more smoothly than my own trembling 
hands. 

As it says on the box, don't use this 
program if you're faint of heart! The 
blood looks real. Even though I knew it 
was only pixels, it made me a little 
queasy to look into the abdominal cavi- 
ty of a patient. But Dr. Lindstrom says 
I'm going to make a fine surgeon, some- 
day. Now, if] can only trim this hang- 
nail. . . .

Steel Thunder 



A jet fighter primed for Mach 2 combat 
is sleek and sexy, A tank, 60-plus tons 
squatting on the ground, is, well, a tank. 
No wonder, then, that it's only now that 
modern ground-combat simulations are 
hitting the computer-gaming scene. 
Most of us would rather soar with the 
eagles than slog through the mud. Acco- 
lade's Steel Thunder, the first tank 
simulation/game on the shelves, hopes 
to change those opinions. The game has 
its work cut out for it.

Command your own armored fighter 
against the enemy in Sfee( Thunder. 

Steel Thunder introduces you to 
the world of modern, high-tech land 
warfare. You can roll onto the battle- 
field in an MlAI Abrams, an M3 Brad- 
ley Fighting Vehicle, or either of two 
versions of the Pat ton Tank: the up- 
dated M60A3 or the old standby, the 
M48A5. You can take the driver's, gun- 
ner's, or commander's position. Taking 
the commander's position won't always 
free you from the other jobs, however, 
because fiying metal shards might take 
out one of the other crew members. 

Each machine comes fully load- 
ed — no stripped-down dealer models 
here. You get all the bells and whistles, 
including laser range finders, thermal 
targeting sights, automatic gun stabiliz- 
ers, ballistics computers, and automatic 
transmission. And don't forget the 
weapons — an impressive array of fire- 
power that'll impress any jet jockey. 

Pack your holster with a variety of 
armed acronyms: APFSDS (Armor- 
Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sa- 
bot), a super-high-speed tank killer that 
can jjenetrate 1 5 inches of steel; HEAT 
(High-Explosive Anti-Tank), which lit- 
erally burns through metal; HEP (High- 
Explosive Plastic), good against 
bunkers or thin-skinned flammable tar- 
gets; APERS (Anti-PERSonnel), for 
neutralizing infantry forces); and TOW 
(Tube-launched Optically tracked Wire- 
guided) missiles, multipurpose weapons 
that can blast through armor or punch 
windows in concrete bunkers. !>•

n REVIEWS 



You begin your career as a corpo- 
ral on a quick training mission. After 
you've qualified for battle, you are sent 
to ihe from in Cuba. (Why we're fight- 
ing in Cuba is never explained — odd 
plate for a tank battle.) A panicular ve- 
hiele is recommended at the start of 
oath mission, but you can take a differ- 
ent one. You are also told which rank 
)ou will be promoted to should your 
mission be successful, as well as which 
medals may be awarded. 

Before you hit that dusty trail, 
however, you must select a crew. Pick 
your gunner, loader, and driver from a 
list of candidates. The list rates each 
crewman on various aspects of his job. 
You'll have to make tradeoffs: The fast- 
est loader may fatigue quickly, for ex- 
ample. Careful attention to crew 
selection, especially when choosing the 
loader, will increase your chances of 
success. 

Once the mission has begun, oper- 
ating the tank from the commanders 
position can be confusing. But by using 
the Command Override controls, you 
can "slave" the main turret to follow 
your field of view, which makes aiming 
easier. 

The graphics in Sieel Thunder suit 
the purpose but are hardly state-of-the- 
art. Some of the targets appear as repre- 
sentational icons rather than real- 
looking images. Infantr\' troops are 
symbolized by three stick figures hold- 
ing hands. Still, the silhouettes do con- 
tain information: You can judge their 
direction of movement, and they do get 
laigcrasyouclosein. 

Ft's well worth your time to read 
me fine instruction manual. In fact, 
iuu'd be hard-pressed to get your tank 
rolling without following the book's 
startup procedure. You can't just turn 
ihe key and drive it off; quite a few sys- 
tems need to be powered up or adjusted. 
You should also pay special attention 
to the manual's "Strategy and Tactics" 
seclion. which offers valuable tips that 
will increase your chances of hitting 
your targets. 

Several successful missions and 
promotions will graduate you to more 
dangerous battlegrounds. After Cuba 
comes Syria, followed by West Germa- 
ny. Only those with the rank of major 
and above are trusted with duty on the 
West German front. 

Steel Thunder is very playable and 
a lot of fun during the learning process. 
But once you have mastered the con- 
trols and learned a few tricks (like stop- 
ping to shoot while hidden by smoke), 
the missions become somewhat repeti- 
tive. After the learning phase, you'l! 
quickly move up the ranks. Most of the 

74 COMPUTE' 



game's complexity comes from learning 
to operate the tank and the various 
weapons. The use of terrain and cover 
do not enter into the game because all 
of the fighting takes place in flat, open 
spaces. 

Steel Thunder is an excellent foray 
into the relatively unexplored field of 
tank warfare. The new weapons and 
systems carry a lot of appeal. But seri- 
ous war-simulation gamers will require 
another level of difficulty to keep their 
interest.

Jigsaw 



For a change of pace, power down that 
laser cannon, holster that revolver, and 
hide that six-pack of hand grenades. 
Try solving a computerized jigsaw puz- 
zle instead. It'll be fun. Really. 

Well, maybe a quiet encounter 
with a jumbled picture isn't every- 
body's idea of a rousing good time, but 
if you like puzzles, you'll enjoy Britan- 
nica Software's Jigsaw!. 

Using pictures from its image li- 
brary or artwork imported from other 
graphics packages, /if 5a u'.' creates puz- 
zles by dividing the picture into squares 
and shuffling the squares into new posi- 
tions. You solve the puzzle by choosing 
a square and then choosing the position 
to which it should move, swapping 
pieces until they're all in the right place. 

It's an easy game, so easy that the 
manual is no more than a brochure that 
describes menu commands. Simply 
choose Open from a menu, select a pic- 
ture from the list of images, and click 
anywhere on the picture to jumble the 
puzzle. That's all you need to know to 
start playing. 

Several options affect the difficulty 
of each puzzle. For example, you can 
choose how many squares the picture 
should be divided into. You could, for 
example, create an easy puzzle by di- 
viding the picture into 16 fairly large 
pieces; but to really challenge yourself, 
you could divide the picture into 64 
small pieces. 



To further handicap yourself, you 
can turn down the sound, disabling a 
bell that signals if you've placed a piece 
correctly. You can also jumble the puz- 
zle before you see the properly assem- 
bled picture, like solving a real jigsaw 
puzzle without first seeing the package. 

These options make Jigsaw! appro- 
priate and competitive for a wide range 
of ages and skills, A young child could 
put together a 1 6-piece picture with the 
sound on. for example, while an older 
child could put together the same pic- 
ture from 32 pieces with the sound off, 
effectively giving the younger child a 
head start. 

Most of the pictures in the image 
library are stunning, like the hibiscus 
flower or the angelfish. Some are whim- 
sical, like the cartoon of Albert Einstein 
or the alphabet picture. The more com- 
plicated the artwork, the harder the 
puzzle is to solve. I spent a long time 
trying to find two swapped pieces in the 
hibiscus flower. The puzzle looked 
solved, but it wasn't quite right. 

Although they're a ready-made 
challenge, you're not limited to the pic- 
tures included with Jigsaw!. You can 
bring in files from other graphics pack- 
ages, such as Dehtxe Paint II and 
PairilWorks Gold. (I did experience 
some problems importing images from 
an older \'ersion of Deluxe Paint II, but 
Paint Works Gold worked just fine.) 
You can even digitize pictures and turn 
them into puzzles. After you save the 
picture as a screen image from your 
graphics package, you can open it in 
Jigsaw!. 




Put the pieces back together with Jigsaw!. 

Solving jigsaw puzzles is difficult 
enough, and I would have appreciated 
a feature that lets you grab several 
pieces together and swap them with 
several others. As the program stands, 
you can only swap one piece at a time, a 
bother when you find that 1 2 pieces are 
one position to the left of where they 
should be. 

So what's wrong with this picture? 
Well, if you're a real jigsaw puzzle buff. 



n REVIEWS 



Jigsaw! is only half the game. Part of 
solving a jigsaw puzzle is matching the 
shape of ihe piece as well as — or instead 
of— matching the color of the piece. 
After all, what's more challenging than 
a one-color puzzle? And I've even 
known puzzle whizzes who assemble 
the pieces upside down jusi to take 
away the picture clues. Jigsawl's break- 
ing the picture into squares eliminates 
this part of puzzle fun. 

So don't buy this software thinking 
it simulates those 1000-piece Ravens- 
berger beauties or 500-piece Spring- 
boks. Jigsaw! can entertain at several 
different skill levels, especially if you or 
your children like puzzles for the sheer 
fun of seeing what the picture looks like 
in the end,

Pages 



Everybody wants to be a desktop pub- 
lisher but not everyone has what it 
takes — the money for a top-flight pro- 
gram like Ventura Publisher or Page- 
Maker. If your computer budget is the 
Slim Whitman of your household fi- 
nancial chorus, a new program called 
Pages can provide an inexpensive way 
for you to produce your own desktop- 
published pages — but be prepared to 
sacrifice some speed and to deal with 
display irregularities. 

Unlike the big desktop publishing 
programs, Pages doesn't run under a 
graphics environment such as GEM or 
Microsoft Windows. It uses its own in- 
terface, which looks somewhat like 
Microsoft Works. Almost every com- 
mand can be accessed from the row of 
icons along the top of the screen. 

Because Pages is object oriented, 
all text and graphics are placed inside 
boxes. You can put boxes on top of 
boxes, change the order of boxes, or du- 
plicate a box once or several times — a 
feature especially useful in creating 
multiple images on a page. 

The program includes four stand- 
ard page layouts: single column, two 



column, three column, and blank (for 
your own custom formats). You can 
modify any of the standard formats or 
use them as templates. 




With Pages you can become a desktop 
publisher without breaking the bank. 

Pages lets you type directly onto 
the page or bring in text from Microsoft 
Works, Microsoft Word, WordPerfect 5, 
WordStar, or Lotus 1-2-3. Unfortunate- 
ly, it discards all attributes such as bold, 
underline, and italic. Text flows auto- 
matically through the pages, and you 
can remove text from boxes or change 
the order in which text flows through 
the boxes. By loading multiple files or 
articles, you can create fairly complex 
newsletters. 

If you type in text, the screen 
scrolls automatically. A search-and- 
replace feature helps you locate specific 
portions of your text. Even Ventura and 
PageMaker can't do that. 

You get four typefaces to work 
with: Modern (a sans-serif type that re- 
sembles Helvetica), Roman (a serif type 
similar to Century Schoolbook), Script, 
and Decorative (an Old English style). 
Font sizes range from 6 to 126 points. 
Contrary to expectations, the typefaces 
look rougher on laser printers than on 
dot-matrix printers. Because Pages 
can't use downloadable or cartridge 
typefaces, laser-printer users may not 
be satisfied with the type quality. 

To control leading, the space be- 
tween lines of text, you manipulate 
three big T's, sizing things up by eye. 
This system is intuitive and good for 
beginners, but advanced users will find 
it inaccurate. 

Pages rounds out its text-layout 
features with a large array of drawing 
tools, including lines, rectangles, round- 
ed rectangles, circles, arcs, and pie 
slices, as well as 32 fill patterns. You 
can also load bitmapped graphics from 
PC Paintbrush, The Print Shop, GEM 
Paint, and MacPaint, or you can use 
any PFS: First Publisher clip art. 

One of Pages' strengths is that it al- 
lows you to edit pictures inside the pro- 
gram. You can zoom in and edit them 
dot by dot, reverse their color, rotate 
them 90 degrees, or flip them horizon- 
tally or vertically. This strength is

-^ "Hawaiian Odyssey" Sceneiy Disk - 

Yes, our new "Hawaiian Odyssey" Sceneiy 
Disk puts Flight Simulator, Stealth Mission 
and Jet pilots in a tropical paradise! The 
islands contain many wonderful sights; one 
of them also contains a mysterious gateway 
to a fantasyland unlike anything you've ever 
seen! 

The natural beauty of Hawaii adds up to one 
great Scenery Disk. Our design team did an 
excellent job of recreating downtown 
Honolulu and Pearl Harbor on the island of 
Oahu. Flying into the crater of Mauna Loa, 
one of Hawaii's most volatile volcanoes, is 
exhilarating and perfectly safe. The 400-mile 
long Hawaiian Island chain's distinctive visual 
details, airports and radio nav-aids make it a 
perfect complement to all SubLOGlC flight 
simulation programs. 

"Hawaiian Odyssey" also offers the very first 
structured SubLOGlC Scenery Disk 
adventure! A number of clues are scattered 
about the islands. They can be located only 
by exploring each island at low altitude (and 
what better way can you think of to pass the 
time?). These clues will guide you to a very 
surprising reward; don't let anyone tell you 
about It ahead of time!

m REVIEWS 



undermined, however, by the pro- 
gram's inability to automatically wrap 
text around graphics. 

When you get ready to print, you'll 
discover more uncommon options in 
Pages' bag of tricks. The program sup- 
ports a wide range of dot-matrix print- 
ers and the LaserJet Plus, Series 11. or 
compatible laser printers. .And not only 
can you print to a printer, you can also 
create a .DCX file (similar to a .PCX 
file), which lets you manipulate an en- 
tire page like one picture; or you can 
create a file for the Intel Communica- 
tions Co-Processor, a combination 
modem/fax board. 

The excellent manual is easy to fol- 
low. It includes a complete tutorial and 
instructions for creating forms, business 
cards, and invitations. An onscreen 
help index complements the manual. 

Pages' lechnkal problems focus on 
the display. The publisher admits there 
are incompatibilities with certain 
brands of EGA and VGA graphics 
cards. My experience under EG.A and 
VGA was that the mouse pointer disap- 
peared in text mode, making it ex- 
tremely difficult to highlight text. .Also. 
the program works only in mono- 
chrome on EGA and VG.A. Further, the 
program runs sluggishly, even on an 
AT-compatible computer. 

Compared with other programs in 
the same class, Pages is harder to learn 
than PFS: First Publisher or Ne^vsroom. 
It does, however, offer you much more 
power over page design. And while it 
compares well to Publish-! ! Lite! in fea- 
tures, it's not as fast, nor are its fonts as 
good; however, Pages c&n print from la- 
ser printers, while Publish-It Lite! 
cannot. 

Overall, Pages has enough power 
to be a truly useful desktop publishing 
program for users concerned with price. 
But the rough edges could prove aggra- 
vating to fledgling publishers looking 
for a high-performance engine in an 
economy package.

Address Book 
Plus 



When it comes to managing something 
simple, like addresses, most popular 
databases handle like Sherman tanks on 
a bicycle path, forcing you to navigate 
special codes and utility menus for the 
most elementary tasks. Then, when you 
want 10 add, edit, sort, or print, you're 
locked into additional menus or se- 
quences that make the software more 
enigma than engine. 

Power Up Software has avoided 
that top-heavy clumsiness with its 
streamlined Address Book Plus (ABP). 
This package easily manages and prints 
addresses, whether for bulk mailings or 
individual birthday greetings. For my 
money, it's the software of choice for 
keeping any kind of address list — of 
friends, professional associates, or ex- 
tended family. 

This program is fast, with a lickety- 
splii versatility in search, update, and 
sort modes. If I want to print an enve- 
lope, for example. AliP can kick one 
out, including a return address, in six 
keystrokes. 

When you start ABP. a file called 
ADDRESS loads automatically and 
shows the date, filename, and number 
of existing and available records. You 
can browse, edit, delete, print, import, 
or export your records with a few key- 
strokes. To edit, for example, press En- 
ter to bring up a particular list on a 
scroll screen. Then open any record by 
moving the cursor to the pertinent data 
line and hitting Enter again. You may 
enter or create a new file by pressing the 
F4 key. 

.Adding and editing records is 
made easy with a quick-search func- 
tion. Just hit a letter key and you're in- 
stantly at that alphabetic section of 
your address directory. There's a func- 
tion key to search specific character 
combinations. .And each time a new 
name is added or an old one is altered, 
.•IBP revises the date. 

In addition to these functions, you 
may filter your address list in seconds 
(by coded subgroup) or order it by 
name, company, zip code, profession, 
comments, dale, or birthday. You can 
print your lists on a variety of paper 
sizes for popular address books, rotary 
files and index cards, mailing labels, 
and envelopes. .A set of "list by" codes 
lets you print your business associates 
by company, professionals by profes- 
sions, or friends by names. You can 
even print your own white pages or yel- 
low pages, which are organized by pro- 
fession like a city telephone book. 



If you import information from 
word processors or databases. ABP pre- 
cludes the need to reenter current data. 
(If you have phone numbers with liber- 
al spaces and parenthetical area codes. 
however, you may wind up. as I did, 
with the last phone digit missing.) The 
program works with Epson, Hewlett- 
Packard, and Okidala laser printers as 
well as with conventional printers. If 
you want to print address books, your 
printer must produce compressed type 
of 15-20 characters per inch. 




Address Book Plus provides versatility 
and speed in a welt-focused package. 



Perhaps the program's neatest util- 
ity is a letter-code filter that lets you 
print up to ten subgroups from the 
main list — letting you cull whatever 
smaller data pool you stipulate. If, for 
example, you want to print a directory 
of your friends, your spouse's friends, 
business contacts, and club members all 
at once, just filter the list with the perti- 
nent codes. 

Listings allow a company name, 
three phone numbers, a three-line ad- 
dress, a profession, birthday, and com- 
ments. ABP is a perfect system for 
flexible business mailings to sales con- 
tacts or vendors: it handles all but bulk 
mailings in the multithousandsjust 
fine. A 640K-equipped computer will 
hold as many as 1 500 names and ad- 
dresses per file (256K machines permit 
only 300). 

The number of files you can use is 
limitless. If you grouped files by state, 
for instance. ABP could conveniently 
handle up to 75,000 addresses. But 
managing discrete groups of addresses 
is so easy with ABP that you will proba- 
bly opt for one master file with coded 
subgroups. 

ABP comes with a file of toll-free 
telephone numbers of airlines, rental- 
car agencies, and hotels. It also includes 
a pen, three spiral binders, and a black 
leather DayTimer pocket address book 
with 100 sheets of tractor- feed paper 
that fit the book. 

This is the easiest name-and-

Ticket to 
Hollywood 



You're a special breed. You'll watch 
just about any classic film on TV. You 
enjoy reading about the stars and direc- 
tors, and you've always wanted to visit 
Hollywood, though you'll probably 
never actually go there. Well, here's 
your chance for a Ticket to Hollywood. 
Couch potatoes of the world, this 
game's for you. 

Ticket to Hollywood sXaits as a triv- 
ia game, with questions about movies, 
movie stars, directors, and famous Hol- 
lywood landmarks. But behind the fa- 
cade is a combination of "Sneak 
Previews," "Mystery," and The Travel 
Channel. Your ultimate goal is to dis- 
cover the identity of 25 stars — but first 
you'll have to track down the director, 
who is somewhere in Hollywood. 

Hollywood is represented by six 
maps with 35 locations, including fa- 
miliar places such as Universal Studios 
and Grauman's Chinese Theater, and 
lesser-known haunts like Gower Gulch 
and the Montecito .A.partments. By the 
time you're through with the game, 
you'll know something about each of 
these places. 

To play, choose a decade in the life 
of this not-so-typical town. The decade 
you pick determines the questions and 
places that appear on the maps. Next, 
pick a map and a starting location. 

If the director isn't at that location, 
the Movie Madame will appear instead. 
She'll ask you a few multiple-choice 
questions, such as; Do you know the ac- 
tress who won her first Oscar for Gas- 
light? What is the movie based on the

autobiography of Henry Pu Yi? Do you 
know the year Mickey Mouse was horn? 
(In case you're wondering, the answers 
are Ingrid Bergman, The Last Emperor. 
and 1928. You can figure out the other 
1997 questions yourself.) 




With your Ticket (o Hollywood in hand, 
you're ready conduct your own Star 
search. 

Correct answers earn you points 
and recharge the energy bar at the bot- 
tom of the screen. You use up energy 
each time you move to another map or 
decade. If you lose all your energy, 
you're temporarily thrown out of the 
game. 

For each 25 points you earn, you 
receive a lead to help you find the direc- 
tor. These include such arcane refer- 
ences as The Lady in Black, Lloyd 
Wright's Design, and See HolK"wood 
Tudor, You can usually figure out the 
leads from the Hollywood Scenes card, 
which gives a brief historical descrip- 
tion of each location. 

Once you've deciphered a lead, 
you can go directly to the director's lo- 
cation, where the director will ask you a 
superquestion. If you answer the super- 
question correctly, you'll receive a clue 
to a star's identity. These cinematic 
snippets include such obscure things as 
Star's Wife Wrote E.T., Red Dust Star 
in Court, and A Salt Lake Inspiration. 

Once you've gathered enough clues 
to guess the star's name, you can go to 
the Walk of Fame on Map 5 to type in 
your answer. If you're right, you go 
back to the beginning to start the whole 
process over again — until you've dis- 
covered each of the 25 stars. 

It's a lot of work, so here are a few 
tips to make the game go faster. Watch 
your spelling when answering the direc- 
tor's superquestion — it has to be letter- 
perfect. To aid your spelling and jog 
your memory, you might want to pick 
up a book like Leonard Mahin 's TV 
Movies and Video Guide or H alii well's 
Fitmgoer's Companion. (These are two 
of the best film reference books 
around.) 

.After you have deciphered the lead 



and are read)' to find the director, it's 
also a good idea to move to the decade 
you know best. That way you'll have a 
better chance of answering his 
questions. 

Overall, the game is very playable. 
The elaborate structure adds interest to 
what could have been just another triv- 
ia game. It takes anywhere from 20 
minutes to three hours to uncover a 
star, so finding all 25 stars is a real chal- 
lenge. If you have a short attention span 
(or you need a break for a quick double 
feature), the game automatically saves 
your progress when you quit. The selec- 
tion of questions is also quite good and 
well within the mainstream of Holly- 
wood film. 

My major complaint with the pro- 
gram is that, even with 2000 questions, 
many of the same ones keep popping 
up — sometimes twice in a row, That 
may make it easier to score points, but 
it also makes the game far less 
interesting. 

Despite this one problem. Ticket to

Rate this one two thumbs up.

Writer 64 



Commodore 64 users who work under 
Berkeley Softworks' GEOS already 
have a sturdy entry-level word proces- 
sor in geolVrite, a program bundled 
with the operating system. But if that 
serviceable package doesn't meet your 
needs, you have an alternative: Writer 
64, a prose puncher that sacrifices a 
what-you-see-is-what-you-get display 
for speed, grace, and performance. 
Writer 64 and geoWriie share 
many similarities, but there are some 
important differences. For instance, 
you set left and right margins and tabs 
in geoWrite by pointing and clicking on 
a horizontal ruler, which remains at the 



lop of the screen. With Writer 64. you 
set margins by entering specific values 
in a dialog box that appears when you 
select Margin from the Page menu or 
enter the appropriate keyboard equiva- 
lent; you can't tell what your settings 
are by simply looking at the screen. 

A more noticeable difference be- 
tween the two word processing systems 
is that Writer 64. unlike ^raW'me, 
doesn't display fonts or special text 
styles while you're in the editing mode. 
Instead, text attributes are designated 
by @. Whenever you move the cursor 
onto one of these symbols, the specific 
attribute it represents (underiine or ital- 
ic, for example) is listed in a Status Box 
at the top of the screen. The result is 
faster operation because, unlike geo- 
Write, Writer 64 doesn't have to redraw 
the entire screen after certain opera- 
tions. All of the text on Writer 64'% edit- 
ing screen appears in the same font and 
size. This uniformity allows rapid scroll- 
ing and cursor movement throughout 
any single section of a Writer 64 
document. 

Sections are part and parcel of 
Writer 64. It organizes documents into 
sections, which in turn make up a file 
(each file can include as many as 120 
sections, with each section containing 
up to 7424 characters). Depending on 
the fonts and type styles used, each sec- 
tion equals 2-5 pages of text. Within a 
file, sections are numbered consecutive- 
ly; you can access them by using the 
Next Section or Goto Section com- 
mands in the File menu. Other File 
menu selections let you dump a text file 
to disk as a sequential ASCII file (useful 
for telecommunications or conversion 
to other word processing formats), in- 
sert geoPaim graphics into your text, or 
print your document. 

Writer 64 offers most standard 
editing functions through its Edit 
menu. You can mark blocks of text for 
cutting, copying, or pasting; you can 
also search and replace text strings. The 
Edit menu also contains a Check Spell- 
ing option that uses the program's built- 
in 100,000-word dictionary to check 
your documents for incorrect spelling 
before printing. 

To control paragraph indentions, 
centering, justification, page breaks, 
and tabs, you use the Format menu. 
For margins and spacing parameters, 
you use the Page menu. The Style menu 
lets you select various fonts and assign 
special attributes to your text. All stand- 
ard GEOS fonts are compatible with 
Writer 64, and the available text styles 
include bold, underiine, italics, outline, 
subscript, superscript, and reverse. 

Writer 64'% Special menu lets you

create headers and footers for your doc- 
uments and chain separate files togeth- 
er for printing with sequential page 
numbers. You can also place merge 
marks into your text where you would 
Hke data from another file inserted — a 
simple way of personalizing form letters 
by merging them with an address list. 

If you want to gain even more 
speed, most of the editing, style, and 
formatting commands have keyboard 
equivalents, which are listed alongside 
the corresponding menu selections. 
These quick keys also appear on help 
screens and in the quick reference sec- 
tion of the Writer 64 manual. 

Before you print your document, 
you can fine-tune it further by preview- 
ing it on the screen. Simply select Show 
Full Page or Show Reduced from the 
Page menu. The full-page view displays 
all of the fonts, text styles, and graphics 
exactly as they will appear on the print- 
ed page. Unfortunately, to get an idea of 
what the entire page looks like, you 
must use the Show Reduced option, 
which displays an illegible but accurate 
graphic representation of the page. Only 
when the text appears on an oversized 
page can it actually be read, and then 







Writer 64 runs under GEOS and features 
spell-check and merge capabilities. 

you can see only about one-eighth of 
the page at a time. When you're satis- 
fied with your document, you can print 
a fast mode (essentially a printout of 



your editing screen), a draft mode 
(which reproduces all fonts and style 
attributes with a single pass of the 
printhead), or a quality mode (for the 
final copy on printers with near-letter- 
quality capability). 

Writer 64 performs most of the 
functions of geoWrite, geoMerge, and 
geoSpell. Whether it's a better choice 
for you depends on how much you're 
taken with Writer 64 's faster display 
speed. \fgeoWrite'% display delays 
don't bother you, there's little reason to 
change to Writer 64. But if you find 
those delays unbearable, you might 
want to switch. In either case, GEOS 
users benefit from finally having a word 
processing choice.

Digi-View Gold 



The diiTerences between Digi-View 3.0 
and Digi-View Gold are so minor that 
one might call NewTek's latest release 
Deja- View. The major change makes 
Digi-View Gold plug-compatible with 
the Amiga 500 and Amiga 2000. (It can 
also be used with the Amiga 1000, but a 
gender changer is required to hook it to 
the AlOOO's nonstandard parallel port.) 
Some parts of the software have also 
been refined, as has the dithering algo- 
rithm which gives Digi-View images 
such clarity. 

Like its predecessor, Digi-View 
Gold turns the image from a video 
camera into a color Amiga picture in 
any of the Amiga's display formats, in- 
cluding hold-and-modify (HAM), which 
allows 4096 colors on the screen at the 
same time. It works by means of a hard- 
ware and software combination: The 
hardware component is a composite- 
video-to-RGB encoder interface box 
about the size of a Chunky bar that 
plugs into the Amiga's parallel port. 
The program's image-processing soft- 
ware controls the encoder functions and 
lets you modify the Digi-View Gold 
scans in some amazing ways. 

To use Digi-View Gold, you must 
have a source of monochrome or color- 
composite video (standard TV-type 
video) generated by a camera. VCR 
video won't work with Digi-View. 
NewTek recommends (and sells) an in- 
dustrial monochrome CCTV camera, 
Panasonic's WV-1410, noted for its res- 
olution and clear picture. Digi-View 
Gold creates color pictures from a 
black-and-white camera image by scan- 
ning the image three times, once for 
each of the video primary colors — red, 
green, and blue — using a plastic color- 
filter wheel. The wheel, included in the 
package, hooks onto the camera's tri- 
pod mount hole (or you can use Velcro 
tape) so that the lens focuses through 
the appropriate color filter. 

If you're reluctant to pay S240 for 
the Panasonic or a similar CCYV cam- 
era, you can get started with your own 
camcorder and trade up later. But keep 
in mind that you'll start with poorer 
pictures. If you use a monochrome cam- 
era other than NewTek's recommended 
model, make sure it outputs 2: 1 inter- 
lace video, not random interlace — Digi- 
View can't handle random interlace, 
(The WV-1 140 has an internal switch 
that lets you flip back and forth be- 
tween the two types of interlace.) 

To start, hook up the camera to 
any composite monitor and use the 
monitor image to aim and focus the 
camera on the subject (a photograph of 



a rose, for example). You can use your 
.Amiga monitor for this; just switch the 
monitor to composite and plug the 
camera into the video-in jack in the 
back of the monitor. For best color 
fidelity, illuminate the subject with flu- 
orescent rather than incandescent light- 
ing. Once you have the image 
positioned, load the Digi-View Gold 
software, switch your monitor to RGB, 
and hook up the camera to the Amiga 
through the interface box. 




You can plug Digi-View Gold right into 
your Amiga 500 or 2000 for processing 
video images. 

Upon loading, the software will ask 
you what kind of scan format and 
screen format you plan to use. You can 
choose any screen format, two levels of 
overscan, and whether you'll be digitiz- 
ing in gray scales or color. Next, choose 
Digitize from the menu bar. If you scan 
in color, you'll take three scans, turning 
the color-filter wheel each time so that 
the camera takes a picture through the 
appropriate filter. Leave the subject sta- 
tionary until the scanning process is 
complete. (You can experiment with 
distortion by moving the subject during 
the scan, creating some interesting 
effects.) 

Digi-View Gold combines the 
three images into one full-color image 
and then dithers the colors to smooth 
out any banding, fringing, and other 
scanning residue. In interlace H.A.M 
mode, the picture looks just like regular 
TV — sharp, clear, and with thousands 
of colors. 

You can print your scans, save 
them as IFF files (compatible with 
Amiga paint and desktop publishing 
programs), or save them as raw RGB 
data for later processing. The raw RGB 
files contain enough information to dis- 
play more than 2 million colors on the 
screen. The Amiga currently doesn't 
have a display mode that can handle 
that many colors, but future image pro- 
cessing boards for the Amiga may offer 
that capability. 



Digi-View's image-processing ca- 
pabilities are limited but powerful. You 
can change the brightness, contrast, and 
sharpness of the scan, adjust the RGB 
setting of any or all of the colors, and 
use the complements of all the scanned 
colors to create color negative images. 
For desktop publishing, you can choose 
to digitize in only a few colors or adjust 
the scanning process for line art. 

In the final analysis, owners of 
Digi-View 3.0 really don't need to up- 
grade to Digi-View Gold because the 
improvements are small, if welcome. 
But if you're still using Digi-View 1.0 or 
2.0, or if you're just getting into digitiz- 
ing, you should definitely grab this 
package; it's the best video digitizer cur- 
rently available for the Amiga or any 
other personal computer.

There's Gold in Them There 
Hills 

Sierra has released a new 3-D adventure 
game designed to be educational and 
entertaining. Gold Rush! recreates life 
in ihe 1 850s and simulates Americans' 
historical movement to the California 
coast in search of fortune. 

Players must travel by one of three 
ways from New York to California; 
each journey has unique perils. One 
way west is by ship to Panama, then 
through the jungles of the isthmus 
(there was no Panama Canal), and fi- 
nally by ship 10 California. Another 
way across the country is by stagecoach, 
canal boat, steamer, and wagon train. .A 
third option is to sail around Cape 
Horn and then on to California. 

Gold Rush! is now available for 
IBM PCs and compatibles on five 5'/i- 
inch and two 3V2-inch disks in the same 
package. The game supports CGA, 
EGA. MCGA. VG.A. and Hercules 
monochrome graphics. Gold Rush! will 
soon be available for the Apple II, Mac- 
intosh, .A,tari ST, and Amiga. The IBM 
version has a suggested retail price of 
$39.95.

Play it Again, PC 

With Activision's MS-DOS version of 
The Music Studio 3.0, you can create 
original compositions and orchestrate 
playback, taking advantage of your 
computer's sound capabilities. 

The program lets you modify tem- 
po, note duration, instruments, and 
volume. Edit options include cut, copy, 
paste, and undo functions; a hold-and- 
slide technique thai allows a change in 
individual note durations; inserting, 
copying, and moving blocks; replacing 
instruments; lengthening and shorten- 
ing durations; and transposition up/ 
down in one step. You can also change 
key signature, tempo, and staff type 
anytime during a song. Advanced 
MIDI capabilities provide exact play- 
back of what was originally recorded, 
assignable MIDI presets, 16 MIDI 
channels, a metronome for MIDI re- 
cording, and modifiable MIDI parame- 
ters; in addition, they allow for the 
ability to change instruments during 
MIDI input. 



Mickey McLean 



The Music Studio 3.0 requires 
512K of RAM on IBM PC-and-com- 
patible computers, including the Tandy 
1000 series. The program includes 
Tandy DeskMate runtime software and 
requires MS-DOS version 3.2 or higher: 
a CGA, Tandy 1 6-color, EGA, VGA, or 
Hercules monochrome card; and a 
Tandy or other Microsoft-compatible 
mouse or a Tandy joystick. Available in 
both 3'/2-inch and S'/i-inch disk formats, 
the program carries a price lag of 
$99.95.

the Amiga reminds users of up to 99 
events a day. Nag Plus 3.0 is a memory- 
resident program that can synthesize 
sounds using the Amiga voice and 
sound hardware. 

Make one-time entries of events 
such as birthdays; the program places 
them in a perpetual calendar. Events or 
appointments can be edited up to two 
years in advance. The program can re- 
mind the user with a screen flash, a 
computerized voice, or with any one of 
24 different sounds. .A report generator 
prints a list of each day's appointments 
and can search the appointment data- 
base for individual records by using a 
key word. Nag Plus 3.0 can also dial the 
computer's modem. 

.Additional features include a text 
editor, an online help facility, and an 
ARexx port for initiating any timed 
event or action. Nag Plus 3.0 has a sug- 
gested retail price of $79,95.

For Apple-noids 

Taito Software has released an Apple II 
and IIgs conversion of the arcade game 
Arkanoid. 

The game is set in outer space, 
where a player's survival depends upon 
penetrating complex walls by firing la- 
sers and energy balls from a maneuver- 
able spacecraft. Players must battle 
their way through 33 screens of grad- 
uated difficulty. 

The Apple version of Arkanoid re-

Murder Mystery 

Agatha Christie fans can now solve a 
murder mystery on their IBM PC or 
Apple II with The Scoop, from Spinna- 
ker Software. The game is based on an 
Agatha Christie story and on members 
of the London Detection Club. 



Set in London during the 1930s, 
The Scoop lets you assume the role of a 
Daily Courier reporter assigned to cov- 
er the mysterious murder of Geraldine 
Tracey. Rival reporters at the Morning 
Star have a head start on the case. To 
beat them to the story and solve the 
crime, you must work quickly to ques- 
tion witnesses, follow suspects, and 
search for clues. But be careful: The 
killer might like to get rid of a trouble- 
some reporter. 

The game uses graphics and text to 
tell the story. Menus help you interro- 
gate suspects, eavesdrop on conversa- 
tions, search rooms, and gather 
evidence, Over 30 animated characters 
and more than 80 locations can be 
found in the game. 

The Scoop for the IBM PC and 
compatibles requires CGA; a 512K ver- 
sion that supports EGA or VGA graph- 
ics is also available. The game also 
comes in an .Apple 11 version. All ver- 
sions sell for $39.95.

Learn A to Z on a PC 

Optimum Resource, publisher of 
Weekly Reader Software, has released 
The Sticky'bear Alphabet for MS-DOS 
computers. The program features three 
activities designed to complement and 
encourage alphabet learning in children 
ages 3 to 6. 

The first activity, Alphabet, dis- 
plays an animated scene illustrating the 
letter the child has pressed. In Letter 
Hunt, children find a requested letter 
on the keyboard, and then an animated 
scene appears. The third activity, Fast 
Letters, allows children to select any let- 
ter to appear on the screen along with 
Stickybear. 

The Stickybear Alphabet is avail- 
able on both 3'/2-inch and 5'/)-inch disks 
and runs on the IBM XT, AT, PS/2, 
and compatibles. It requires 512K of 
RAM and a 3'/2-inch floppy drive or 
two 5'/t-inch drives with DOS 3.0 or 
greater. The program supports EGA, 
MCGA, VGA, or Tandy 16-color 
graphics. Users can also install the pro- 
gram on their hard disk. The speech ca- 
pability requires an Echo Board; the 
program can be used without speech. 

The suggested retail price is $49.95. 
Lab packs, which include five sets of 
program disks and an instruction man- 
ual, are available for schools at a sug- 



gested retail price of $85. Versions of 
the program have been previously re- 
leased for the Apple II and Commodore

Stay Dry Diving 

Macintosh users can explore the ocean 
floor with MacScitba, a scuba-diving 
simulator from Paradise Software. De- 
signed by divers, the program can be 
enjoyed by experienced divers as well 
as by those who have never dived. 

The program allows for multilevel 
decompression and no-decompression 
dives, using the U.S. Navy Dive tables 
as a guide for decompression stops and 
surface-time intervals. Users have com- 
plete control of the dive, from obtaining 
neutral buoyancy with the buoyancy- 
compensator device to releasing the 
weight belt in an emergency ascent to 
the surface. 

A marine database comes with the 
program to explain the creatures en- 
countered while you're exploring. Users 
can also search a sunken pirate wreck 
for treasure. The amount of treasure 
brought to the surface determines the 
player's score.

one from your insurance agenl or realtor. 
Either of those will indelibly brand the bear- 
er as an irredeemable geek for life. Pick up a 
foreign job with an incomprehensible com- 
pany name. Any German company whose 
name ends mfabrikwerk will do the job 
nicely, regardless of whether the company is 
involved in the production of semiconduc- 
tors or schniticl. 

Maintain a proper diet. When asked if 
you're interested in going out for a meal, al- 
ways suggest pizza. Don't worry about the 
time of day. Suggesting a double pepperoni 
with anchovies at seven in the morning tells 
people that you're so absorbed in the art of 
programming that you've iost ail track of 
time. If forced to dine at establishments spe- 
cializing in French nouvclle cuisine (literal 
translation: small portions), stand firm. 
When your waitperson rolls up the dessert 
cart to present the fresh kiwi flan, Linzer 
tort, and cherry kirsch cheesecake, look him 
or her in the eye and ask for a Twinkle with 
a scoop of Haagen Dazs. Your work area 
should always be cluttered with a half-dozen 
empty cups of coffee and a wall of empty 
cans from any caffeine-bearing beverage. 

Acquire appropriate accessories. For 
reasons as closely guarded as the original 
formula of Coca-Cola, ace programmers 
have an overwhelming fondness for Hewlett- 
Packard calculators. Truly dedicated bit- 
twiddlers have even attempted to have HP- 
f 6Cs surgically implanted in their forearms. 
Forget about learning how to actually pro- 
gram the things, but do take the time to 
master the rudiments of basic arithmetic op- 
erations. Most Hewlett-Packard calculators 
use a delightfully unambiguous, but decid- 
edly perverse, mode of entry called Reverse 
Polish Notation. To the uninitiated in RPN, 
such a calculator will be proof enough that 
you're an advance scout for an alien inva- 
sion force. 

Flow charting, the process of creating 
pictorial diagrams to outline the logical flow 
of programs, now qualifies as a lost art in 
most organizations. Purchase a dozen flow- 
chart templates, preferably made of clear 
green plastic. Don't bother creating any flow 
charts with them, though — using them con- 
spicuously as bookmarks is enough. 

Programming and musical taste. The 
programming subculture embraces an em- 
barrassing diversity of acceptable musical 
tastes. Real programmers can stomach just 
about anything, from Serbo-Croation caril- 
lon medleys to Def Leppard. What you lis- 



ten to is not as important as what you use to 
listen. As Marshall McLuhan opined, "The 
medium is the message." The only accept- 
able means of musical reproduction for pro- 
gramming hotshots are compact disc and 
digital audiotape players. Special dispensa- 
tion and additional points for style have 
been granted to a few individuals who have 
opted for Edison wax cylinder machines. 

One thing to avoid. Never come within 
arm's length of a functional computer 
equipped with a programming language. 
You might be asked to knock out a few lines 
of code if you come loo close to such a ma- 
chine. If you use a micro yourself the sys- 
tem should be left disassembled on your 
desk, with a soldering pencil and volt ohm- 
meter casually placed on top of the mother- 
board. If anyone asks what's wrong, answer 
that you're adding transputing support to 
the hardware. If offered the use of someone 
else's machine, haughtily decline the offer of 
anything less than a 30-MHz 68030- or 
80386-based system. If you work in a corpo- 
rate mainframe environment, bury your ter- 
minal under a pile of printouts. 

.\mazing the natives. Most micro- 
processors have commands in their reper- 
toire that don't function as originally 
intended and are therefore not referenced in 
standard reference works and programming 
texts. You can use these undocumented 
commands to effectively boggle the minds 
of your programming associates. Purchase 
copies of the original design specifications of 
your favorite microprocessor from Intel. 
Motorola, or Zilog and memorize a few 
choice undocumented opcodes. The next 
time someone turns the conversation to 
machine-level programming, wait for the 
appropriate moment to start waxing poetic 

about the virtues of using (insert 

favorite undocumented opcode here). Hold 
firm against the blank stares and your 
friends will inevitably yield to self-doubt. 
After having searched in vain for your pet 
opcode in every available programming ref- 
erence guide, someone will try it anyway 
and be completely flabbergasted when it 
successfully executes. When tastefully exe- 
cuted, this gambit is usually sufficient to 
raise one's status among programmers at 
least to junior deity. After that, you can 
spend your time philosophizing about the 
big opcode in the sky, forget about program- 
ming, and run for president of your local 
computer user group, or, if you're unquali- 
fied for that high position, for Vice Presi- 
dent of the United States. Q

You, Too, Can 

Look Like a 

Programmer 



ARLAN LEVITAN 



As the theme of this issue might tend 
to suggest, programming is back in 
vogue. While there are doubtless 
many who would claim that programming 
has never gone out of style, a bit of self- 
indulgent retrospective will firmly establish 
that, like the performance of the stock mar- 
ket, the popularity of hobbyist programming 
tends to move in somewhat spastic, but pre- 
dictable, cycles. 

Back in the early seventies, assuming 
you hadn't electrocuted yourself while put- 
ting together an Altair or Imsai kit, pro- 
gramming a microcomputer meant using a 
series of toggle switches to enter low-level 
machine code instructions into your system. 
Carefiil hours of manipulating the switches 
allowed you to turn the LEDs of the front 
panel display on and olTal will. The process 
was much less interesting and far more te- 
dious than the actual assembly of the ma- 
chine. Programming was something you did 
after the fact, since there had to be some rea- 
son for spending $3,000 for the thing. 

The development of the BASIC pro- 
gramming language and its widespread 
diffusion into microcomputers made it pos- 
sible to perform valuable tasks with person- 
ally written programs. Almost anyone could 
master a score of commands in a few hours 
and then proceed to ruin a formerly rock- 
solid marriage by burning three months of 
free time tr>'ing to find the last bug in a bio- 
rhythm or hangman program. The wide- 
spread use of BASIC even affected the funda- 
mental underpinnings of our concepts of 
space and time by completely redefining the 
meaning of the phrasc/Zfc more minutes. 

In the late seventies and eariy eighties, 
it became clear that BASIC was no longer 
"in" and that assembly language was far too 
obtuse for most computer hobbyists. Thus 
the ranks of computer hobbyists split into 
two groups: those who wanted to write pro- 
grams and those who wanted to use those 
programs and influence what should be 
written in the future. 

I have a confession to make; Although 
most of my friends elected to keep coding, I 
haven't written what I'd consider to be a 
rea/ program in more than seven years. Now 
that programming is back in style, I'm not 
even sure I want to. I spent more hours than 
I care to think about knocking out code be- 
tween 1965 and 1980. My corporate pro- 
gramming experience culminated in writing 
a pleasantly elegant control program in IBM 
370 assembler for a mainframe online appli- 
cation. While the experience was quite satis- 



fying, it did tend to produce a negative sort 
of programming tunnel vision. As my pro- 
ject was ncaring completion, I woke up one 
morning and realized thai I had virtually se- 
ceded from the human race for half a year. 
The gentle approach of spring, the bloom of 
fresh morning glories, the joyful chirp of the 
robin, and the attendant Motor City ritual 
of playing chicken on Woodward Avenue 
with careless pedestrians had passed by me 
unnoticed. 

By the time 1 got involved with micro- 
computers, the only programming I had in- 
terest in was NBC's Thursday night lineup. I 
was far more curious about the hardware 
and the human dynamics of the emerging 
industry itself 

With peer pressure building on all 
fronts, it's getting harder and harder to "just 
say no" to learning to program in C or some 
otiier fashionable language. There has to be 
an easier way out. Why spend endless hours 
looking for bugs in DO loops and IF state- 
ments when the resplendent charisma of a 
software guru can be yours with a minimum 
of efTort? In computer programming, as in 
life and art, form often follows function. 
Careful cultivation of an appropriate image 
can lodge you in the annals of any organiza- 
tion's programming legends without your 
turning out a single line of functional code. 
.All that's required is to heed Lcvitan's Help- 
ful Hints for Simulated Power Programming 
Prowess. 

Maintain an appropriate wardrobe. The 
shiri (or blouse) is the programmer's most 
profound fashion statement. While this may 
be pushing things in temperate zones with 
chilly winters, Hawaiian shirts area must. 
Fortune 500 employees are not excluded 
from this imperative, since button-down 
models with French cuffs are available from 
finer mail-order haberdasheries serving the 
programming public (such as Crunch's of 
Bond Street). Well-heeled yupsters may opt 
for more costly Polynesian or Maltese print 
fabrics instead. For those sullr\' summer 
days that roast most executives' tootsies, ac- 
quire several pairs of formal sandals made 
from cut-down winglips. 

Plastic pocket protectors are difficult to 
effectively utilize since they've become 
closely affiliated with nerdism. This associa- 
tion has resulted more from lack of careful 
selection than from actual use. .A protector 
from some prestigious electronics firm may 
keep you pigeonholed in a low-level engi- 
neering job, but it's a far better choice than
