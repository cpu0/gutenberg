13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words) 

Several standard benchmarks were implemented in order to study the real-time performance of the 

Alsys.037 Ada Compiler for the Inmos T800 Transputer. A limited comparison to the Transputer’s 
native language, Occam, was possible. The key aspects that were investigated were the computa¬ 
tional speed, using the Whetstone benchmark, the clock resolution, delay resolution, procedure 
call overhead and general performance. These were measured using the Performance Issues 

Working Group (PWIG) test suite. The Whetstone benchmark was implemented on the T800 in both 

Ada and Occam, making this measurement the most informative.

EVALUATION OF ALSYS_037 
Ada COMPILER 


INTRODUCTION 


The Edgewood Research, Development and Engineering Center is developing a Chemical 
Biological Mass Spectrometer (CBMS) containing an embedded system which utilizes the 
INMOS T800 Transputer. Although there are several programming languages available for 
systems development on the Transputer, one of the most widely used is Occam. Occam's 
popularity can be attributed to the fact that it is a high level language designed to express parallel 
algorithms and their implementation on a network of processing components. In addition, the 
Transputer may be considered an Occam machine; Occam provides the efficiency equivalent to 
that of programming a conventional computer at the assembly language level [INMOS 88]. 
However, given the Congressional Ada Mandate (Public Law 101-511 - Sec. 8092, and Public 
Law 102-172, Sec. 8073), Ada has been designated the systems development language of choice 
for Department of Defense software projects. The objective of this project was to evaluate the 
Alsys_037 Ada compiler for the Transputer, currently the only commercially available Ada 
compiler for the Transputer. 

The general approach that was taken for this project was to run a series of software 
benchmark tests conforming to the following:

The Whetstone benchmark program [Cumow 76] was developed to compare 
processing power for scientific applications. The program goes beyond measuring pure floating 
point performance ('flops') by including features found in 'typical' scientific applications such as: 
conditional jumps, array indexing, integer arithmetic, procedure calls, and evaluation of 
elementary functions. The PIWG test suite [Pollack 90, Roy 90] contains a series of experiments 
that assist in the evaluation of processor performance, clock resolution and compilation 
efficiency. Hartstone [Weiderman 89] is a benchmarking tool for evaluating hard real-time 
performance. 

The initial plan was to test these software benchmark systems across the Intel 80x86 and 
INMOS T800 platforms using the Alsys Ada compiler for 32-bit DOS, the Alsys Ada compiler 


1 































for the Transputer, and the Meridian Ada compiler for 32-bit DOS. The quantitative results from 
these tests would then be used as the basis for conclusions and recommendations. 

TECHNICAL DISCUSSION 


HARDWARE/SOFTWARE 

The hardware system which was used to develop and test the benchmarks consisted of: 

Host system - Gateway 2000: 80486DX/33MHz, EISA, 8MB RAM 
Transputer - CSA Transputer board for PC: T800/20MHz, 4MB RAM 

Once the DOS executables were generated, timings were measured on the 386/20MHz, 
386/33MHz, and 486/33MHz systems. The 386 systems were equipped with 80387 math 
coprocessors. 

The systems software used to support the project consisted of: 

DOS 5.0 

Alsys Ada - version 5.1 - 32 bit DOS compiler 
Alsys Ada_037 - version 5.4.2 - Transputer compiler 
Meridian Ada - version 4.1.1 - 32 bit DOS compiler 
INMOS Occam Toolset - version D7205 

Early in the project, the Meridian compiler was abandoned due to the volume of compile-time 
and run-time errors encountered with code which was successfully tested in the Alsys 
environment. Time did not permit debugging and rewriting a large volume of code. Therefore, 
the revised test plan matrix conforms to the following:

ACTIVITIES 


WHETSTONE: The Whetstone benchmark has been considered somewhat a standard 
benchmark Jor a number of years. Unlike the Drystone benchmark, Whetstone is intended to 
simutr*. typical' scientific applications through its utilization of a variety of routines. It does, 
however, fall short in several categories of contemporary scientific calculations. In particular, 
it uses small arrays, no multi-dimensional arrays are employed, it is dependent on the speed of 
floating point operations, and the number of elementary function evaluations is probably atypical 
of current programming models [INMOS 91, p259]. Despite these observations, it still provides 
a legitimate baseline for the evaluation required in this project. Whetstone was successfully 
coded and tested in both Ada and Occam, and run on the 80x86 and T800 platforms. 

PIWG: The Performance Issues Working Group (PIWG) of the Association for 
Computing Machinery (ACM) has made available a series of Ada benchmarks which can be used 
in the evaluation of Ada compilers across a rangr of hardware platforms. The test suite assists 
in the evaluation of execution time and compilation time. It was determined for this project that 
the compilation time tests were of little value at this stage in the project; therefore, emphasis was 
placed on the evaluation of execution timings. In particular, there are four test areas that made 
up the critical area of performance testing. They are: 

1. Clock Resolution (A000090) This test illustrates CPU clock resolution 

available to Ada. 

2. DELAY Resolution (Y000001) Measures the resolution of the DELAY 

feature of Ada. 

3. Procedure Call Overhead (P000005/6/7) Measures procedure call overhead 

time in Ada. 

4. Hennesy Tests (A000094A-K) Series of tests which measure performance 

in a variety of areas including: recursion, 
integer and real matrix multiplication, and 
sorting (data movement). 

These tests were successfully performed in Ada on both the 80x86 and T800 platforms. 

HARTSTONE: The Hartstone benchmark is a set of timing requirements for testing a 
system's ability to handle hard real-time applications [Wciderman 89]. The complete Hartstone 
benchmark consists of five categories of tests: PH Series, PN Series, AH Series, SH Series, and 
SA Series [Weiderman 89, p5]. The only test successfully implemented in Ada to date is the PH 
Series. This test provides feedback for a set of tasks which are periodic and harmonic. 

The PH Series was successfully tested on the T800 platform in Ada; however, the 80x86 
DOS tests failed to provide reliable results. Best estimation is that as the period in milliseconds 
began to approach the clock resolution available through the Ada/DOS environment, the system 
would "hang"; apparently attributable to DOS. Therefore, the quality of comparable 80x86/T800 


3 







results was compromised. Because of deadline constraints, it was determined that the Hartstone 
benchmarks could not be successfully implemented and therefore omitted from this report. 

PROCEDURES 


All benchmark development, testing and implementation was performed on the hardware 
and software mentioned on page two. Once the executables were generated, testing was 
conducted according to figure 2 (page two;. All compilations and binding/linking optimization 
options are contained in APPENDIX A. 

RESULTS 


During this study, particular attention was paid to the clock resolution. The CBMS 
system requires 3 microsecond resolution, which is one reason the T800 was selected, since it 
is capable of 1 microsecond resolution. 

Test results are contained in the charts on the following three pages. A key point worth 
noting is that the Ada/Transputer environment is, in effect, a run-time environment. That is, the 
execution of the Ada generated code is supervised by the ISERVER. This run-time 
environment does not permit the Ada code access to the high priority one microsecond clock 
resolution available on the T800. The Occam environment, however, does permit Occam code 
one microsecond access. Therefore, perhaps one of the most interesting charts is the 
WHETSTONE comparison. The other charts, however, do provide valuable information on the 
comparison of Ada executable on 20MHz and 33MHz processors utilizing different architectures. 


CONCLUSIONS 

Real-time systems that involve events which occur with near megahertz frequencies 
require one microprocessor feature that is not supported by the 80x86 line of processors: 
microsecond resolution. This study concludes that the current Ada environments available fall 
short of providing this feature on the T800, even though it can be suppcrteH via Occam. 

A variety of options exist in the pursuit of a solution to this problem. Perhaps the most 
interesting would be that of developing a software support system using both Ada and Occam. 
This option may satisfy both the timing constraints of fast real-time systems as well as the 
Congressional Ada Mandate. One item missing in permitting this recommendation is evidence 
of the realtime timing requirements of Occam. Comparative data, such as that provided in this 
report, illustrating Occam's statistics in similar PIWG and HARTSTONE implementations would 
be helpful. Such data could provide valuable insight as to whether or not Occam may be a viable 
alternative or supplement to the Ada development environment.
