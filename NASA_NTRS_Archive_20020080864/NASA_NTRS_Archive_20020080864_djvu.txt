NASA SOFTWARE IS 
CONTRIBUTING TO 
NEW EFFICIENCY IN 
AIRLINE SCHEDULING 


F ounded in 1988, American 
Airlines Knowledge 
Systems is a group of soft- 
ware engineers who develop 
systems utilizing artificial intelli- 
gence technologies for such 
applications as aircraft mainte- 
nance, aircraft scheduling, fare 
administration, flight operations 
and computer operations. 

The group employs a variety 
or knowledge based and expert 
systems tools, among them 
CUPS (C Language Integrated 
Production System), a NASA- 
developed software package 
that was originally modeled on 
Inference Corporation's Auto- 
mated Reasoning Tool CLIPS 
was supplied to Knowledge 
Systems by NASA s Computer 
Software Management and 
I nft >rmation Center ( COSM I C ) " , 
NASA s mechanism for helping 
industrial, government and 
institutional organizations to 
improve automation efficiency 
and c< )M -e I feet i ve n e ss . 


CLIPS is used by Knowledge 
Systems for three purposes: 
as a rapid prototyping tool, to 
develop production .prototypes, 
and to develop production 
applications* An example of 
the latter is CLIPS' use in the 
airline process known as "Hub 
SlAAshing”, a knowledge based 
system that recommends 
contingency plans for American 
Airlines' System Operations 
Control (SOC) during inclement 
weather or other airport disrup- 
tions where severe schedule 
reductions must be made. 

Prior to the introduction of 
Hub SlAAshing, SOC (behnv) 
used printouts of llight opera- 
tions transactions to locate 
contingency plans manually, 
used colored markers to 
highlight candidate plans, 
weeded through the possibi li- 
lies and ranked them manually. 
This labor intensive process 
has been automated by Hub 
SI A Ashing, which integrates 


the CUPS shell with more 
traditk >n a I ted inolog res . 

With Hub SlAAshing, the 
search for appropriate patterns 
is accomplished programmati- 
cally, saving time and allowing 
SOC ci x >rd i n a t c >rs t o I u l ndle 
more difficult situations. Hub 
SlAAshing locates the candi- 
dates for schedule reductions 
and assimilates much of the 
information necessary' to facili- 
tate educated decision-making, 
thus minimizing the negative 
impact in situations where Ei 
is impossible to operate all 
flights. •
